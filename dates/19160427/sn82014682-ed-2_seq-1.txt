Wallops at Planters, Agents,

and Other Things ;
WILlr SEND COPY OF Hisb
OPINIONS TO PRESIDENT
Hawaiian Statute Passed to
Protect Island Labor From
; , Raids of. Alaska Packers
Comes in for Criticism .
President Wilson's mail about 12
days from now will contain a commu-
nicaticn,from Circuit Judge T. B, Stu-
art in which Judge Stuart designates
.Filipino labor in Hawaii as 'peon or
slave" labor
Further, he "hands it to" the plant
era and the labor recruiting agenta for
the planters In vigoroos terms. He
holds that the agents are more to
blame than the planters. -: ,
Further, he takes a judicial wallop
at Governor Plnkham, harking . back
to the time when the governor was in
the employ of the Hawaiian . Sugar
Planters' Association In .the .Philip
: pines. . . .
, Further, he delivers a solar plexus
blow at the territorial law which pro
hibits labor-recruiting In these islands
without a proper license. This law
was passed by the legislature several
yearsa go when Alaska aalmon-pack-era
were trying to grab many hundred
. laborers of the territory, sending
agents and a vessel here to get them.
Taking opportunity, through a deci
sion rendered in his court today over
the O. A. Steven case, Judge Stuart
, scored the territorial laws regarding
i labor In these islands, declaring that
"planter must cee the awa are fast
' bringing ruin to the most beautiful
spot on earth, and . that if the laws
were put up to the planter for Vote
, . he vwould, signify his disapproval ' of
"then-. :x ' -v"- "
t Though submltUag to Jhe agreement
inade yesterday between; opposing
counsel whereby Steven, pleading
guilty to four charges, was to receive
a $100 fine in one charge, and $1 In
each of the others. Judge Stuart de
clared that he saw, no reason why this
shoufd be done. He said he did not
1 approve-oi one "case more than, an
other. He made the fine in each case
a dollar, costs remitted. -
. In his decision the judge entered
fully into the Berjousness of the labor
question, dwelling5 upon the fact that
the' Introduction of 'peon" labor has
driven the Hawaiian! who once ownrd
the land out of work. . .
The decision follows, in part: r
In the above four cases, the parties
filed an agreement that defendant, up
on plea of guilty being entered, shall
bo fined one dollar in each of the
three following cases, a 6294, C. 6296
and C. C297, and the court shall remit
th costs in said cases. In the. re
maining case, C. 6295, it Is' agreed that
defendant
upon plea, of guilty by
. he 'shall be fined one hundred dollars
therein. Of course these fines are
made subject .'to the approval of the
court --.'J ' -i-' ' ; ' ' '
In accordance with the agreement,
the defendant has withdrawn his plea
of not guilty in each case, and has
filed a plea of guilty in each case, so
that virtually all questions have been
taken away from the court.
As to the legality of the la on
-which the Informations are filed, when
the cases were first brought to me by
order of the first judge, I refused the
motion of the Territory to bind over
witnesses to appear upon the trial,
and without deciding the question I
expressed an unfavorable impression
us regards the law under which the
informations ! were T filed, and asked
that briefs be filed. My attention was
then called to the Craig case, 20 Haw.
4S3.. The opinion, being written by
Chief Justice Robertson, holds these
statutes to be constitutional.
" Had the cases now before me gone
to completed trial upon the plea of
not guilty, this court would have been
placed In a very trying position! It is
my duty to follow the decisions of the
court of last resort In this territory,
It is alSQmy first duty, under my oath
of office, to abide by and support the
' Constitution of the United States.
On page .492 the chief justice says:
"For many years-past the succes
sive governments of these islands
have spent, and the present govern -
ment Is now spending, larga sums of
money for the purpose of attric tins
hither desirable immigrants of the
laboring and agricultural class. The
material welfare and progress of this
territory require an adequate supply
of labor. Such supply can be obtained
only from distant countries at heavy
expense to our taxpayers. The immi
grants, being generally impecunious
and sometimes very ignorant, finding
themselves among strangers in a
strange -country, are peculiarly sus
ceptible to such glittering representa
tions as. may be and perhaps often are,
held out by Irresponsible labor agents.
The legislature w as cognizant of these
conditions, and being so was fully
justified in taking any lawful steps in
its power to protect the community,
the people in it, and our local indus
tries, from the incursions of emigrant

The .measure became immediately ef

This is the bill which uncondition
ally repeals the cause in the present
tariff law under which foreign sugars
would be admitted duty free to th
United states after May 1, isi6. une
bill was amended in the senate to make
this free-sugar clause effective on May
1, 1920, but the house refused to ac
cept the amendment and the senate
receded. Therefore, the present tar
iff cn sugar will remain in effect in
definitely, the free-sugar feature be
ing knocked out by the Kitchin bill.
Since March 1, 1914, 96-degree test
foreign sugars have been paying 1.25G
cents a pound duty, and Cuban sug
ars, which enjoy a 20 jer cent prefer
ential, have been paying 1.0048 cents.
The duty is generally referred to as
"a cent a pound" because of the fact
that, it is the Cuban. Imports , which

BETTER STEAMER
SERVICE COMING
As the upshot of a conference held
this morning between the Kauai
Chamber of Commerce committee and
the board of directors of the Inter
Island regarding better steamer ser
vice between Honolulu and the Gar
den Island, the company practically
promised to put the KInau and Maui
back on their old runs within two or
three weeks, pending a further deci
sion. ':. . . " V
Another conference Is being held at
L3 o'clock this afternoon. Attending
the conference this morning were four
directors of the Inter-Island. W. O.
Smith, J. M. Dowsett, J. W. Waldron
and George JSM Wilcox. '

roughlyand although no conclusion
has been4 reached, we have promised
to give the committee's requests care

1 J. L. McLean of the Inter-Island at
boon today, following the close of this
mornings session' We showed thera
the dif acuities In the way of operat
ing the Kilaoea on the Kauai run, and
we will let them know' what we can
do just as soon as possible."
At yesterday afternoon's conference
the committee put up a strong argu
ment for placing both the Kilauea and
the Kinau on the Kauai run. ; This
was the bone of contention during the
entire time the committee was thresh
ing out transportation matters . with
officials of the Inter-Island.
"The Kinau will go back on her old
Kauai run, to Wfiimea, In two or three
weeks, unless a different decision is
reached before that time." added Mr.
McLean today, in talking over the re
sults of this morning's . conference.
"We reached no decision regarding the
Kilauea proposition." Yesterday Mr.
