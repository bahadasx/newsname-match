DIPLOMATS ARE DOING

Spee'dy Settlement
Sy United Press.
Berlin, April 27. The crisis in Ger
man-American relations is virtually
passed and there will be no Jireak in
diplomatic relations due to past
events. The United Press is able 1.0-
day to make the foregoing statement
on the moft excellent authority.
Pendingt;ie present negotiations, it
is understood that submarines will op
erate under instructions of such a na
ture as to preclude the possibility of
of a repetition of the acts complained
of by the United States government.
The danger point is believed to have
passed Monday when information con
cerning President Wilson's attitude
readied the foreign office.
Ambassador Bernstorff has been
given wide discretion and he doubt
less played a large part in guiding
matters past the crisis. The tense at
mosphere here has disappeared.
To Confer With Kaiser,

Berlin, April 27. Ambassador Ge
rard will leave for the grand army
headquarters tonight for a conference
with the kaiser. Chancellor Beth
niann von Hollvveg is now with the
kaiser but is expected to return to
morrow to prepare the reply to the
last American note.
Ambassadors Busy
By UnitePress.
Washington, April 27. Ambassa
dors Bernstorff and Gerard are doing
their utmost to avoid a breach be
tween Germany and America.
While Gerard has informed Wash
imton officials concerning the pro
gress that is being made iu negotia
tions and that some official word
from Germany will be sent by Satur
day, Bernstorff is striving to obtain
an adjustment of the differences ex
isting between the two governments.
It is believed that the activities of
the ambassadors are having a favor
able effect upon the administration
heads.
In view of the disposition of Ger
man officials to effect a settlement
of the controversy, it is believed un
likely that the president will demand
greater haste.
Press opinion in Germany is so di
vided that an accurate guage of news
paper sentiment is impossible.
Ambassador Selected.

Washington, April 2T. The presi
dent has decided upon the nomination
of Abram I. Elkus for ambassador to
Turkey, succeeding Henry Morgan-
thau, in compliance with the request
of the latter that he be relieved in
order .that he may work for the re
election of President Wilson. The
administration is inquiring - as to
whether Elkus will be satisfactory to
Turkey.
OLD CUTTER
AT AUCTION
By United Press.
San Francisco, April 27. After
bucking the ice in most of the seven
seas for thirty-five years, the coast
guard cutter Thetis is cruUing into
this port to go into the governmental
discard today by public auction.
The European war saved the Thetis
from the scrap heap. Steamship men
all over the United States await her
arrival here. They are to bid for her
when the government auctioneer an-
nounces:
"One steamship, gentlemen."
During her service the Thetis has
not been a liner and a lady. She
started out. as a Dundee whaler, a
work that requires mainly what sail
ors call "guts."
The Thetis entered the navy -in
1X83, when, commanded by then Cupt.
W. S.'Schley, she went with two other
ships, to rescue Lieut. A. W. Greeley,
afterward Major General Greeely,
from the Arctic ice. She served as a
navy survey ship on one trip carrying
a load of reindeer from Siberia to
Alaska.
The fact that she was condemned
by the navy a dozen years ago did
not interfere with her efficiency. .
Coast guard men say they would
have been lucky two years ago to get
So.Oiki for her. Now, they say, they
expect her to bring $:!0,000. She . is
expected to pay for herself on her
first trip.

DIAMOND IS

for Thief
I
The diamond ring, lifted by the
"punk" at the supposed instigation of
the professional hobo with whom he
was traveling, has been claimed by its
rightful owner.
The story of the wanderings of he
ring and of its purchase by "Sherlock
Holmes" Owsley, who later caused the
arrest of those lrom whom he obtain
ed the ring, was told in detail in yes
terday's issue f the Express.
And when the carriers went forth
to spread the glad tidings by distrib
uting the Express, throughout the
width and breadth of Chickasha, the
lady from whom the ring had been
stolen read the story. She is Mrs. C.
K. White, of Cir Minnesota avenue,
wife of C. K. White, a Rock Island
machinist.
Mr. and Mrs. White, as soon as they
had read the story of the "King mid
the Tramp." came up town and iden -
tified the ring, first, and the boy whom
they had fed and who had returned
thanks for the feed by lifting the
shiner.
Mrs. White shook hands with the
"kid" and told him how sorry she was
to know that he had stolen the ring;
she exacted a promise from him that
he would henceforth lead an honest
and an upright life and expressed the
hope that the city officials would for the troops from interference

San Antonio, Tex.,, April 27. Gen
Scott, chief of staff ot the U. S. army4
has received orders, from Washington
regarding matters which he is to dis
cuss with Gen. Ohregon, the Mexican!
war minister. , He is ready to leavo
today, for the coming confernnc -on
receipt of word concerning Obregon'sJ
destination. .
It ; is understood that the request
for early withdrawal of the U. S,
troops from Mexico may be threshed;
out indirectly through negotiations
with Obregon.
While the immediate object of, tha
conference is, as Btated, a question of,
military dispositions to end bandit op
erations along the border, there is na
doubt that its result will have a strong
influence upon the diplomatic nego
tiations between the two governments
It is considered certain that Gem
eral Obregon will tarry back to Mexi
co City on his return a definite Im
pression that the Anerican troops
will remain in the positions to whichi
General Funston is now shifting them
as a buffer between the disturbed,
area of northern Mexico and the bor
der until the success of the Carranza,
forces iu pur-suing the bandits re
moves the danger of further raids on
American towns. It also is virtually
certain that the intention off tha
American forces to police thoroughly
all the territory in the immediate vi
cinity of their advanced bases will be
made clear.
To this extent the. conference will
.elve General Carranza advance notice
or the attitude the United States will
take in replying to his note of April
12 suggesting the withdrawal of tha
forces. Officials hope, however, that
its more immediate result will be to
clear away the misunderstanding and
suspicion with which the movements
of American troops have been regard-,
ed by local Mexican commanders and
officials; to free supply shipments)
, early withdrawal of the American
forces from Mexico 'would be to lend
all possible aid in the chase for the
bandits. Wli his elimination either
by American or Mer.ican troops, it id
believed the Washington government
would agree to an immediate retire
ment of the expedition across the bor
der. It would be made clear in this)
connection that United States offi
cials have no donbt of their ability to
capture the bandit were it not fop
their desire to avoid clashes with tha
Mexicans such as occurred at Parral,
The redisposition of the troops to con
fine their operations to a more limit
ed field since that incident will bn
j cited as evidence of the good faith o$
the statement.
