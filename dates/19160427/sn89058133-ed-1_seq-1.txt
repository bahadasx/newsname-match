"Veterans first."
This is the slogan that has been
adopted by the entertainment com
mittee of Birmingham, Alabama,
for the forthcoming reunion of the
Confederate Veterans to be held in
Birmingham May 16-17-18. The vet
erans that bared their breasts to the
cannons'- merciless fire during the late
unpleasantness will be cared for above
all other considerations. ' Everything
has been planned and all other propo
sitions set aside In order that the Bir
mingham reunion, which may be the
last ever held here, will go down in
history as one wherein everyone ex
hibited the keenest interest and care
of the heroes of 1860-65.
The committees in charge of the re
union have progressed admirably with
their work. Only the barest details
remain to be lined out to make the
Birmingham gathering memorable 'in
the history of Confederate reunions.
The hospitality of 1908, when Birming
ham welcomed the Confederate hosts,
will be greatly excelled by the char
acter of the hospitality and the
warmth of greetings to be offered the
veterans' in May.
Through the kindness of the govern
ment of the United States the commit,
