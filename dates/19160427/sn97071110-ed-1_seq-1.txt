BOND ELECTION '
DRAWSMEREST
VOTE ON SCHOOL ISSUE ON FRIDAY
While Some Citizens Call Expenditure of
$45,000 Eitrmgance, Board .
' Calls it Economy
" State and eounty polities will be for
gotten by eitiiens of Hood ' River this
week, all interest being centered in
the school bond election of tomorrow
afternoon,' when qualified electors will
vote on the proposed bond issue of $45,
000. of which the school' board, P. A.
Cram. Mrs. Alma Howe and Dr. C H.
Jenkins, will sell so much as is neces
ssry for tne construction of an addi
tional high school structure on prop
erty just south ef the present high
school building and for the erection of
one atory grade school on Eugene
street property, provided the issue car
ries. While the bond issue will not by
any means be carried by a unanimous
vote, the members of the board, all of
whom declare the movement one of
strict economy, have been conducting
aeampaign or information that 'bis
been - making supporters of electors
formerly indifferent, but open to argu
ment v
Explaining bow the money at pres
ent in the school treasury and that to
be obtained by the proposed bond Issue
win be spent. Mr. Uram. who Is chair
man of the board, says :
A portion of the lund on hand.
amounting to about $11,000, will be
used in purchasing sites, the1 balance
for incidental expensea. The board
has options' on lots on Eugene street for
the proposed site of the new grade
building, and a block just south of the
high school for the high school build-'
Ing.
'While we have made the bond issue
for $45,000. because of the present
fluctuating values of materials, we con
template selling only so much of the
issue as is absoutely necessary for the
work proposed. The building we have
planned for the Eugene street site will
be one story in height and of four
rooms. It will provide a place for the
segregation of the smaller children
and will relieve the overcrowded condi
tion of the Park street school. i The
building will be so constructed that an
other story may be added when needed.
flumbing fixtures will be installed, so
thst connections can be made without
an additional expense. We propose to
expend between $16,000 and $18,000 on
tbia building. I he contsruction of this 1
building will keen the younger children
of the district away from the stronger i
and rougher ones of the higher gradea.
On the proposed new high school
building, which will provide adequate
accommodations for a domestic scienee
department, manual training and gym
naaium laciiiies, we propose to spend
from $25,000 to $30,000. We propose to
remove the beating plant of the high
school to the new Eugene street struc
ture, selling one furnace to The Dalles.
The existing high school structure and
the new building, which will be sfmiair
in outer architectural design but on
modern plans in arrangement, will be
heated from a modem central beating
plant." . !
Mr. cram states that the cost or run
ning the high achool is practically as
great with only the attendance of the
students whose parents reside in the
city district, as with the increased at
tendance from neighboring rural dis
tricts, the boards ef which under exist
ing arrangements are sending their stu
dents of high school grades to town,
paying an annual sum of $4,800 for
their tuition.
"This sum." says Mr. Cram, "is
probably at minimum, for the outside
attendance will prboably be increased
if the additional school facilities are
provided."
Members of the school boards of
Pine Grove, Frankton and Barrett dis
trict met with the local board last
week, and it was the concensus of
opinion as expressed that the rural dis
tricts would continue to send the high
school grades to town, provided they
are given the accommodation of the
additional building. The rural parents
feel that the local high school authori
ties have done their best this year, but
they think the changes should be
effected and better facilities provided.
In case the bond election fails, it is
likely that the students of the country
districts will drop out of the local
school.
"The country people feel." says Mr.
Cram, "that for the $60 they pay us
annually for each student we can do
far more for their children than they
could by establishing any high schools
of their own. And as was expressed at
Our meeting last week, we are going to
continue to get their support, if we
produce the goods. Our proposed plans
will effect an economy for them and at
the same time give us a saving. The
$4,800 we get from them would pay
interest, at eve per cent, on a latMHX)
ond issue. We feel sure thst we can
sell the bonds at five per cent, and get
a nice premium. We are only asking
for S45.000. v
"If we lose the country students we
sre going to have to raise by taxation
this $4,800 that we have been getting
from them for tuition ; for the expensea
of the school is are going to remain
practically the same. Keally.it will
cost us more money for school taxea
next year if we do not bond than it we
do bond.
Dr. C. H. Jenkins save:
"As a director in this district I have
been asked my reasons for advocating
bond issue lor $4&,wu.
"First we lack room in our buildings
to accommodae our children and have
been paying outside rental for two
years. At present some of our rooms
are so over-crowdea mat pupua ao noi
receive as much personal attention
from the teacher aa tbey should. This
results in loiter standings. Nor is the
crowding of pupils satisfactory from a
sanitary standpoint We need more
room and this csn only be obtained by
renting or' building. If we rent our
taxea must be increased and at the end
of the vear there la nothing to show
for the expenditure. If we build
permanent structures, tbey will last
long after the bondalhave been retired
and we'have something to show for our
investment, uood schools attract gooo
people to our community and are the
beat advertisements of our social and
commercial etanding. Our boys and
girls are our future citizens. What
better investment can we make for
them?
"Jhe bond issue called for is $45,000;
yearly interest on same, $2250. ' Out
side rentals $625. If we do not build
this year that amount Will be doubled.
We receive $4800 from outside tuition.
If we canjiold that amount and aavo
approximately $1200 .on rentals,' that
means a total saving to our taxpayers
of $6000 per year.' Deduct $2250 for
interest on bonds and you.have.$3750
to apply yearly on the bond' iasue. In
20 years that wooldlamount to $75,000.
Our bond iasue calls for $45,000. Why
not have the buildings and let them
pay for themselves?" ,
Ssys Prof. J. O. McLaughlin:
"This is an important iasue. If steps
are not taken this year to provide addi
tional room the schools can hardly be
held at their present efficiency, and we
ought to do better work each year.
Both the gradea and the high achool
must be tsken care of. Each is aa im
portant and- needy as the other. The
school enrollment bss increased each
year even in theae times. The school
board and the various committees have
spent much time in studying these .con
ditions and I ' believe that they have
arrived at the best plan of meeting our
needs and if the taxpayers will study
the situstion one-tenth aa long, they
will support the board.
"Beyond our actual needs. I am also
a firm believer in the future of Hood
River. ' This northwest is now an agri
cultural section, but the waterpower
will make it a second Mew England in
manufacturing. In natural endowments
Hood River is second to none. ' If any
one has lost faith in onr future, let him
visit other ' Sections of ' the United
States." While providing for present
needs, th school board has always kept
th future in mind.
"I have also a greet deal of faith In
the good people of Hood River. They
have always supported the schools well
and will do so ibis time if they under
stand the teal aituation. The only ob
jection I have heard is the one of tsx
ea, and that is easy to meet this time.
Every opponent I have talked with has
not aeen the flgares in this issue."
Mrs. Alms Howe Bavs:
'"Were I to answer the auestion in a
few- words, why I favor the bond issue
of $45,000, If would be that we need
more room. - better equipment and a
segregstion of the pupils. - Especially
to get the primary gradea removed
from the older ones: also to get the
frades from the high achool pupils,
he latter condition has long bees re
gretted by the board and the instruct
ors as well as' by the parents. Tney
sre at an age that la hard to eontrol at
beat and this condition does not help
any.
"As we stl know. Park street school
has "Been overcrowded for years with
too heavy classes, as well as being a
dangerous place.' Especially is it so
for little folks: By taking them to a
separate location where they have only
one atreet instead of three, as at Park
street, those coming from above can
come at an easy grade.
I he tour rooms for the primary pu
pils will relieve the grades until such a
time as an up-to-date school can be
built for Park.
Aa to the high school, it is well
known how inadequate the facilities are
there and if we want to hold and in
crease our income from all outside
sources, we must prepare for them.
we reel that we are asking only for
what we need, both In land and build
ings, to csrry on a school that will be
worthy of our wonderful country.whicb
is attracting so many people of educa
tion and talent to become one of us.
J The world is divided into classes, the
T'Lifters" and the "Learners." Come
on Friday, April 28, at 2 p.m., at Park
street school, and be a "Lifter."
The most convincing argument in op
position to the bond issue is advsnced
by E. L. Smith, who says :
"taxation, as was shown iust a day
or two ago at the State Tax League in
session in Portland, will eventually lead
to confiscation or property, if it is not
stopped. At this league meeting it
was shown that up in Umatilla county
taxation' has increased more than 400
per cent in ten yearsa. Oregon's taxea
have become the highest of any state
in the Union.
"Now with regard to school needs
and taxes. - Let us look at the State
Normal School. '' In former days, when
the buildings were smsll the Institution
had an attendance of 600. With a mul
tiplicity of buildings the attendance
has dwindled to 260. This shows that
an Increased number of buildings does
not mean an increased number of stu
dents, according to estimates made at
the above mentioned tax meeting.
'"Conditions in Hood River have
changed since the time when we voted
school bond issue of $43,000, Then
the song of the saw and hammer was
heard over the town. Today thev are
rusting in the tool chests of builders.
Then our population wss Increasing.
Today people are moving away from
Hood River in numbers.
"Let us consider our present bond
interest, the sums of which must be
annually raised by taxation. ' On the
outstanding $43,000 school bonds we
are paying annually, at 6i per cent,
$2,415. On our Columbia river high
way bond issue of $75,000, in addition
to paying each year a sum lor a sink
ing fund w must raise by taxation the
interest charge of approximately $900 ;
for in school district No. 3. It must be
remembered, is approximately one-fifth
of the entire assessable property of the
eounty. lo these figures must be added
varioua other taxea for special road
fund, a library fund bf approximately
$1,000 per annum. Can we afford to
add to these existing burdens that of
the interest on the proposed $45,000
school bonder
Our school board members are tell
ing as that nothing more than schools
will make our city a desirable home lo
cation. Will anything ao repel settle'
ment and investment as a heavy bond
ed indebtedness?
I hsve heard a great deal of talk
about the loss of this $4,800 which is
paid as tuition to our city district by
country students. Let me ask if this
sum has been profit. Hsve we not
furnished these children their educa
tion at cost? Have we made anything
by it? If new buildings are going to
be constructed, should not these coun
try districts pay their pro rata portion
or the coat, to be consistently rain
"Our newspapers and banks are tell
ing us thst there is a wave of prosper
ity sweeping westward. It seems to
me that It would be well to delay this
proposed bonded indebtednes until af
ter it has rescued school district no. a.
"It is not convenient for the country
districts to send their pupils to the city
because of the distsnca and lack of
transportation facilities. Eventually
the rural districts will build high
Bchools of their own. 1 have been told
that the Odell school board haa been
making a selection of the site of a pro

EARLYPIONEER
QVIL WAR SERVICE IS RECORDED
Natires of Indiana, Mr. Wilson and Bis
Family Came to Oregon by Way
Of California in 1876
Among the early pioneera of the
Hood River valley, are Mr. and Mrs.
John A. Wilson, whose home ie on
Seventh street. Mr. and Mra. Wilson
arrived in Oregon from Illinois in 1876.
coming by way of the Union Pacific
line to ban Francisco, and thence by
boat to Portland. The tourney from
Omaha to Sacramento consumed eight
dsys.
Mr. Wilson took up a homestead in
the district, known at the time aa the
Belmont district, but which is now
considered a part of the Barrett dis
trict At the time or hia arrival there
waa but one achool in the community.
It waa conducted in a little frame
atructure that now forms the kitchen
at the Cottage Farm resort of Mrs.
Alma Howe. The achool was tsuhgt by
Mrs. Mary Henderson, mother of Prof.
L. F. and John Leland Henderson.
The next sear after the arrival of
Mr. Wilson the Barrett school district
was formed, Mr. Wilson. Newton Clark
and V. Hxlge being.the first directors.
Dr. r. u. Barrett waa clerk or the
district. Mr. Wilson served on the
board for nine successive years.
Mr. Wilson s plsce a number of yeara
ago was purchased by H. R. Albee,
now msyor of Portland. Mr. Albee
aubdivided the tract and reaold it A
portion of the homestead ia at present
owned by S. G. Oxborrow.
"Newton Clark," says Mr. Wilson,
when he was on his way to the ahingle
eamp near Parkertown, stopped at my
place and inquired the way.
Mr. Wilson is a native or Indiana,
while hia wife waa born in Ohio. Their
wedding occurred in Livingstone coun
ty, HI., in February, 1869. Mrs. Wil
son s maiden name waa iMancy A.
Chamberlin.
On May 21 Mr. Wilson will have
reached hia 75th birthday, having been
born in 1841 in Fayette county, near
Connersville, Ind.
In 1852 Mr. Wilson moved with his
parents to Wabash county, where he
resided on a farm until the outbreak of
the Civil war, when he enlisted on Ap
ril 23, 1861. with the Eighth Indiana
Volunteers for a 90 day service. When
this enlistment wss up he became a.
member of tbe 46th Indiana Volunteera
for a three year service, or so long aa
the war should last.
During the first 90 days Mr. Wilson
saw active service in West Virginia,
and on July 11, 1861, participated hi
the battle of Rich Mountain. .
With the 46th Volunteers he marched
through Kentucky and thence to New
Madrid, Mo., which waa taken by Fed
eral forcea during March, 1862. From
New - Madrid be went to rort Pillow.
80 miles above Memphis. After the
evacuation of Corinth his regiment
went to Memphis on a gunboat fleet.
Mr. Wilson wss at Memphis the day
the city was taken in June, 1862. Tbe
regiment was then sent on an expedi
tion up White River, Arkansas, with
supplies for Curtis' army, which waa
at Batesville. Low water, however,
prevented the relief expedition from
resulting successfully.- The regiment
then returned to Helena, Ark.
Mr. ' W ilson and his fellow comrades
in the spring- of 1863 were sent to
Vicksburg. A battle engaged them on
ay 1 at Port Uibson, and on May lb
the battle of Champion Hill waa

1684 went on the Red river expedition.
On April 8, 1864, Mr. Wilson was cap
tured by the Confederate forces at Sa
bine Crossroads. He waa in prison for
eight months, four 'months at Tyler,
Tex., and four at Hempstead. After
his release he did garrison duty until
he was mustered out on September 4,
1865.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson have the fol
