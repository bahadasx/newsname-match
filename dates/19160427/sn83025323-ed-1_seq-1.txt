cent of th.o'flcial regsistration :

thing great. The total vote for the

tant offices was as follows:

MALTA SCHOOL NOTES. t
The class play will be given to
morrow night, April 28. The cast
is good and the play is clever. The
The players have been training dili
gently so that they are prepared to
give a good account of themselves.
The p.oceeds will be used to defray
the Comniencement expenses or 'un
class of 1916. The plaie'is the -Bi
son. Don't forget! ".,-- "
The school moviesf tare going to be
a sUicOess. They are being given this
afternoon. Paul Revere's Ride is
the chief picture. Parents and
friends are cordially invited to at
tend the showing of these films.
Definite arrangements have been
made for a triangular track and,
field meet at Glasgow, May 6th.
Culbertson, Glasgow and Malta will
compete. Liberal prises -are being
offered by the Glasgow people. The
Malta boys are going down with the
intention of winning. It would be
fine to have agoodly bunch of root
ers along to inspire the boys.
Commencement plans are ,well un
der way. The regular Commence
ment program will be rendered by
the graduating class with the assist
ance of some of the townspeopel.
who render the musical portion of
the program. Commencement will
occur on May 19 at the Bison thea
tre. In addition to the Commence
ment exercises, a baccaulaurate
sermon will be delivered at the M.
E. church, Sunday, May 14, at 8:00
p. m., Rev. Cookingham has been
elected by the class to deliver the
address.
On. Friday, May 12, it is the pur
pose of the grade pupils to stage a
unique entertainment for our school.
An outdoor program is being ar
ranged. All the grades up to the
eighth will have part. It will be
given at the school grounds, using
the concrete platform at the rear of
the building as a stage. This enter
tainment will take the place of the
closing exercises in the separate
rooms. Please plan too come. It
will be held in the afternoon at 2:30.
It is the aim of the school trustees
to place the -Malta High School on
the a'oredited list as saoon as popsi
ble. This is an aim worthy of the
c ooperation of all. The trustees
are starting right, by setting a high
standard of scholarship and experi
ence for newly elected teachers.
These must be either college or nor
mal graduates both in the high
school and in the grades, for the in
spection must cover both high
school and grades. No matter how
good an equipment, how many or
how good teachers there are in the
high school, if the grades are not
strong we will not secure recogition.
Having secured the right sort of
teachers, two conditions will have
been filled-you will have a good
school house and a good teaching
staff. But there is more. No matter
: how good the equipment or how able
the teachers the scholars must be
a here all the year. Many drop out at
this time of year. Some continue
their studies at home or in some
country school, but that does nol
help the record of our school. Pupilb
and parents are instrumental it
securing the placing of a school or
a the accredited list. Pupils must nol
only be regular in attendance, bul
p they must be real students. Parenti
n can assist by trying to make it pos
sible to keep the bdy of the girl it
o the school. All these responsibili
ties will be taken care of if we al
look forward in the same spirit
blaming no one because we are no'
w on the accredited list yet, and seek
ing to put the school in such condi
' tion that it will stand the state in
I spection.
SCHrII0 MOVING PICTURES
To tl 1..,fie ds and Patrons of the
MaltS Chqol:
Fot spn.S e time there has been
muo~i ~pi as to the possibility of
using juPi ing pictures for instruco
tion. pt@ol people have pondered
the mSat and in the small towns
ways o;tgi. uring the pictures have
preseft & problem. However the
solutlo4-.,a7y have been reached
through ;die agency of the Missouri
Valley -ilm Co., which places sets
of fllm.i at the disposal of schools at
a nonin price.
Thre eeools of the Milk River
Valley., La vre, Chinook and Malta,
have f0rWe d a circuit to secure
films onae ekch week. Locally the
films wiir be shown through the
kindness 'af the Orpheum manage
ment. As- announced in dodgers,
circulated last week, these shows will
be given every Thursday at 4 p. m.
Not only the children, but the par
ents and' friends are invited to at
tend. " To the child we hope to give
instruction tend wholesome enter
tainment. To the adult we would
not only give these, but also the
knowledge of what we are trying to
do in school.
The price of admission is as small
as it could be made. The proceeds
are to be divided,the school's portion
to be used in equipping the play
grounds at the new school, so that
when school reopens in the fall the
swings, teeters and other apparatus
will be ready for use.
We desire your hearty cooperation
not only in attending the display of
films, but by the kindly word of en
couragement, which will enthuse
others in this project.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN L. ELLIOTT.
ALDER GULCH IN LIMELIGHT
Word has just reached Malta from
the Little Rockies that a big strike
has been made at that point. The
new find is in old Alder gulch, two
miles up the hill from ortman, where
considerable placer mining has been
going on for some time past. The
names of the lucky ones who were
fortunate in discovering the hidden
fortune are W. H. Pennington and
Ed. Meyers. This \gives evidence
that there i. untold riches in the
lills in the Attl Rockies Mining
territory. ..
Walter Stutmnan is in from the
mountains today attending to some

Triangle plays at the Bison are
increasingly popular with every ap
pearance. "Let Katy Do It" Tues
