Lansing, Kan., April 27.
Mutterings against Fred Bissell,
alleged slayer of Edna Dinsmore,
are becoming more insistent
each hour and Warden Codding
has doubled his guards in the cell
house where Bissell is being COn- j
fined in a solitary cell.
During the noon hour, while
the men were at dinner, Bissell
was removed to the warden's of
fice, which is outside of the pris
on walls and is separated from
tha prisoners by two heavy iron
doors and an armed guard. How
ever, there was no demonstra
tion. Driven to a frenzy by the story
of the brutal assault and murder
of Edna Dinsmore at Topeka,
convicts at the state prison here
this morning attempted to enact
the same revenge planned by To
peka residents.
Use of Clubs.
It was only by the use of clubs
in the hands of Deputy Warden
Lindsey and a corps of prison
guards that a mob formed in the
"bull pen ot the prison was
driven away from the door of a
cell house in which Fred Bissell,
accused murderer of the Dins
more girl, was confined in an iso
lated cell.
Hardly had the prisoners
learned that Bissell had entered
the prison at midnight than
threats were heard on all sides
against his life. An extra guard
was thrown into the "bull pen"
where the men are lined up, pre
paratory for breakfast and
work.
"Let's get the . We'll
finish the job for Topeka," were
some of the remarks heard.
Suddenly one convict in line
raised his hand and shouted just
before they marched into the
breakfast room.
"1 'ome on. boys, let's do it now."
('tabbed Them Off.
The line began to surge and the
guards with clubs swinging rushed
among Ihe convicts, quickly singling
"nt the man who had incited the men,
grabbed him and dragged the fellow
to an isolated cell.
Threats and pleadings of the offi
cers finally availed and the men were
quieted and hurried into the break
fast room at the mess hall.

Mayor House Will
Call Militia Out
To Protect Bissell
' long as I am mayor of To
pekn I never want to see mob vio
lence oeenr in Topeka and will lo
all In my power to avoid it,' said
Mayor House tbis morning, l ast
nJgnfl about 9: 10 I called tlie sher
iff off Lawrence on the long dis
tance 'phone and notified him
that a mob from Toeka was on
its way to take Bissell from him
but he assured me that Bissell was
then on Ills way to I, aiming and
I felt greatly relieved."
"What a-ltout his return for
trial, do you think sentiment will
have cooled down sufficiently by
that time so there will le no dan
cer?" he was asked.
"For a crime like this people
never fully m1 off and there will
Ik danger but when Bissell re
turns for trial we will have the
nihil la called out to guard him
and f will see that this is done."
Another city commissioner who
was present when the mayor was
talking said: "You're mighty
right. Sentiment will not cool
down about this affair for no
father with a little child will ever
I lie able to forget it. and I don't
really believe It will ever be safe
for Bissell to be brought back to
Topeka for trial unless he is
strongly guarded."
"Wt will see to that end of it
when he Is brought back." said
the major.
CAPPER HELD IT UP
Governor Would Not Sign Pa
pers to Revoke Citizenship.
Fears Action Would Be Taken
as Presumption of Guilt.
After formal notices revoking the
I citizenship papers of Fred Rissell had
heen prepared today. Governor Capper
declined to sign the documents. The
action would have meant Bissell's re
tention at the state penitentiary un
der old charges until the state was
ready to try the man in Topeka for
the murder of 9 year old Kdna Dins
more. Risseil's freedom at the time
of the triple offense of assault, mur
der and arson, was due to a parole by
the state board of corrections and the
subsequent issuance of citizenship pa
pers by the governor.
Bissell's freedom in view of his un
usual prison record and alleged inhu
man crimes, has been a puzzle to hun
dreds of Topeka people. His release
from the state penitentiary nineteen
months in advance of his minimum

Kan.,
April 27. That J. H. Rinehart, coro
ner of Shawnee county, second in au
thority to the sheriff, was a ring lead
er of the Topeka mob, that stormed
the jail at Lawrence last night, was
the statement made by Sheriff Cum
mings of Douglas county, to Sheriff L.
L. Kiene by telephone this morning.
Rinehart stated, said Cummings.
over the telephone, that any man
who would try to protect a man like
Bissell deserved to have his own
daughter treated like little Edna Dins
more was treated.
Kiene was dumbfounded by the in
formation. "Why that man is sworn to enforce
the law the same as I am," he said.
"The coroner is the only official who
can arrest a sheriff if he should go
wrong."
Kiene declared that he would make
an immediate investigation upon his
return to Topeka and that he would
ask for warrants for the ring leaders
in the mob- He declared Shawnee
county had no need, as an officer, of
a man who would lead a mob and in
cite to mob violence. Sheriff Kiene
is deeply affected by developments in
Topeka, since he left last night, and
asked that the State Journal make
the following statement for him:
Kleno's Statement.
"T am not so much interested in
the life of Bissell as in protecting
the good name of Kansas and To
peka. So long as I am an offi
cer of Shawnee county and the
state of Kansas, no man will be
lynched who is under my protec
tion, if it Is possible for me to pre
vent It. Let this be made per
fectly clear. Bissell has not con
fessed and is just as vehement in
denying his connection with this
horrible crime as he was when
first taken Into custody.
"There are circumstances that
indicate he may not be the guilty
man. though I firmly believe he
is guilty of such an outrage, but
the law says he is entitled to a
fair trial and he is going to get it
if we can secure it for htm. I have
been told that at least one county
officer charged with the enforce
ment of the law took a leading
part in last night's demonstration
and made threats against me, per
sonally, for doing my sworn duty.
"I intend upon my return to
Topeka to make a thorough inves
tigation and I shall ask for war
rants for him and the other lead
ers. I do not believe that Shaw
nee county or the state of Kansas
has any need of that kind of of
ficer. "No one can deplore this hor
rible crime more than myself for
I have young children of my own
but we cannot bring back to life
the innocent victim of this In
human monster, whoever he ts,
and T shall do all In my power to
protect this prisoner and see that
the dignity of the law is upheld.
"The people should have the
same degree of confidence that
they will do absolute justice to
any one charged with crime as I
myself have. The people them
selves cannot afford to do any
thing to prevent the administra
tion of justice."
Rinehart Denies It.

London. April 27. News published

much damage was done by the four
Zeppelins which visited Kent and Es

bombs were dropped by the raiders
there were no casualties.
From the town when they reached
the British coast the airships were
kept under the beams of searchlights
and subjected to a very heavy bom
bardment of anti-aircraft guns, forc
ing them to rise to a great height and
to return across the North sea.
Tn a. straight run of two miles across
one part of Esex a dozen bombs were
dropped, mostly in fields, while six
bombs fell in the neighborhood of a
farm house without doing any dam
age except to crops.
There were many narrow escapes,
however, in Kent. Bombs dropped L
around the village. The only one th.it
did any damage fell in the garden of
a vicarage, uprooting a large tree
which struck the clerical residence.
Crowds everywhere watched the flight

Berlin. April 27. ( By wireless to

says a report has been published in the
Dutch newspaper De Tribune, that the
British sank a Dutch warship several
weeks ago. The crew was sent to
India to conceal news of he affair
and Great Britain promised to pay
damages.
The news agency statement follows:
"The Nieuw Rotterdamsche Courant

"The Dutch newspaper De Tribune
now says: The situation on March
3 1 was critical, because the British
had sunk a Dutch warship. The crew
of the man-of-war was sent to India
in order to conceal the event and
Great Britain promised to pay all
damages.'
"De Tribune says this report came
from a member of the crew of the
Bredau. The political situation .was
cleared immediately after satisfactory
declarations were made by the British,
who apologized and promised to pay
immediate Indemnities "
Incident Caused War Flurry.
The recent crisis in Holland when
troops were mobilized and prepara
tions made for war was due to the
fact that the British had sunk a Dutch
warship, according to reports brought
here today.
This fact was concealed from the
Dutch public and the incident was
closed after England offered a suitable
apology and bad promised indemnity.
