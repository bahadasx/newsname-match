Columbus, N. St., April 27. A story
of the accident In the mountains of
Chihuahua to the aeroplane of Lieu
tenant H. A. Dargue rid Captain K.
H. Willis and the subsequent trip of
the pilot and observers to the ex
peditionary field 1)086 it as brought to
the border by aviators Wednesday.
For 45 hours, half crazed by their
Injuries and hardships, the men
marched over two mountain ranges
and through a desert country Infested
with Villa's men.
At 5 a. m., April 19, the aviators
rose through a thick fog bank on a
special scouting expedition- After
flying through the passes and rock
defiles In the Sierre Madre mountains
for four hours they found themselves
confronted by a jagged mountain peak
rising sheer before them. Unable to
develop sufficient engine power to
overcome the peculiar air currents
and unable to land because of the na
ture of the terrain they threw their
plane forward in the air time after
time as a swimmer attempts to breast
the wares, in a vain attempt to climb
the peak.
Suddenly a propeller stopped and
the machine fell, crumpling Its left
wing and burying the two fliers in the
mountain side. How long they re
mained that way the men do not
know. Finally they extricated them
selves and found that their Injuries
were quite painful but were minor.
With nothing but emergency raUons
taken from the wrecked plane and a
few swallows of water the . airmen
after burning their plane, started for
the American camp. They walked all
day and all night, all the next day
and well into the next night Another
day dawned. Under the heat of the
sun their tongues began to blacken
and their feet ached and throbbed.
Through the baffling mountain passes
they made their way, avoiding VUllsta
infested villages.
After 45 hours the filers came into
the American advanced field base.
Here their wounds were treated and
their reports for It was to make re
ports they were sent were delivered.
Captain Willis, whose bumeuia
Baltimore, and Lieutenant Dargue,
who balls from illdgewood, N. J, art
rived here late today in motor cars.
Captain Willis wore a white bandage
about his head and walked with a
slight limp. Medical officers said his
condition Is not serious. With the ex
ception of an injured foot. Lieutenant
Dargue had nearly recovered.
