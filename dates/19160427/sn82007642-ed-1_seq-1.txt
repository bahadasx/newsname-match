he to attempt a sketch of every
citizen of thw county attaining a
good old age, it would require 52
numbers of The Democrat a year
in which to print the sketches, so
he feels it necessary to confine
these hietriettes to those citizens
who helped make our county his
tory and of those only the ones
, he has known during his thirteen
years residence within the bor
ders. Hugh Alexander Dobbin, Sr.,
was born of noble parents in Row
an county, N.C., August 23 1815,
and was an intelligent and ener
getic young man whoseengaging
personality won for him many
friends and admirers and through
his ardent search for knowledge
became an accomplished scholar,
bis exemplary thrift and close at
tention to business and winning
manners gaining for him a good

In 1849 Mr. Dobbin married
Miss Margaret M. Lippard of
Rowan, and in a few months
tnereaiver uiuveu w nomuso,
then Ashe county, where he pur
chased a large tract of land situ
ated on Pine Orchard and Bald
Mountain near Elk Cross Roads,
afterwards Todd, now Elkland.
where he took up his former bus
iness of selling general merchan
dise, succeeding in his venture,
considering the disadvantages
of primitive modes of transpor
tation and the sparsely settled
country thereabout, the home
. steads ten miles apart and Fay
etteville the nearest town where
goods could be bought at whole
sale! During the Ciyil War Mr.
Dobbin's store was robbed and
burned by the bushwhackers
"men who did not fight on either
side but lay out and plundered
and robbed the community for
their living," to quote from a let
ter from Mr. Dobbin's son, A. H.,
; so that between the "varmints"
in the woods and the "whackers"
in the roads, the early settlers
bad a bard time making a crop
. and keeping it.
When Mr. Dobbin moved to
- Watauea.there were few roads
across the Blue Ridge, mer
trails and they almost im passa
ble, the common way up a branch
to its source on the mountain
side, across the ridge to another
branch and up or down as the

this not done until after the
"passing away" of the brave old
pioneer on the 13th of July, 1903,
Mrs. Dobbin surviving him but
ten years; born on the 11th day
of December, 1827 and 'passed
to her reward" on the 28th Dec.
913, a noble and good woman
whose children "rise and call her
blessed."
To this honored couple were
born nine children, but four liv
ing to adult age. Laura M. who
married Charles Hulcher, three
children born of this union; Nim-
rod M. who married Miss Mary
Hardin, four children born of
this union; Hugh A. Jr.. who
married Miss Emma Miller, six
children born of this union, and
Annie who married Willett S.
Miller, five children born of this
union.
Mr. and Mrs. Dobbin's home
was known far and wide for its
open hospitality and and every
one who come, rich and poor,
high and low, fared alike and re
ceived a hearty welcome, Mr.
Dobbin ever the genial host in
telligent adviser and true friend,
Mrs. Dobbin always concerned
about the welfare of her guests
whom she made to feel at home,
while in the community she was
everybody's friend, medical advi
ser and trained nurse of unusual
skill and ability, an oracle, con
sulted on all topics of country
ife, whether on the subject of
country life, whether on the sub-
ect of of farming or schooling or
the care of children and the best
herbs and nature, remedies, and
when she passed away the com
munity lost notonly a true friend
but an example of what a Chris
tian woman can do in a commu
nity for Christ and the church of
her choice; this noble couple and
all their children devoted and
consistent members of the Pro
testant Episcopal Church, Mr. H.
A. Dobbin an honored minister
thereof. .
Again quoting from Rev. U. A.
Dobbin, your correspondent clos
es this imperfect sketch of as no
ble a couple as ever crossed the
Blue Ridge: "During and after
the war, on account of remote
ness and inaccessability and the
havoc and depredations conse
quent during those stirring times
this family and other pioneers
had a hard struggle but with un
wonted fortitude they bravely
aced all obstacles and opened
the way for a more enlightened
civilization.
No one save these sturdy and
honest pioneers will know the
hardships and deprivations that
have been endured in blazing the
way for civilization!" , All honor
to all such, say I, and let us in-
dellibly impress the fact upon
our minds, we of a later and less
interesting generation let us re.
cord their self-sacrifice and heroic
life, lest we forget how much we
owe them for "blazing the trail

Voti oi Four AmendraeBts.
The fates of four new amend
ments proposed to the constitu
tion of North Carolina will rest
with' the people of the State in
the fall of the present year.
The amendments now in t h e
balance, or soon to be, would pro
vide (1) for judges by appoint
ment of the governor in emerg
encies. That is the chief executive
of the state could telegeaph a lo
cal lawyer of good standing to
go kon the bench, with his own
case eliminated from the calen
dar, in the event of the necessity
for a special term of court when
a regular judge was not readily
available. The second amend
ment proposed would prevent the
issuance of legislative charters to
corporations. At the present time
the bulk of the commercial char
ters are issued by the secretary
of state, but persons with, some
special corporation planned of
ten go before the general assem
bly and secure by special legisla
tion a charter which allows cer
tain privileges which the general
aws would not prove.
It has pointed out that there
have been times when charters
were thus issued by the legisla
ture for tax immune corpora
tions or for corporations with
condemnation powers toward
laud and property which the gen
eral laws in equity would not en
dorse. The third amendment propos
ed would provide for the incorpo
ration of towns by the secretary
of state and prevent their char
tering in the legislature. This
would compel the issuance of in
corporation papers to towns and
cities oi a petition of a certain
percentage of tbe qualified voters
of the towns in question and the
incorporation would be under the
incorporation would be under
the general law. The fourth a-
mendmendment would prevent
"local" legislation in the gener
al assembly; namely, such legis
lation concerning hunting, throw
ing sawdust into creeks" or han
dling the road buildingquestions,
which might be handled by the
boards of county commissioners.
The amendments are framed
in each instance to expedite mat
ters and to provide system where
chaos exists, according to the
proposition. The provision for
the emergency judge which is sug
gested is already operative in
South Carolina and is declared
to be economical, expedient and
satisfactory. Proposed amend
ment number 2 is claimed to have
as its reason for raising its head,
the safeguarding of the state from
predatory commerce or special
privilege business, which might
find its way through the chan
nels of a busy or ill-informed leg
islature, and to save the time of
the legislators from the burdens
of the minutiae counected with
the investigation of such cases.
Three and four of the amend
ments are alleged time savers, al
though it is arguedifor the amend
ment which which would reduce
the amount of "local" legisla
tion in the general assembly, that
it is in keeping with the best in
democratic government; to wit,
the principle of the prevalence of
vox popll. This is asserted on the
base of the contention that a leg
islator might put through an un
interested or unawakened legis
lature a provision for his home
county which would bedetestible
to his owu constituency, whereas
when those things are handled
by the county commissioners,
thery are threshed out among
friends and foes alike. Lexing

Germany's Move.
Charlotte Observer, April, 20.
The issue now rests with Ger
many. It is for the Imperial Gov
ernment to say what shall be its
future relations with the United
States. Congress has not acted,
nor has it need to act.. All that
has been done thus far lies whol
ly within the domain of the Ex
ecutive. His was the duty to
plumb the line of international
law, his was the responsibility to
outline the attitude of the Gov
ernment of the United States.
How. faithfully he has faced that
duty, how' courageously he has
measured up to that responsibil
ity all the world knows. It is em
phatically true that the people
of the United States do not want
war. It is undoubtedly true that
many of them do not think a
technical dispute is a sufficient
cause for mortal combat. That,
however, is not the question now.
Amid the bedlam of voices, amid
the confusion of diuided counsels,
it was the pre-eminent preroga
tive of one mind to grapple with
this problem and to Jpoint the
way to America's duty. When
that pathway was once defined,
it must be followed, however per
ilous it might be. So far as pos
sible, the policy of this nation 1ms
been pacific. If armed conflict re
sults from the present situation
it will not be from any overt act
committed by the Government.
Had it deemed war the proper so
lution it would have begun it on
May 8, 1915, on the day after
the Lusitama was sent to the
bottom with the loss of more
than 100 American lives, includ
ing many women and many chil
dren Had it deemed war the
proper solution, the Executive
would yesterday have urged Con
gress to fling down the gage of
battle. That course was not pursued-
Instead the president will
resort to the only emphatic yet
peacable means by which he can
manifest the disapproval of this
Government at the German sub
marine campaign. If war results,
it will be begun by Germany and
hers will be the sole responsibili
ty.
The note to Germany, released
or pu blication late in the after
noon, was indeed a masterly and
accurate summing up of the con
tinued expansion of submarine
atrocities, even after Germany
had promised to abide by a more
hamane consideration of the
rights of neutrals upon the high
seas. Tne rreciuent has, in this
cricis, clearly and forcibly mani
fested that the time has come
when America can no longer
maintain mere submissive pa
tience in the face of a continuance
of such horrors.

Crime Does Not Pay.
The longer we live the more we
learn. We realize that honesty
is the best policy. Crime does
not pay. The man who expects
to get something for nothing
loses in the end. We must earn
our bread by the sweat of our
brow. The get rich quick man
usually knocks at the poorhouse
before his lifa ends.
Crime iu other respects does
dot pay. The man who commits
a deliberate murder may escape
the courts, but he cannot escape
his conscience.
Small crimes always precede
great ones. The boy who starts
in a career of pilfering will end in
being a crook unless his evil at
tributes are overcome.
In New York one of the most
sensational murder trials is now
in progress. A prominent phy
sician is now on trial charged
with having killed his wealthy
father in law. The web about
him is tightening. He has not
bjen convicted, but even if he es
capes the web of the law he will
be professionally ruined.
He was pressed financially and
there was an evident reason why
he should have been actuated in
the crime alleged. But even if he
hud escaped detection, even if
his purpose had been accomplish-
d, what would he have gained?
The crime would remain a bur-
len to bear silently. He never
could escape tbe death scene- His
conscience would be his hell.
The contagion of crime is like
a plague. It spreads and the
surprising fact is that there is
not a case on record of a pros
perous criminal.
Tbe man who robs a bank may
or the moment but be does not
profit by his crime. The conn
lence man may adroitly rob the
public, put he does not profit in
the end. The man who expects
by a wild speculation to rob the
innocent usually dies in poverty.
The crooked politician may prof
it in his day, .but when the call
of death comes he is usually found
to be broken in spirit, in health
and financially.
Honesty is the best policy.
The man who lives according to
God and tbe law may not achieve
success, but he is at least blessed
with a clear conscience and a
substantial eense of content.
When his end comes he can look
nto the future clear eyed. Com
