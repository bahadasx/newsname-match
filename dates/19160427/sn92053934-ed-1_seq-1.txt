SEN.HUSTING
SEES PLOT IN
NEWPROTEST
WisconsinDemocrat Charges
Telegram Campaign Is
Deep Conspiracy.
Washington, April 27. Senator
Husting, democrat, told the senate to
day that the American embargo con
ference had conducted a campaign in
Wisconsin to induce him to support an
embargo resolution against shipment
of war supplies to Europe. He submit
ted a thousand letters from Wisconsin
citizens, which he said all emanated
from the Chicago headquarters of this
organization.
Senator Husting declared there was
"a deep laid plot to poison the minds
of citizens all over the country with
the thought that the president wants
war, when every fact gives the lie to
such an assertion."
The senator submitted to the sen
ate a form letter signed by the Amer
ican Embargo Conference, W. R. Mc
Donald, secretary, sent to citizens of
Wisconsin, enclosing forms of other
letters to be sent to him urging sup
port of an embargo resolution. The
thousand letters from Wisconsin citi
zens all were identical he said. The
McDonald letter, read to the senate,
advised Wisconsin citizens to coop
erate with the embargo conference, "to
induce Paul O. Husting to join witn
the other Wisconsin representatives in
supporting an embargo resolution."
The letter urged each recipient to get
his neighbors to send copies of the ap
peal to the senator.
"I received all these letters last
February, about the time there was
considerable discussion on an embargo
resolution," Senator Husting ex
plained to the senate. "I thought then
it was no use making any public state
ment. But in connection with this tele
grahpic campaign with respect to the
German situation, I think it is quite
revelant to call attention to this mat
ter." DUTCH WARSHIP
SUNK BY BRITISH
Berlin, April 27. The Overseas
News agency says a report has been
published in the Dutch newspaper De
Tribune that the British sank
Dutch warship several weeks ago. Ac
cording to this report the crew of the
man of war was sent to India to con
ceal news of the affair and Great Brit
ain promised to pay damages.

the return of the Dutch steamship
Breda from England and said that this
steamship when on her way home was
put to inconveniences of such a nature
that it was impossible to give a de

"The Dutch newspaper De Tribune

Policy Used
in Outbreak
Is Assailed
London, April 26, (5:30 p. m.) Vis
count Middleton attacked the govern
ment in the house of lords today for
failing to heed warning regarding ac
tivities of Sinn Feins. He asked what
the government meant by saying Tues
day that the situation was well in hand.
From his information at the time this
assurance was given, not only were
rebels in possession of a number of
prominent parts of Dublin, but no
attempt has' been" made to dislodge
them.
The authorities, he continued,
knew that large numbers of armed
Sinn Feins had been drilled for
months, that they possessed explos
ives in considerable quantities and
were well provided with money.
The present position of Ireland, he
asserted, in conclusion, was one of
the greatest danger.
Lord Lansdowne in reply, said he be
lieved the outrage was doomed to be
an Ignominious failure, but he was
not disposed to minimize the serious
inconvenience likely to be occasioned
by it.
Dealing with the situation today,
Lord Lansdowne said the command
ing officer reported a complete cor
don of troops around the center of
Dublin and two more battleships were
arriving this afternoon from Eng
land. The situation, he declared, was
undoubtedly well in hand. There had
been a small uprising at Ardce and
Louth and a more serious one in
Swords and Lusk, close to Dublin.
Referring to the attempted German
landing in Ireland, Lord Lansdowne
said he did not know what Sir Roger
Casement was led to expect in the
way of assistance, but he added: "I
have been unable to find that exten
sive preparations were made for Case
ment's reception or distribution of the
material with which his ship was sup
posed to be laden."

SITUATION SERIOUS
Greater Part of Dublin Held
by Rebels Rioting and
, Fights Go on.
London, April 27 (3 :20 p.
m.) Martial law has been
declared throughout all Ire
land. Fighting is still going on In the
streets of Dublin.
Premier Asquith announced in
the house of commons today that
the rebels continue to hold Import
ant public buildings In Dublin and
street encounters were still in pro
gress. Premier Asquith told the house
the Irish situation still presented
serious features today and that
there were indications of a spread
of the movement to other parts of
Ireland, especially In the west.
The premier announced that Major1
General Sir John Maxwell, who for
merly commanded the British forces
in Egypt was leaving this afternoon
for Ireland. The general has been
given plenary powers, under martial
law, over the whole country.
The premier said there would be a
searching Investigation Into the cause
of and responsibility for the outbreak.
He added that it was necessary to ex-'
ercise military censorship while mar
tial law prevailed in Ireland. This
censorship, however, would be directed
merely to the essential military re-'
quirements of the situation.
Sir Edward Carson and John Red
mond, who were the leaders of the op
posing factions in the Irish home rule
controversy, expressed in the house of
commons their abhorrence of the up
rising and their desire to support the
government.
Military Hule Clamped On.
Official admission today that there
were indications of a spread of the
revolutionary movement in Dublin to
other parts of Ireland, especially in
the west, was accompanied by the
proclamation of martial law through
out the island. Hitherto only the city
and county of Dublin had been under
military tule because of the outbreak.
The statement regarding the spread
of the revolutionary movement was
made by Premier Asquith in the house
of commons today. The Irish situation
still presented serious features, the
premier admitted.
In Dublin fighting Is still In prog
ress in the streets and the rebels con
tinue to hold important buildings.
British Troops Sent,
It was announced that in addition to
troops already dispatched to Ireland
to cope with the situation others were
being sent and the government was
satisfied that the force assigned to this
duty was an adequate one.
Major General Sir John Maxwell,
formerly in command of the British
forces in Egypt, has gone to Ireland to
take the situation In hand. He haa
been given plenary powers over the
whole country under martial law.
A searching investigation into the
cause of the outbreak and the respon
sibility for it was promised the house
of commons by the premier.
The royal proclamation suspending
in Ireland section one of the defense of
the realm amendment acts of 1915,
which gives to a British subject
charged with an offense under the act
the right to be tried by civil court, was
read upon the steps of Royal exchange
this morning according to historic cus
tom.
From Inquiries at the foreign office
It is ascertained that there is no truth
In the report published In the United
States that martial law has been de
clared in the south of Ireland. Only in
the county of Dublin has martial law
been declared.
The report that Baron Wimborne.
lord lieutenant of Ireland, has been
captured, Is equally untrue. No inti
mation has been received at the for
eign office that any high officials have
been captured in Ireland.
