PRESIDENT WILSON SAYS VES
SEL SHOULD BE JUDGED FROM
TWO STANDARDS
WASHINGTON. Apr. 27. A stat
ment defining the attitude of the Uni
ted States toward armed .merchant
ships was made public today by the
state department by direction of Pre
sident Wilson. It originally was pre
pared as a circular note to othei
powers, hut It later was docidod to is
sue It a a statement.
The statement holds to the right ol
a merchant ship to arm for protection
only, but declares that "merchant men
which have used their armaments for
aggressive purposes are not entitled to
' the same hospitality In neutral ports
as peaceful armed merchantmen."
"The status of an armed merchant
vessel of a belligerent," says the state
ment, "is to be considered from the
point of view of a neutral when the
vessels enters Its ports, and from that
of sn enemr when the vessel Is on
the high seas."

LARRY FLYNN OUT OF BED
AFTER A SEVERE SIEGE
STOLEN JEWELRY
PARTLY IDENTIFIED
At four o'clock yesterday afternoon
an alarm of fire called the department
to tha store of Stock & Barnes at the
corner of Corona ave. and Main street.
The call was sent In by John Connors
of the Bonanza force who saw a spiral
of smoke curling from the center of
the roof. AV the same time he told
a passerby to run over and notify the
owners that their building was on fire.
In a few moments the entire rear on
Oddle avenue was ablaze and the sit
uation looked serious. The fire de
partment, with a good water pressure
succeeded in restricting the flames to
the back section which was complete
ly gutted. The roof also suffered con
siderably. Damage to tlie front was I
comparatively light and chiefly by '
water and smoke. Defective wiring is
supposed to have been the cause as
the building Is one of the old time
construction before proper insulation
onus adopted. The origin was between
the roof and the balloon ceiling where
it was difficult to reach. N
Mr. Stock suffered the principal loss
as the fire had possession ot his
sleeping room which held all his per
sonal 'effects. The first intimation
the partners had of the fire was when
a man rushed In the front door and
apprised them of the situation. Both
partners had Just finished filling or
ders and were sitting in front enjoying
a brief respite. Mr. Stock, a short
time before, had changed to his "dig
ging clothes" leaving a new spring
suit In his room. ,
Loss to the building is estimated
at $1,000 and to stock at the same fig
ure. There is no Insurance on the
building and the firm carried only
$1,000 on stock.
