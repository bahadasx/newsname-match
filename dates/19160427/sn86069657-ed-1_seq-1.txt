More About the Schools
I noticed in it recent issue of another
paper published in this county, among
other things referring to school affairs,
a comparative statement designated by
the writer as "Adair County vs. Powell
County .which comparison, as well as
various othor statements in the same
Issue, was evidently intended as a re
flection' upon the good people Iri Powell
county and especially upon every
teacher, trustee, member of the Board
of Education, and all who are- spend
ing their time nnd energy in trying to
upbuild the cause of education in the
county.
The purported statements, are sup
posed to come front the School Reports
published at Frankfort, and I looked
about and finally located one of them
and In it we And that our good county
ranks nhnyw thf-, nvprngp,; nbtwith-

County Assessors of the State, is the
smallest of any in the State. Although
Adair county is a rich county much
larger than Powejl, and has several

we are able to make the following com
parisons and will call it
POWELL-CO. vs. ADAIR-CO.

census returns is

In Ada i r county - - - - 80.
In PowelKcounty there were only

were not enrolled in any school.
