EIGHTH YEAR
DR. HILL REPLIES
TO
COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1916
Reiterates That General Re
venue of State Is Indebted
SS3.0U0 to M. U.
HE QUOTES A LETTER
NUMBER 206
Official Wrote on March 24
That the State Couldn't
Pay Requisitions.
Dr. A. Itoss Hill, president of the
University of Missouri, this morning
issued :i statement replying to stric
tures made against him by State
Auditor John I Cordon, relativs to the
financial condition of the I'jiiversity,
and published in today's St. Louis
Globe-Democrat. Auditor Cordon's
statement in the Globe-Democrat is
headed: "Mill's Charges Are All
False, Cordon Says Auditor Denies
That $S:S.000 Missouri 17. Warrants
Are Unpaid on Account of Lack of
Funds."
Doctor Hill in reply said:
"I have Just read the statement of
State Auditor Cordon and wish only to
make these comments:
"I issued no statement regarding
state finances and was unite surprised
to find the exciUnient caused by my
answer to the question, 'How much is
the general revenue of the state now
indebted to the University?' Not be
ing able to plead ignorance I answer
ed, 'More than $S3,000.' I find tlfe
exact figures are $S3,227.51. The items
are maintenance, agricultural experi
ment station, farm advisers, soil sur
vey, soil experiment fields, agricul
tural extension.
"Regarding the requisitions drawn
on the general revenue fund for these
items Mr. Cordon wrote the Univer
sity on March 21th, 'I cannot tell you
when we are going to be able to pay
them. Collections are slow and get
ting worse all the time.. We are not
in condition at this tim to iiay niiy
requisitions drawn on the revenue
fund. In fact I do not know when we
will be able to, etc'
Sajs Auditor Quibble.
"Yet Mr. Cordon intimates that my
statement is absolutely false and that
I certainly knew it was false, and he
adds. 'There is not a single state war
rant outstanding that is unpaid at this
time.' This is the merest quibble. He
knows that lie has failed to draw war
rants in honor of our requisitions to
the extent of $S3,227.51 for the first
thr c months of this year, though he
has not questioned the legitimate
claims of these requisitions.
"I understand Mr. Gordon's conten
tion regarding the constitutional pro
vision as to the order of appropria
tions, but when in his statement he
speaks of the order in which state
money 'shall be if-ed' a legal question
arises on which neither lie nor I can
claim the knowledge or ability to pass.
Tlie attorneys I have consulted, how
ever, disagree with his interpretation.
He further claims that 'not a word tsi
the Constitution or Missouri says any
thing about the support of the State
fniv rsity.' His reading of the con
stitution has evidently not been very
careful or thorough and it might be
well for him to read it again before
citing it.
"It was in connection with Mr. Gor
don's interpretation of the constitution
that I explained how the educational
institutions of the state suffer while
requisitions for other state expenses
are honored. I was asked about the
state oilic rs and their assistants and
remarked that I supposed they were
paid regularly, as appropriations for
that purpose were made quite early in
the list of appropriation bills. The
phraseology used was the reporter's.
but even in the unauthorized state
ment attributed to me no one can find
any criticisms of the number or fam
ily connections of the assistants in the
several state departments.
As to the Public .School Fund.
"I am sure that every one be pleas
ed to know that the public school
fund will not suffer, whatever
the condition of the state treasury
may happen to me. That is, however,
so expressly provided for by
constitution and statutes that the
assurance of the auditor is not nec
essary. Furthermore, not even in the
flamboyant accounts of my innocent
statements of fact regarding the finan
cial embarrasment in which the State
University finds itself is there any inti
mation that the University has been
discriminated against as compared
with the other state educational insti
tutions. It is quite possible that all

President of V. M. C. A. Colic
cngo Speaks.
Dr. Frank 11. Hurt, president of the
Young Men's Christian Association
College of Chicago, addressed thirty
members of the local V. M. C. A. at
luncheon this noon to enlist a limited
number of young men in what he calls
"a new profession," that of making
Y. M. C. A. activities a life work.
The new calling sejks to train men
for tlie positions of secretaries and
physical training instructors in the Y.
M. C. A.'s throughout the country.
According to Doctor Hurt, it is dis
tinctly a Christian calling not one' to
be entered for the sake of financial re
turns, but on? which will give the
workers an opportunity to benefit hu
manity. Mm who become Y. M. C. a.
secretaries will be managers of a
great Christian enterprise, Doctor
Hurt says.
"The great issu-s of today are so
cial issues those of commercial and
industrial relationships," said Doctor
Hurt. "Tlie growth of the Y. M. C. A.
sprang from the rapid growth of cities
during the last generation. The asso
ciation's work has gone forward by
leaps and bounds. Fifte?n years ago
our property was worth about $25,
000,000; now it is worth nearly
$100,000,000. We have one or more
buildings In every city of fairly large
population."
The Y. M. C. A. College of Chicago
offers a two and three-y?ar course in
the training of young men to be Y. M.
C. A. secretaries and physical direc
tors. Theodore Smith, who was a stu
dent in the University of Missouri last
year, is studying there.

I. I!. Womall IIes In Kansas City
Douglas Huchanan Womall, a for
mer student in the University, died
last Tuesdav in Kansas Citv at the
home of his father-in-law, s. L. Long.
3204 Flora avenue. Mr. Womall
was 27 years old. He is survived by
his wife. Mrs. Louise Long Wornall;
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel E.
Wornall and two sisters and a brother,
all of Kansas City. Mr. Wornall stud
ied electrical engineering and law
while in the University. For the last
five years he had been in the real es
tate brokerage business. He was a
"Hetter mohers and better babies"
is the slogan of the .Missouri Congress
and Parent-Teacher Associations, and
no other interest shall be allowed to
interfere. This is the sentiment of
the majority of tlie delegates here.
The question of suffrage, which came
up in yesterday's sessions, has been
ruled out of general discussion and a
few reports blue-pencilled, in order
that harmony and co-operation on the
subject of child welfare might be cer
tain. A resolution indorsing suffrage
was, however, introduced In the reso
lutions committee this morning. Late
this afternoon it had not been voted
on.
Mrs. A. L. Yingling, who appeared
on the program this afternoon, ex
pressed what she considered to be the
feeling of many delegates to the con
gress when she said: "The work of
the Mothers' Council is going to broad
en out until it shall be the great con
necting link not only between the
homo and the school but between
the home and all departments of gov
crnment. I don't care if I never have
a vote, but I do want Intelligent
homes."
Applause for K. ('. Club.
A feature of the morning's meeting
which drew great applause was the
presentation by the Kansas City coun
cil of one-third of $S00, derived from
a local benefit performance. The
check presented was for $100, and the
council retains in Kansas City over
$175 to be used in state welfare work.
The remainder is to be divided equally
between the local council and the
schools of Kansas City in proportion
to the tickets sold for the benefit.
Mrs. Xorman M. Windsor of St.
Louis, vice-president of the congress,
said that the aim of the congress was
to raise the standard of home life.
"We believe that you should bring up
a parent the way he should go and
when he is old his children will not
disgrace him. The aims of our or
ganization are beautiful." In the last
year Mrs. Windsor has organized
twenty-two associations and has
twenty more in the process of or
ganization. The reports of the presidents con
tinued this morning.
The St. Louis clubs are doing a
great amount of work in different
ways. The Chamberlain circle estab
lished the first bubbling water foun
tain on the streets of St. Louis. This
same club raised $C0O at a ball game
for a babies' night ranm. It la Jipro
that the mothers from the slums are

TAUU

. E. McPherson Explains
Health Measures-Psychologist
on Child Rearing.
The welfare of the children moral
and physical was the chief subject for
discussion atthe second evening session
of the .Missouri Congress of Mothers
and Parent-Teacher Associations, held
at the Christian Church last night.
J. E. McPherson, superintendent of
the public schools of Columbia, dis
cussed the physical health of the child
in his talk on "The Co-operation of
Mothers' Circles with School Authori
ties in Preventing the Spread of Con
tagious Diseases." He enumerated the
methods of control that have been
used in the Columbia public schools
with good effect, and showed how the
co-operation of the school authorities
with the Hoard of Health, the physi
cians, the City Council and the Moth
ers' Clubs had reduced contagious dis
eases to a minimum in Columbia.
"There are 2,100 children in school,"
said Mr. McPherson. "In tills number
there have been one case of pink-eye,
two cases of chicken pox, four cases of
whooping cough, three cases of the
itch, eight cases of pneumonia, seven
cases of scarlet fever, five cases of
small pox, 203 cases of measles, and
317 cases of grip. Xot speaking of the
epidemic of grip, measles is the only
disease that baffled our efforts at pre
vention, and this was because it was
spread by the University students."
Oil the Rearing of Children.
Dr. W. II. Pyle, professor of psy
chology at the University, gave in his
lecture on "Common Sense in Training
Children," the principal facts which
parents should bear In mind if they
should rear children well. He said:
"Although everything else has fallen
in the realm of science, child nature is
the last to be considered. We are just
conceiving the idea that children are
causal things that live in the world of
order, and that the outcome of child
life is a thing about which there can
be no doubt if we have the facts in
hand. We now study the child as a
living being whose whole life we can
direct and control, and it is only this
principle of causality that makes edu
cation possible.
Parents should remember to study
the nature of the child and to build
up habits if they would train their
children effectively. The schools
can't do everything, because the fun
damental morals are all learned be
fore the child steps into the school
room. A close relation of parents and
teachers is necessary, however, and
in addition to this, there should b3
sufficient neighborhood agreement to
insure harmony between your chil
dren and those of other parents."
False Ideas of Labor.
Doctor Pyle gave his view on tlie
child and work.
"Teachers are sometimes to blame
for the false ideas of children in re
gard to manual labor," he said. "They
teach the child that he must go to
school and get an education so that,
when through, he may wear a white
shirt and gloves, and keep his hands
clean. Unless teachers stop this, I
see no hope for the future of democ
racy. The child should be guid'd in
to the occupation for which he Is best
fitted, a,nd teachers can aid in this by
teaching the children that all honest
labor is dignified."
Northwest Part of Citv Will
Insist on I laving School
in That Section.
The Columbia Schoor Hoard will
call r. special meeting to consider in
creasing the $80,000 proposed bond is
sue for schools to $100,000. This was
the announcement made by F. W.
Xiedermeyer, president of the board.
this afternoon at the close or a Com
mercial Club meeting in which pro
tests from the northwest part of Co
lumbia were made against the propos
ed location of the new school building
mentioned in the bond proposition.
Superintendent J. E. McPherson ex
plained a chart and said the center
of congestion north of Hroadway was
near the shoe factory. The bond is
sue calls for a ward school to cost
$2G,000, to ho located "north of Hroad
way." A. M. Sehwabe, who lives in the
northwest part of town, said the peo
ple of that district wanted to know
before oting on the issue whether
the school would be built in that sec
tion. "The way the schools are located
now," he said, "our children have to
go through negro town to go to school.
If this bond proposition doesn't get
us a school we are going to keep the
rest of the town from getting one."
Dr. J. H. Cole suggested that the
sehool board increase the bond propo
sition to $100,000, and that two four
room schools be built north of Hroad
v.ay instead of one six-room school
as proposed. To consider these sug
gestions F. W. Xiedermeyer said he
would call a special meeting of the
board.
The five items in tlie bond issue
now advertised to be oted on.are $35,
000 for a negro school, S2G.O0O for a
new ward school north of Hroadway,
$12,000 for addition and grounds to
the Lee school, $12,000 for grounds
at the Jefferson school and the High
School, $5,000 for improvements at
the Henton school.
