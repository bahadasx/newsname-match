MINNESOTA A
SUMMER RESORT
Fortieth Annual Meet of State For
estry Association Held to Ad
vertise Summer Resorts.
Minneapolis, Minn,. April 27.
Making Minnesota the mecca of sum
mer tourists was discussed at the
fortieth annual meeting of the Min
nesota Forestry association, in ses
sion at the West hotel today.
"Exploitation of Minnesota's rec
reation grounds means the building
up of public health and prosperity,"
Lange, president of the associa
tion, said today.
"Tourists leave in the Maine woods
$20,000,000 each year and in the Ad
irondacks $15,000,000. Our lake and
forest region is more attractive and
larger than the whole tsate of Maine
and Adirondacks put together, so let
us plan for concerted boosting," said
Lange.
A feature of the meeting was mo
ving pictures of lakes and forests and
the work of the forest rangers in Min
nesota in actually fighting a lire. The
session will close with a banquet this
evening.
The executive committee of the
state forestry association of which
Mrs. C. J. Backus, St. Paul, is chair
man, will reward prizes of young pine
trees to winners of tree planting med
als in Minnesota, at the meeting. The
medals were given nearly 40 years
ago by the association, but the execu
tive committee has been unable to lo
cate any of them.
A unique feature will be the ban
quet this evening. All the forest
rangers in Minnesota and others in
terested in forest work will attend the
banquet in the clothes worn by these
men in the woods. Flannel shirts,
duck trousers and boots will be much
in evidence.

"COMEDYOFERRORS"
IS SENIOR PLAY
One of the First Plays Written by
Shakespeare to Be Presented
May 12 and 13.
The Seniors of the Bemidji high
school have chosen as their class
play, Shakespeare's "Comedy of Er
rors It will be presented at the
Grand theater May 12 and 13.
Since Sunday was the three hun
dredth anniversary of Shakespeare's
death, this play is especially appro
priate for this year. In many parts
of the country Shakesperean festi
vals, pageants and plays are being
given by schools and colleges in hon
or of the world's greatest poet. This
revival is serving a twofold tribute
not only is it a tribute to Shake
speare, but it is bringing his plays
closer to the people of today.
The charming little play, "The
Comedy of Errors," was one of the
first plays written by Shakespeare.
It is simplicity itself, and yet so well
constructed that the events seem the
climax of an eventful day in the life
of a family.
The Seniors have chosen the most
simply way for staging the play.
Since a reproduction of the Shake
perean stage is not possible, there
will be one setting, representing a
street scene in Ephesus where the
action takes place. The scene needs
no change as the events of the play
all take place within a few hours.
As long as the setting is to be
scenic, the costumes will probably
be the classic draperies of the Greek
period. The costuming will be done
by a St. Paul firm which is making
a specialty of Shakespeare plays

Instructions Sent.
Washington, April 27.General in
structions for the assistance of Ma
jor Gcneial Hugh Scott at his
forthcoming conference with Carran-
/sa's war minister, General Obregon,
were dratted by Secretary Baker
yesterday after brief conferences with
President Wilson and with Secretary
Lansing of the state department.
The only official statement as to
the ^nature of the instructions was
the following issued by Secretary
Baker:
"The instructions are to discuss a
basis for the most cordial and com
plete co-operation between the Amer
ican and Mexican forces in the at
tainment of their common object."
For Better Understanding.
While the immediate object of the
conference is a question of military
disposition to put an end to bandit
operations along the border, there is
no dojubt that its result will have a
strong influence upon the diplomatic
negotiations between the two govern
ments.
It is considered certain that Gener
al Obregon will parry back to Mexico
City on his return a definite impres
sion that the American troops will re
main in the position to which Gen
eral Funston is now shifting them as
a buffer between the disturbed area of
Northern Mexico and the border, un
til the success of the Carranza forces
in pursuing the bandits removes dan
ger of further raid on American
towns.

Into Effect Flat Rate
For All.
As a result of the re-rating of
Northern Minnesota to make it sim
ilar to the rate in Southern Minne

are showing big decreases.
There is a flat rate on dwelling
houses under the new ruling. A
dwelling with a foundation is insured
on a basis of 32 cents per hundred.

insured on the basis of 52 cents per
hundred.

in the rates on dwellings of about 60
per cent.
One thousand dollars insurance on
a dwelling in Bemidji under the old
rate would cost $22.09. Under the
new rating the same house could be
insured for $1,000 for about' eight
dollars.
Reductions in Q/her rates are as
follows: One-story brick buildings

St. Paul, Minn., April 27.--The eyes
of the Minnesota Highway commis

the New Orleans to Winnipeg
roadwayfrom St. Cloud, through St.
Cloud, Little Falls or Brainerd, Walk
er, Bemidji and thence through Bel
trami county north to the interna
tional border or west from Bemidji
to Thief River Falls and then north,

ing at Moorhead placed an official

cial pledge of financial support of
constructing a model highway
through Clay county to bring the Jef
ferson highway from St Cloud
through Fergus Falls, through Moor
head and Fargo and thence north to
Winnipeg.
This new route would entirely
avoid the Itasca State park and Be

given due consideration.
