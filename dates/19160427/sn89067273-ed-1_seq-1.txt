WOOD CRAFT STORY
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.
Fourth Story.
'Tfl ROTHER Terrapin waddled down the buck
Tjjjbush path in the direction of the creek- He
had heard wonderful tales of the bungalow of
Brother and Sister Muskrat and wanted to see
for himself just how it looked inside. Several little
folks of the woods that could swim had inspected
the new home and pronounced it a little wonder.
"Hello, Muskrat, Hello," he calls when he reach
es the water's edge- "I tell you, Slim Weasel,
this is the finest home in the woods, and I will
give an armful of wild celery roots to the one
that can show as much skill in building a home."
"That sounds almost like bragging," thought
Brother Terrapin. So diving under the water
he squeezed through the door of the Muskrat
home and crawled up stairs.
"Ah, here is old friend Terrapin," remarked
Muskrat, "You are the very fellow I wanted to see."
Mother Muskrat remarked, "You have caught
this house in a pretty mess. We have had the
Muskrat carpenters and the Beaver plasterers
the entire week and I was telling Father Muskrat
last night I would never build another house.
I would rather live in a hole in the bank like
some Muskrats do." Brother Terrapin replied,
"Your home looks fine beside mine. You see,
I go to bed when the frost comes and sleep until
the violet call me in the Spring, and my house
is something awful. But I must be going.''
Sister Muskrat who showed him the way to
the front door suggested that she thought it
would be fine for the one that had the nicest
home to be Queen of the Forest- Mrs. Channel
Cat who was listening at the foot of the stairs
had barely time to swim away before Terrapin
appeared.
It was agreed upon that a committee of three
should select the Queen, so Dr. Owl, Slim Weasel
and Red Squirrel were chosen.
"Why not leave $t to Brother Terrapin," re
marked Gentle Dove, "He is a good fellow and
is always square." What she really meant was,
not that he was square like a board, for when
he takes his sun bath on the end of a log in the
creek, draws his head and feet and tail in his
shell, he is almost as round as a dollar; but Gen
tle Dove, like a good many people I know, always
wants to say something nice about someone, and
some way or another it always helps a fellow.
Don't you think so?
The Committee called at Gray Squirrels house
in the water oak tree. Gray Squirrel showed
them the nicest little cupboard filled with hick
ory nuts, and one with walnuts, and, strange to
say, still another with hickory nuts.
"What are these for," asked the owl.
"These are to plant in the ground to make trees.
Some one whispers in our ear to do so and that
is all I can tell you about it."
Oh," remarked Dr. Owl, "I see."
;-They found Sister Rabbit at home with ten
little babes. Each one with a little white spot in
his forehead and looking just like his brother.
"My, but that is a warm nest,'' said the Weasel,
. "I wish I had one like it in the drift."
When they reached the Mockers' beautiful nest,
Mother Mocker was just in the act of giving
her two children a shove over the edge of the
nest to teach them to use their wings. The Owl
who sat down close by the edge of the nest saw
the many little threads she had woven into her
nest, and noticed how carefully she had laid the
twigs that made the outside of her home. "I am of
notion to make my nest over again," he thought
as they went toward the Muskrat's home, which
looked like a sure winner. Above the water
line in the garret were several soft, warm beds
and the 'family .were always safe from the sleet
and snow in the winter.
"Oh, Dad, look here," called the boy from the
camp opposite the Muskrats' house. "Come and
look at this pretty little humming-bird's nest."
His father, tip-toeing to his side, replied, "Yes,
son, the humming bird shows more skill in build
ing its home than any other little creature in the
forest. She's Queen of the Forest! If you will
notice, she has selected a limb on this small tree
. and building up an artificial knot has covered
it over with tiny bits of bark from the trunk of
the tree, and, lining the nest with silk from the
weed pods', has made a little castle of her own.'
Dr. Owl, looking away in the woods, remarked,
"I vote for the tiny Humming Bird." Red Squir
rel replied, "I do declare, I always before this
thought that was a knot." Weasel exclaimed, "She
is my choice, too."
The boy's father was heard to say, "Come on,
son, or the bacon will be cold "
