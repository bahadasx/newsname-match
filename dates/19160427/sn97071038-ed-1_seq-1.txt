Congress Appropriates $75,000 For
' , Biological Survey to Carry on
Extermination Work In
' Western States.
Washington, D. C, April 28. The
appropriation by Congress in the Ur
gent Deficiency Act of $75,000 tor
the control of rabies among coyotes
In the West has enabled the Bflreau
of Biological Survey of the XL S. De
partment of Agriculture, to puh5 in
spectors and 190 hunters in the field,
in addition to its existing organiza
tion. These men are to serve in Ore
gon, Nevada, California, and Idaho,
and along the border in Utah. In
addition to these measures the Neva
da Rabies Commission has signified
Its Intention of expending a large
sum of money under recommenda
tions made by the Biological Survey,
and it is probable that other States
will do likewise. Stockmen and ranch
owners are cooperation by furnishing
horses and forage free of charge.
The importance of preventing the
spread of the disease is fully realized.
The coyote has always been a pest
to stockmen, but with the advent of
rabies it has become a serious dan
ger to persons as well as to stock. In
many sections of Oregon, Idaho, Cali
fornia, and Nevada, parents are
afraid to send their children to school
unless they are well guarded, and
there is always danger that domestic
dogs will be bitten by the mad ani
mals and spread the disease to the
families of their owners. In Oregon
and Nevada over 100 persons have
received the Pasteur treatment for
rabies within the past three years
and stock interests have suffered se
verely. In one feed lot In Winne
nmea, Nevada, a single coyote caused
the loss of 23 head of three-year-old
beef steers. v
Although this is regarded as the
most serious, it is not the first out
break of rabies among coyotes In the
Western States. In 1911 the dis
ease made its appearance In Wallowa
County, Oregon, and spread south
ward. This infestation still contin
ues. In the spring of 1915 the dis
ease made it3 first appearance in
northern Nevada, and at the present
time southwestern Idaho, northwest
ern California, and approximately the
northern half of Nevada are Infeste'd.
The normal coyote is cunning but
cowardly and has a particular aver
sion to the scent of a human beini?.
When stricken with rabies, however,
it idoes not hesitate to snap at every
thing in reach and to attack men as
well as dogs and cattle. In this con
dition it does not eat and consequent
ly can not be killed by poisonous
baits.
In controlling the disease the Bu
reau of Biological Survey purposes
first to prevent its spread by killing
off the coyotes along the borders of
the Infested districts. After this has
been done, the infected areas them
selves can effectually be rid of the
animals and the disease stamped out,
STALLION POSTERS EX
PLAINED FOR OWNERS
Stallion owners who make an
nouncement of service of their horse
by means of posters must give con
sideration to the four following
points in order to have the poster
comply with the legal requirements:
Name of stallion and owner; state
ment of place of stand; terms of ser
vice and copy of license from Stallion
Registration Board.
It is in the copy of the license that
serious danger of error lies. It is re
quired that the word pure-bred or
grade or mongrel, as the case may be,
shall be printed in type one inch in
highth. Posters that omit any of
these points are Illegal and will have
to be corrected upon notification from
the Secretary of the Registration
Board.
"The policy of advertising benefits
both the owner of the horse and the
horse breeder." said Carl N. Kennedy,
secretary of the board in explaining
the requirements of the poster law.
The owner in this way supplies much
needed information to breeders and
thereby secures better returns from
his investment In the horse. Breed
ers by receiving this information, are
able to select the horse they wish to
breed to and the stands that are most
convenient to them.
"As an illustration of this value to
owners of mares," continued Mr.
kennedy, "the experience of the ani
mal husbandry department at O. A.
C. might be mentioned. In order to
secure this information it was neces
sary to make several trips to the local
livery stables, involving trouble, ex
pense and delay. There are very few
reasons for general advertising that
do not apply with equal or special
force to announcements of stallion
service in the local paper."

native haunts. The pictures are said
to be highly educational as well as
being interesting. They were recent
