Rich Missouri Graiu
Country.
the
D. B. Kevil, vice president and
manager of the Sikes-McMullin
Grain Company, of Sikeston. tells
The Herald that his company
has let the contract for three
new grain elevators for McMul
lin, Essex and Kewanee. These
new elevators will be constructed
of concrete reinforced with steel.
They will be fireproof and will
be equipped with the moat mod
em machinery for handling
grain. Among the equipment
will be an automatic scale with
one thousand bushels per hour
capacity, steel dump wagon,
scales and gasoline engine for
power.
The elevators will have a
height of eighty feet each and a
capacity of twenty thousand
bushels of grain.
The Sikes-McMullin drain Com
pany operates lourtecn grain
stations, located in Scott and ad
jacent counties. The total stor
age capaciiy of the firms tleva
tirs and warehouses, when the
new elevators are completed will
be ih),( (in bushels. The compa
ny in providing these elevators
and adding other equipment arc'
expending approximately $10,.
000. This evidently is a good
show of faith on their part in
the material possibilities of this
section of the State.
The grain company has also
purchased the elevator operated
b Garrett & Schnarrat Vandus
er, Mo., and will at once remodel
it and put it in first class con
dition for grain handling. New
bins, new dump scales and new-
power equipment will be install
ed. When the improvement of
tfiis elevator is completed the
company will have an addition
al storage capacity of eighteen
thousand bushels of eat rornand
ten thousand bushels of bulk
grain. -Sikeston Herald.

Hard to Tell Misfortune.
"One nice thing about lite as I
see it." says Congressman Ed
ward J. King, of Illinois, in the
May American Magazine, "is
that misfortune cannot always
be set down for a certainty as
misfortune unless one judges it
in the light of later events, and
by that time it frequently proves
;tobe not a misfortune at all,
but a blessing in disguise"

Narcissus Field.
Morganfield, Ky.. Anril 22.
! Union county's memorial to her
pioneer settlers will be unveiled
the last week in April, for the
white narcissus field blooms year
ly as a tribute to the unknown
men and women who came there
long ago and tried to make their
homes.
Seven miles from Morganfield,
ky., just off the old Sulphur
Springs road, acres of blossoms
stretch in an unbroken pano
ramma. Part of the road is roucrh
and little used, for few neo-
ple travel it except when
. 1 - - 1 1 I 1 rr.
me neia mooms. ine hills are
white with dogwood and at the
foot acres of blossoms stretch
in unbroken white. The only
break in the beautiful monotony
is the pink of two crab apple
trees.
And this is the story of the
white narcissus field:
Year3 and years ago, when
western Kentucky was a new
country, some settlers chose this
spot for their homes. They
built log cabins and, because this
was to be their home, they plant
ed flowers, always a sure sign
that civilization has come to stay.
But the little colony failed and
many of the pioneers died. They
were buried there with no stones
to marK their graves, but on
each grave some one who loved
them planted white narcissus.
Later, when the land around
was cultivated,, the old burying
ground was left untouched. For
vear3 the flowers have bloomed
and spread and remembered
those early dead. Now there is
not a spot that is not covered
with white blossoms. The field
is a wonderful living memorial
to the unknown men and those
who loved them enough to plant
flowers.
When the field blooms the
rough little road has more travel
than it knows all the rest of the
year. Dozens of cars go each
day, and leave massed with
flowers. Boxes are sent all over
the State, and all the hospitals
are remembered. April and the
white narcissus field will always
remember those pioneers, and to
be remembered by flowers is a
beautiful memorial. Henderson

RELATIVES CELE
BRATEBIRTHDAY Of Robert D. Moore and All Enjoy
A Happy Reunion and wish
Him Many More.
On April 10th, 1916, at his res
idence in the Glendale vicinity,
gathered a number of relatives
to celebrate the 80th birthday of
the venerable Robert D. Moore.
He being the only survivor of
the large family of the former
Robert Moore of this county.
Regardless of his age and ill
health of this year, the day
seemed to be an uplift to him,
and for the time, he seemed to
take a new lease. on life's bor.
rowed time.
The day was enjoyed by all,
as every means was used by his
daughter, Miss Nannie, assisted
by his daughters-in-law, to make
the occasion a pleasant cne.
At the noon hour all formali
ties being wholly discarded (for
something better.) We entered
heartily into a delicious "old
time Kentucky dinner," which
did credit to any modern social
function.
The short hours of the after
noon were varied by music furn
ished by organ, victrola and
laughter of an Easter egg party.
Tne junior member of the party
being the 4th Robt. Moore of the
family notwithstanding his ten
der age of tvo summers, he man
ifested and created more interest
than any other member engaged
in the search.
Those 'present for the day,
were Messrs. R. E., and R. C.
Moore and families. Harvey J.
and Miss Nannie, who resides
with the father; two nieces, Mrs.
Lummie Yates Clark and Miss
Addie Franks: one nephew. Mas
ter Miller Hurley. Misses Mary
and Sue Moore could not be pres
ent, being enrojte to the K. E.
A., in Louisville.
After good-byes had been said,
each left for his respective
home, wishing they might all
have many happy returns of the
day. A Niece.
