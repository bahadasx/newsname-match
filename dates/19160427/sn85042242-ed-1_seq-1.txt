New York, April 26.—The German
government was prepared to pay
$500,000 each for the destruction of
ships loaded with war supplies. for
the Entente Allies,, Lieutenant Rob­
ert Fay, of the German army on trial
in the United States court'for con­
spiracy, was quoted today as having
informed Carl L. Wittig, a witness
lor ihe prosecution.
"I asked him," testified Wittig, a
chemical engineer, "if he knew what.
?r»00,000 was, and he replied money
was no object in this thing."
Wittig, who declared his sympa­
thies in the war were with France,
told of informing the French embas­
sy of his conversations. The em­
bassy in turn notified the New York
police.
On trial with Fay are his brother
in-law. Walter Schul/.. and Paul Ae
che. Wittig said he told Fay and
Schuly. that in placing bombs on ships
with which they were unfamiliar they
were placing "innocent people in
jeopardy."
"Sclnilz declared," added the wit­
ness, "that tlioy knew what they
were doing that Max Breitung was
tolling them on which ships ammu­
nition was being shipped."
Hroitung also is under indictment
lor the alleged conspiracy.
Sheriff Eludes Gang by Remov­
ing Prisoner to Some Other
Point.
Topeka, Kan., April 2fi.—Several
automobile loads of men left here for
Lawrence tonight with the avowed in­
tention of removing Fred Bissell, the
man charged with murdering Edna
Dinsmore, a 10-year-old girl, and
lynching him.
A warrant charging Fred Bissell, a
baker, with the murder of Edna Dins
more, the 10-year-old girl who was
found dead in a burning house here
yesterday, was issued by county au­
thorities late today. Rissell is iii
jail at Lawrence, Kan.
Lawrence, Kan._ April 20.—Upon
receipt, of information that a mob
formed at Topeka, was on the way
here with the intention of lynching
Fred Bissell, Sheriff L. L. Kiene re­
moved Bissell from the jail at 9:30
o'clock tonight and left Lawrence in
a motor car, accompanied by a force
of deputies. The destination of the
sheriff with his prisoner is unknown.
An attempt on the part of the mob
formed in Topeka tonight to lynch
Bissell at Lawrence failed, on the
prompt action of the county and state
officials who caused the prisoner to
be taken away and hurried off in an
automobile. Bissell is charged with
assaulting and murdering a ten-year
old girl, whose body was found in a
burning vacant house in Topeka yes­
terday morning.
When knowledge of the departure
of the mob in autombiles reached
Gvernor Capper tonight, the governor
at once sent a message to Sheriff
Cummings of Douglas county, at Law­
rence, urging that Bissell be removed
to evade the lynchers. He advised
that he be taken to Lansing, to the
state penitentiary until the time of
his trial.
Sheriff Kiene of Topeka, who was
in Lewrence to serve a warrant' on
Bissell, took charge of the prisoner
and left with the prisoner in a large
touring car from that place. It is be­
lieved he started for Lansing. About
the time the would-be lynchers left
here for Lawrence another mob
stormed the county jail, under the be­
lief that Bissel had not been taken
from Topeka. Officers addressed them
and finally a committee of citizens
was appointed to examine the jail.
The committee's report satisfied the
mob around the jail and in a short
time the mob dispersed.
GEORGE TO ASSIST
FRAINE FIGHT
Grand Forks, April 26.—John Pralne
has selected M. F. George, secretary
of the senate, to assist him in his

ment over the state. It is expected
that headquarters will be opened soon

Use Bank
System, Says
McCumber
Washington, April 26.—Senator
McCumber urged the senate today to
adopt, his substitute for the pending
administration's rural credit bill. .He
insisted that the features of his bill,
proposing the employment of national
banks, state banks and trust com­
panies as the .machinery for getting
the loans to the farmers would be
far less expensive than the system
of land banks provided for in Ihe ad­
ministration measure.
'No action was taken on substi­
tutes or any amendments proposed
to the bill.

CAUSES STIR IN

Dr. Platou of Valley City has re­
fused to stand for the Stenvick-Burke
deal to pull him out of the governor­
ship race. At least, he says he will
run. Since the beans were spilled,
he denies that he had any intention
of withdrawing, although Wooledge,
a iMinot. democrat, in Tuesday even­
ing's Minneapolis Journal announced
the withdrawal of Platou and McAr
thur and the elevation of Stenvick to
the chairmanship of Ihe stale central
committee.
There is no doubt but that Sten­
vick, on his way to Washington lo

Dr. Platou was one of the men favor­

Whether this will upset the slate
fixed up by the ring of federal of­
fice holders is not. known. The fact
is, however, they are deeply disap­
pointed over Plalou's stand in refus­
ing to stay put, especially the friends
of Burke.

CONFERENCE EXPECTED
TO STOP VANDALISM
Co-operation Between American
and Mexican Troops the
Object
Washington, April 26.—General in
structicns for the assistance of Ma­
jor General Hugh Scolt, at his forth­
coming conference with Carranza's
war minister, Ueneral Obregon, were
drafted by Secretary E'aker today,
a brief conference with President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing of the
state department.
General Obregon was due to arrive
at Eagle Pass tonight.
The only official statement as to
the nature of the instructions was
the following, issued by Secretary
Baker:
"The instructions are to discuss a
basis for the most cordial and com­
plete co-operation between the Amer­
ican and .Mexican forces in the at­
tainment of their common object."
While the immediate object of the
conference is a question of military
disposition to put an end to bandit
operations along the border, there is
no doubt thai its results will have a
strong influence on the diplomatic
negotiations between the two govern­
ments.
It is considered certain that Gen­
eral Obregon will carry back to Mex­
ico City, on his return, a definite im­
pression that the American troops
will remain in the position to which
General Funslon is now shifting then"!
as a, buffer between the disturbed
area and Ihe border until the suc­
cess of Ihe Carranza. forces in pur­
suit of Ihe bandits remove the danger
of .fuftjanjvjuids on American t*vvnf.
II also Ts virtually certain that' the
intention of the American forces to
police thorooughly all the territory in
the immediate vicinity of their ad­
vance bases, will he made clear.
To this extent, the conference will
give Carranza advance notice of the
altitude the United States will take
in responding lo his note of April 12,
suggesting the withdrawal of the
forces.
Officials hope, however, that its
more immediate result, will be to
clear away Ihe misunderstanding and
suspicion with which Ihe movement
of American troops have been re­
garded by local Mexican commanders
and officials to free supply ship­
ments for the troops from interfer­
ences with which they have met
heretofore, and to make possible joint
efforts for Ihe capture of Villa.
Willi the elimination of Villa, eith­
er by American or iMoxican troops,
it is believed the Washington govern­
ment. would agree to an immediate
retirement of the expedition acrort
the border.
It would be made clear in Ibis con­
nection that United States officers
have no doubt of their ability to cap
ure the bandit, were it not for their
desire to avoid clashes wih the Mex­
icans such as occurred at tParral.
Renewal of Hunt.
A renewal of the hunt for the ban­
dit by American troopers now is in
progress, both official reports from
General Funston and border advices
disclose. The cavalrymen, despite
the worn condition of their mounts,
are beating the mountains where Vil­
la adherents have been assembling
during the lull in the chase.
Villa Still in Hiding.
'No information as to the where­
abouts of Villa himself has been re­
ceived. The war department gave out
this dispatch from General Funston:
"Following just, received from Gen­
eral Pershing:
'Xamiquipa, April 25.—A report
dated April 24, received today from

With the Separatist
Party.
BRITISH TO DEAL

Reported to Be Tran

London, April 26.—British regulars
from Belfast and England are now in
Dublin, and have recaptured, from the
revolutionary factions several import­
ant centers which members of the
Sinn party and their adherents had
occupied.
As a measure of precaution, martial
law has been proclaimed in the city of
Dublin and the county, and the official
announcement is made that drastic
steps are being taken to suppress the
movement in Ireland and arrest all
those responsible for it. Several ar­
rests are already said to have been
made.
That the government intends to
deal with the offenders wits a heavy
hand is indicated by the publication
of a proclamation in the Official Gaz­
ette tonight, suspending in Ireland,
Section L, of the defense of the Welch
amendment act of 1.915, which gives
to the British subjcct, charged with
an offense under the act, the right to
be tried by a civil court.
The proclamation recites that "the
present state of affairs in Ireland
such as to constitute a special mili­
tary emergency," as specified in sub­
section 7 of the act, which states that
in the event of an invasion, or other
special military emergencies, arising
out. of the present war, the operations
of Section may be suspended either
generally or in a specified area.
Premier Asquith, in the house of
commons, and Lord Lnysdowne, in the
house of lords, made reassuring state

situation in Iremmi.

Williston Residents Form Stock
Company and Will Build
Toll Bridge.
Governor L. H. Ifanna returned yes­
terday from Williston, where he at­
tended the dedication of the new arm­
ory at that place. The new building
is one of the finest In the stale, said
the Governor. A general holiday was
declared in Williston Tuesday, when
the new building was dedicated.
The Governor also brought, word of
the formation of a stock company at
Williston for the purpose of putting a
pontoon bridge across the Missouri.
The company was only recently form­
ed, but has already succeeded in put­
ting a bill thorugh congress author­
izing the construction of the bridge.
The new structure will be completed
and opened to traffic within the next
thirty days. Governor Hanna sug­
gested that Bismarck and Mandan
residents get together and follow the
example of Williston, by the erection
of a pontoon bridge here. A bill auth­
orizing the construction of a bridge
could be put through congress, he
stated, within thirty days, and local
residents as well as travelers on the
"Red Trail" would enjoy the use of
it this summer.
A number of pontoon bridges have
been put across the Missouri south of
this place, and more or less trouble
has been experienced with them.
However, it is believed that with new­
er methods of anchoring the struc­
tures, they can be made reasonably
safe and secure.

AWAIT COPIES
OF BRITISH ORDERS
Washington, April 26.—An official
declaration of the attitude of the
United States toward armed merchant
ships made public today by Secretary
Lansing reiterates and explains the
purpose of t'ie American government
to recognize the rights of peaceful
vessels to carry arm.- for defense and
at the sam? time, while referring to
warships only, generally sets forth
clearly the conditions under which
the United States holds submarines
may attack merchant craft.
The declaration was issued in the
form of a memorandum prepared by
Mr. Lansing at President Wilson's di­
rection, during the secretary's brief
vacation 'est month.
In connection with the memoran­
dum, it was stated that the state de­
partment now was awaiting a re­
sponse from Great Britain to a re­
quest for copies of orders to arm Brit­
ish merchant vessels. Germany has
charged that these ships were induc­
ed to act aggressively against submar­
ines and has submitted photographic
capies of orders taken some time ago
from captured craft. This evidence
is not considered conclusive here,
however.
Turing the long drawn om vpy'"
tions following the sinking of the
Lusitania, Secretary Lansing has stat­
ed in general terms nearly all the
postulates which he laid down in to­
day's declaration. It was determined,
however, to gather these into one
compact statement and to elaborate
the state department's views beyond
any possibility of misunderstanding
or double cons-ruction.
An effort is made to differentiate
between an armed ship in a nuetra\
port and the same vessel on the high
seas.
Mr. Lansing insists that the neutral
government is to be the sole judge of
the status of armed merchant ships in
its port, in the absence of any settled
rule of international law. A commis­
sion, or orders from a belligerent gov­
ernment to conduct aggressive regu­
lations, under punishment for failure
to do so, would stamp the vessel as a
warship.

GERMAN CRUISERS DO
Four Killed.
North Lowestosp and Yarmouth
were bombarded by the German cruis­
er squadron which attacked the east­
ern coast of England Tuesday. Pour
persons were killed and twelve
wounded in the attack and consider­
able damage was done.
Berlin reports that, in this raid the
steamer King Stephen was sunk, and
her crew captured and also that a
cruiser and a scout boat were sunk,
and a cruiser set on fire. The Ger­
mans suffered no losses. Great Bri­
tain has acknowledged that two cruis­
ers and a destroyer were hit, but said
no vessel was sunk. It was the King
Stephen which recently refused to
give aid to the crew of the Zeppelin
L-19, while the airship was adrift in
the North Sea.
Another Naval Battle.
A report from Berlin also says that
there was another engagement be­
tween British and German warcraft
off the coast of Flanders Tuesday, in
which a British destroyer was dam­
aged and an auxiliary steamer sunk,
the crew of the latter being made pris­
oners.
London Colchester, Black Water
and other English towns, and a large
British supply depot, at Etaples,
France, were attacked by Zeppelins
Tuesday night, according to Berlin.
London asserts that 1K bombs were
dropped in this raid, but' that no casu­
alties have been reported and that the
damage was slight. Pails says two
British soldiers were killed at Eta­
ples, but that only insignificant ma­
terial damage was done.
In infantry fighting in the Vosges
mountains, Berlin claims the capture
to the northeast of Celles, of French
first and second line trenches, while
to the south of this region around
Senones, the French say they frustrat­
ed a German attack against their posi­
tions.
The regions of Avocourt, Hill SOS,
Esnes and Montzeville, northwest of
Verdun, continue the scene of violent
artillery activity. The aerial corps
of both the French and Germans have
been engaged in lighting In the air or
bomb dropping maneuvers.
No reports of important events
have ben received from any of the
other war theatres.
