Freeing Philippines.
The democratic -majority of the
house committee, in reporting the bill
recently, frankly based its approval of
the Clarke amendment on the ground
that the United States could not hope
-to defend the Philippines from foreign
aggression save at colossal military
expense.
When the caucus convened last night
it soon became evident the members
of the majority party were divided.
Illinois democrats joined with New
Tork and New England democrats in
assailing the plan as a scuttling policy,
violating all the obligations undertak
en by the United States.

plan of casting the Philippines adrift
within the next four years broke up
the, caucus of house democrats last
nignt which was called to put the
party stamp of approval on the in

When the administration leaders
found the Clarke amendment'menaced
with defeat, the party council was
adjourned until t6morrow night. In
the meantime an effort will be made
for a compromise upon which demo
cratic members "can agree.
The Clarke amendment to the bill as
it passed the senate provides for the
liberation of the Philippines from two
to four years after the passage of the
act establishing a greater measure of
self-government than now exists in
the islands. President Wilson gave
his approval to the amendment, and
his refusal to oppose .lt was one of

OFFERED PAY FOR SINKING SHIP
Witness in Trisl Plot 8ays Germsny
Offered |500,000.
New ^York, April 27.—The German
government was prepared to pay $500,
000 each for the destruction of ships
loaded with war supplies for the en
tente allies. Lieutenant Robert Fay of
the German army, on trial in the Unit
ed States court for conspiracy, was
quoted as having informed Carl L. Wit
tig, a witness for the prosecution.
"I asked him," testified Wittlg,
chemical engineer, "If he knew what
$500,000 was, and he replied that mon
ey was no object in this thing."
Wittlg, who declared his sympathies
in the war were with France, told of
informing the French embassy of his
conversations with Fay. The embassy
in turn notified the New York police.
On trial with Fay are his brother-in
law, Walter Scholz, and Paul Daeche.
"Knew Their Business."
Wittlg said he told Fay and Scholz
that in placing bombs on ships with
Which they were unfamiliar they "were
placing innocent people In Jeopardy."
"Scholz declared'," added the wit
ness, "that they knew what they were
doing that Max Breltung was telling
them on which ships ammunition was
being shipped."
Breltung also is under Indictment
for the alleged conspiracy.
Wittlg's disclosures, it was said,
came Just in time to put the police on
the track at the moment a supply of
trinitrotoluol, one of the most power
