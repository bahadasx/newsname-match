London, April 26.-—The Times naval
expert, in discussing the naval en

destroyers attacked the German war
ships after their raid upon Lowestoft,
say#:
"The raid was not undertaken with
wanton risk, but with a definite pur
pose. Possibly it-was a reprisal for
the' British bombardment of Zee
brugge or a reconnaissance to test the
strength and disposition of the Brit
ish squadrons. More likely it was a
part of a larger, formidable under
taking" designed to cover 'operations
of a filibustering character connected
with the trouble in Ireland'. There is
no security against such exploits but
the stay must be brief owing to the
