General New* of 8outh Carolina Collected
and Condensed From The
State Capital That Will Prove ef
Interest to All Our Readers.
Columbia.
v * Copies ot the journal of the house
of representatives for the recent session
became available, the clerk, J.
Wilson Gibbes. having done diligent
and 8Kilf*#*work in compiling the volumt
of nearly 1,400 pages. Mrs. Virginia
Green Moody, the state librarian.
1h dispatching copies to members and
such other persons as are entitled by
law to receive them. Mr. Glbbes has
introduced several innovations, which,
though they devolvod on him much
tedious and arduous labor, make the
book much more practically helpful
and more readily available to those
having occasion to use it.
Most valuable of the new features,
perhaps, is the subject Index, in which
the gist Is given of oach act. Preparation
of this section meant for the clerk
the careful reading and digesting of |
every act. The arrangement serves all ]
iu?? purposes hi view oetter than the
eld method of a mere collocation of
tides.
Another capital improvement Is the
addition of a section wherein may bo
traced easily the history of a bill, resolution
or claim from introduction to
final disposition. There is a useful
nerBonal index of representatives from
which may be ascertained each member's
recoril for tho session. The volume
contains also the usual standard
conveniences. The typography has
been rocaBt into a comely, convenient
and readable dress.
New 60 Hour Law Misunderstood.
Concerning the new 60 hour law for
the textile plants of the state, E. J.
Watson, commissioner Of agriculture,
commerce and industries, said:
"Operatives In some of the mill districts
of the state in some manner
seem to have gotton the idea that the
new 60 hour law. requiring that no
employe except thoee exempted by
law can work longei than 11 hours in
one day or 60 hours in one week,
meant that every mill should shut
down absolutely at the noon hour,,
Such is not the requirement of the
law.
"The law takeB no cognizance whatever
of the time that machinery is
run. It does emphatically require. '
however, that the human machine, the
operative, shall not be worked exceeding
11 hours in one day or 60 hours
in one week. The purpose of the law
Is to protect the individual man or woman
and to require the mill to employ
spare help for the operation of ma- |
chinery In excess of hours. The law i
requires that the time operatives shall i
start and stop work be posted in each
room In the mill on prescribed forms,
and if the operative Is worked exceeding
11 hours any one day or 60 hours
any one week he has the right to complain
immediately to the commissioner
and prosecution will be forthwith instituted
in every Instance.
"Under the law the mill can be run
24 hours out of every day if the management
so desires, but the employment
of the help must be so arranged
that no man, woman or child is work- j
ed exceeding the hours prescribed by
law."

Court to Review Antl-Compaot Act. \
Hearing on the petition of David
B. Henderson of Charleston for an
order to prevent the attorney general
and the insurance commissioner from
enforcing the terms of the anti-compact
fire insurance act was held before
the supreme court.
The petitioner was represented at
the hearing by T. Moultrie Mordecal.
J. N. Nathans and A. T. Smyth of the
Charleston bar. The state officials
were represented by W. H. Townseud
of the Columbia bar and Thomas H.
Peeples. attorney general.
The arguments bj the attorneys for
both sides containpj many points and
authorities.
The demurrer of the attorney general
charged that the petition did. not
state facts sufficient for a onnao of
action.
After hearing the arguments the
supreme court took the case under
advisement.
In the argument by the petitioner's
attorneys it was charged that the
Laney-Odom act violates several sections
of the state constitution.
In his argument to the court the
attorney general stated that the petitioner
"has not shown that he has
been injured or is threatened with
any injury by reason of the enforcement
of the act of 1916 to prevent
tire insurance companies or associations
or partnerships doing a fire insurance
business in this state to enter
into any compact or combination with
any other fire insurance companies,
associations or partnerships, approved
March 2, 1916; and he is not in a position
to ask this court to consider or
determine the constitutionality of this
act. " The attorney general also
stated that the respondents "would j
welcome a decision from the court
construing the act in question and
directing them as to their duty thereunder."
"The provision," said the attorney
general, "for violations of the act is
germane to its subject, and the act
is not to be considered as unconsti- i
tutlonal because there is no allusion
to these provisions in Its title. j
"The fact that penalties are Imposed
for violation of the provisions
of the net does not render these sections
void as being without title; for
it would be a natural complement to
the act regulating the business of insurance
to include any Just and proper
provisions for enforcing the duties
imposed upon the persons and companies
afTocted and to prescribe penalties
for the violation thereof."
Attorneys for the petitioners contended
that the anti-compact law confers
upon the Insurance commissioner j
both legislative and Judicial powers,
"which under the constitution, can
only be respectively exercised by the
legislative and Judicial departments
of the government of the state." It
was also charged that the act deprives
the petitioner of the "property
without due process of law."

SENATE WILL PASS
RURAL CREDITS BILL
PRESIDENT INSISTS THAT IT
SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY
THIS CONGRESS.
FARMERS MUST HAVE HELP
Tillman, Overman, Simmons and Other
Southern Senators Approve Most
Features of Bill.
Washington.?The Senate has gone
;o work on the rural credits bill, a
piece of legislation which President
Wilson insists should be adopted by
this session of Congress. There is
little doubt but that the measure will I
be passed by the Senate within a short
time, now that work has begun.
Senator Simmons was among the |
number talking while the preliminary
discussions were under way. With !
regard to the interest to be charged j
by private institutions he said: "I |
think it is possible to provide in this j
bill as to limit the rate of interest ;
| that those private institutions may |
charge and do it by increasing the j
! security for the bonds they may issue,
and then you would provide a very
strong system."
Senator Overman in commenting
on the proposed legislation said: "I
think rural credits legislation should :
be enacted as early as possible. I do 1
not like some features of the bill now '
before the senate, but most of the :
I provisions are all right. The farmer
| must have better banking arrange- j
meats. I am glad the President has
this legislation on has program."
"The banks are so full of deposits." '
sai?l Senator Tillmon, "that there is j
no where for them to lend their ;
money at a profit except to the farmers.
I am in favor of a system at f
a rate of five or six per cent by I
which loans can be made on long i
time mortgages on real estate."

INVASION OF IRELAND
BY GERMANY IS FAILURE. 1
I
Oaring Attempt to Land Arms on Ireland
to Resist Against England.
London.?A daring attempt by a
German auxiliary to land arms in
Irelnnd for the purpose of resistance I
against England has resulted in the
Hinking of the vessel and the capture
of Sir Roger Casement, a leader of ;
the Separatist faction in Ireland.
The occurrence is without parallel I
In the annals of Erin's -Isle and will
send a shock of concern throughout 1
Great Britain. Though the members
of the Seapratist faction had hailed
the present war ac a golden oppor- j
tunity for Islend to strike for freedom j
from its allegiance to England, the ^
actual attempt will take rank as
one of the most sensational develop- i
ments of the titanic struggle.
It was during the period between I
the afternoon of April 20 and the af- j
ternoon of April 21, says the official j
anouncoment. that the attempt to land
arms and ammunition In Ireland was '
made by a vessel under the guise of a
neutral merchant ship, but in reality a
German auxiliary, in conjunction with
a German submarine.

i no niorgen Post devotes three col- :

which it ridicules his assertions that !
humanity inspires the action of the
United States and assails him for failure
to proceed against Great Britain.
"Truly the tone and contents of the
new Wilson note, and the spirit it
breathes." says the ^lorgen Post,
"make it endlessly difficult for us Germans
to remain calm."

GERMANY OFFERS DYES
LACK OF DYE HAS SERIOUSLY
AFFECTED AMERICAN TEXTILE
MANUFACTURES.
Bernstorff Delivers Note to Lansing
Who is Arranging With England
For Safe Transportation.
Washington.?The German government
has agreed to permit exportation
to the United States of 15,000 tons of
dyestuffs. lack of which has seriously
affected American textile manufacturers.
Notification to this efTect was
contained in a note delivered by Ambassador
von Bernstorff to Secretary
Lansing.
The communication explains that
while Germany refused at first to permit
exportation of dyestuffs unless exchanged
for American goods now excluded
from Germany by the British
blockade, after careful consideration
of the situation it has been seen "that
this blockade has resultod in serious
embarrassment to those American industries
which are in need of dyestuffs."
and the Imperial German Government
now is prepared to make "a
single exception" in permitting exportation
in this instance. It is required
only that the dyestuffs shall be consumed
by Amerieun manufacturers
and not re-exported to Great Britain
or her Allies.

possibility is conceded.

PARRAL INCIDENT
FAR FROM SETTLED
REPORT THAT MEXICAN OFFICIALS
WARNED GEN, PERSHING
TO STOP.
FELIX DIAZ NOW TROUBLES
Starts Revolution Against De Facto
Government.?Diaz Movement Has
Money Backing.
Washington.?While immediate interest
naturally centers in the situation
as to the troops in Mexico there
were renewed indications about the
State Department that a wholly different
aspect of the Mexican problem was
causing growing concern. That is the
movement supposedly headed by Felix
Diaz, nephew of the former Mexican
dictator, for a new revolution against
the de facto Government. None of
the information upon which the uneasiness
rests has been disclosed. It
is known, however, that several Mexicans
in the United States are being
closely watched and it is possible that
some of tbe anti-American feeling in
Chihuahua state which lias met the
troops pursuing Villa may be attributed
to this movement.
It is admitted that official dispatches
had carried as a rumor the
report that Mexican officers had warned
General Pershing not to proceed
south of Parral. It was learned at the
State Department that a report to this
I effect was transmitted some ilavs tie
Sore the 1'arral incident through consular
agents. Mr. Baker insisted that
the warning had made no change in
the department's orders to the border
forces.
It was indicated that a reply to
General Carranza's telegram regarding
the clash at Parral and asserting
that the American Government had
violated his orders and the agreement
with the de facto government in entering
the town would he dispatched
soon. War Department officials say
the report on the incident from General
Pershing. Major Tompkins and
other officers is now complete; It has
been withheld from publication be|
cause of the flat contradiction it contains
of the Mexico City advices from
General Carranza as to the part his ,
j troops played in the lighting. With
this report as a basis, the Parral inci]
dent will be treated as a matter en|
tirely separate from the suggestion of
the de facto government that the
| troops be withdrawn.
RUSSIA CLOSES ARTIC
AND WHITE SEA PORTS.
Purely Military Measure For Purpose
of Movement of Troops.
Washington.?Russia Embassy dispatches
announcing the closing of
Arctic and White Sea ports offer no
explanation. It was said at the Embassy
that the suspension of traffic
will he complete except in the c ase of
vessels carrying government cargoes
and even in that case they can secure
admission to the ports only by special
permit from Petrograd. It is assumed
by officials here that the closure is a
purely military measure incident to
the use of ports for embarkation for
the heavy Russian reinforcements going
forward to France. The necessity
of guarding the troops transports has
obliged the Russian government to
regard as enemy vessels all but government-owned
or chartered ships, and
to reduce to a minimum the danger
