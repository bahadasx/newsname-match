CHAPTER VII.
Marley and Bozzam Plan to Outwit
Sledge.
P RESIDENT MARLEY smiled as
he met Bozzam. The two gen
tlemen agreed the weather was
fine.
"I'm afraid you're too late, Marley,'
laughed Bozzam. "Our subscription
list is ready to close."
"1 have all the street railway stock
l care for," laughed Marley in return
"I only came up to take your meas
ure for the battle."
"It ought not to be so fierce," re
plied Bozzam, in the usually friendly
manner of meu who are about to
cut each other's commercial throats
"There should be room for two good
car systems in this town."
"Not on the same streets," objected
Marley. "Don't you think It rather
foolish to parallel our lines, Mr. Boz
zaiu? The route, as published, looks
like malice to me."
"I have no voice In that matter,"
declared Mr. Bozzam, eying his caller
narrowly. "You should see our ma
jority stockholder about that"
"I see," mused Mr. Marley. "Who
is your principal stockholder?"
"1 believe the gentleman's name is
Sledge—Benjamin F. Sledge," Bozzam
Informed him, with a smile. "Perhaps
you've heard of him."
"Yes, I have," admitted Marley.
whose smile was more or less strained
"Friend of yours, 1 believe." suggest
ed Bozzam, still smiling, ana still
studying Mr. Marley's countenance in
teresfedly.
"Not offensively so." denied Marley
"Indeed!" exclaimed Bozzam, with
a splendid assumption of perplexity
Wou kjnow v I fjnd it ^very difficult to
unravel the personal, political and
commercial relationships of ali you
fellows. Frankly, l have believed un
til uow that you were In on the game."
"Game?" repeated Marley.
"I mean that I thought you were to
benefit by the formation of this hew
company." exclaimed Bozzam with an
apparent trace of confusion.
"Benefit 1" exploded Marley. "Why
it has all but broke me. Do you think
it's any benefit to a man to have his
only valuable holdings reduced from
par to thirty-five?"
r "By George. I'm shocked!" sympa
thized Bozzam. "Why, I thought you
and Sledge were in perfect understand
ing."
"I don't know where you acquired
that absurd impression, but It is en
tirely wrong," asserted Mr. Marley,
with much vehemence. "Mr. Sledge
would do everything in his power to
hurt me."
"And I presume that you would do
him a like favor if you had the op
portunity," grinned Bozzam.
"I would not say that," hastily re
turned Marley, feeling that he had
enough trouble on his bands.
"You're thinking it. though," laugh
ed Bozzam.
Mr. Marley flushed slightly, but kepi
discreetly silent.
"1 thought so," Bozzam chuckled
"Mr. Marley, bow much of the stock
of the reorganized company do you
own?"
"Two thousand six hundred and
twenty-five shares."
"A little over a fourth," commented
Bozzam and drew a sheet of writing
paper toward him, on which he figured
for a moment "To gala control yon
would peed 2.376 shares additional,"
he announced. "How - many of the
stockholders would vote with you In an
emergency ?V
"Not very many," confessed Marley.
"Naturally a share of our trouble is
blamed to me, and I am not very' pop
; ular at present"
"Certainly not" agreed Bozzam
("Fussing with pikers isn'.t safe,.any
how.. You'd better buy the stock." . •'
"Buy it!" protested Marley. "Great
Scott, man, what do I want with
more of it?"
"Would you like to win ont on this
little game of Sledge's?"
"Show me how," demanded Marley.
"How active are you willing to be?"
inquired Bozzam. "Are yon willing to
jump through a hoop?"
*Tfi do anything that is lawful."
•'Then, j-pn'jl..go ..the limit," smiled
Bozzam, "Ypnr first step will be to
buy thosè two thousand odd shards at
thirty-five.. Let's see." ' He figured it
otlt "They will cost you a little over
§83.000." • • .••••. -i
"1 haven't the money," confessed
Marley.. "SJcdge has cleaned me ont
of both cash and credit."
"Borrow it on your stock."
"I can't borrow over twenty on it. ' I
couldn't raise enough on my total un
encumbered stock."
Bozzam walked to the window and
looked down into the street for some
IK tie time, during which Marley watch
d him in silent wonder, struggling
vgainst Ills rising hope.
"I think 1 can raise a loan for you
it twenty," Bozzam reported as the
to
,
I
result of his deliberation. "If that is
uot enough I might have It arranged
to buy the balance needed and vote it
with you."
"But what is the plan?" demanded
Marley. "I don't see wh»it good con
trol of a ruined company is going to do
me nor why I should breast myself
buying worthless stock." k*
"Because Sledge isn't liberal enough
with me," returned Bozzam. "tVhy,
Marley, don't you see that this com
pany of ours is a fake?"
"You don't mean it!" gasped Marloy.
"Did Sledge have you start this, com
pany In order to break me?"
"Oh, hush!" scorned Bozziim. -"He
ilid it to sell the old company oht fran
chises, for the nice little ^quarter of a
million dollars the public has just put
up for stock in your reorganized com
pany. Our stock is pheaiy, strictly
The public has been allowed to buy
fifty thousand of It, we get two hun
dred thousand aud Sledgç seven hun
dred and fifty. The public is the only
person who has put up any money, and
he. gets his back. The qnly business
we'll do Is to sell our franchises and
disband, with a 25 per eçnt dividend.
The public gets twelve-and a half
housand, we get fifty, and Sledge gets
the balance of your quarter of a mil
lion." 4 • ^
He paused to let all the beätity of
that logical little plan sjnk into Mr.
.Marley's inner being.
"Great Scott!" murmured Mr. Mar
ley and wiped his brow. 'ÎBut how can
we stop him?" j -
"Get control of the company. Call a
special meeting. WbenÜwe offer to
sell you our franchises sjpind pat and
refuse to pay more than §50,000 for
the franchises. You caq defy us to
build and make a fine grattd stand play
out of it when you knfow that we
won't. We'll accept fifty thousand,
and then you juggle it tojtlîp Mood son
and Timbers and me a hundred thou
sand on the side. Yon'vji saved your
company a hundred thousand, we've
dragged down what we dbght to have
for our work, Sledge g^ts the book,
and your stock bounces up to par.
Why. man, you'll not otfiy be where
you were before, but yoa'U clean np

In answer to the bell Cashier Davis
came in with the pomposity of the
owner of the mint mingled with the
obsequiousness of a messenger boy.
"Frank Marley." rumbled Sledge ac
cusingly. "He's got money. Where
did he get it?'.'
"Not here, sir," smiled Mr. Davis,
rubbing ills fish fat hands together.
"Find out," directed Sledge, and Da
vis took his sleek white sideburns and
his white waistcoat out of the room.
"He's using cash, even in the pay
ment of his grocery bills," supplement

both palms upward. .'T.ve had stuff In

"They'd make a noise," objected
Sledge, glaring down at the cuspidor,
which, in this room, took the place of
the hand hole in the gate as a source of
inspiration.
"How about Bozzam?"
"I've tried my best to trace some
thing back to his crowd, but I can't
^nd a connection any place."
Sledge was silent for a moment.
"Bozzam's In It," he said decisively.
"I don't like to think so," defended
Bendix. "He seems to work clean."
"You found him," explained Sledge.
"He's In it He's a crook."
Even Bendix grinned.
"I don't deny that, but he's too wise
to start anything with you. That's
what I bank on."
"He thinks I'm on the pan," judged
Sledge. "He's a stranger."
Davis came in.
"We have telephoned all the banks,"
he reported. "None of them has made
any recent loans to Mr. Marley nor
have ariÿ checks been drawn in bis fa
vor."
"Hunh!" grunted Sledge. He stolid
ly walked out of the office, followed
by Bendix, and climbed Into his wait
ing runabout, over which the crossing
policeman stood guard. "Don't buy
any more stock," he directed Bendix
and drove ofL "Sell it"
He strode Into the offices of the trac
tion company and stopped at Hunt's
desk.
"Marley drawn any money here?" he
wanted to know.
"His salary," replied Hunt fawning
servilely on the big man who stood at
his side.
"Is he selling any stock?"
"Not that I know of, sir?"
"Making any flash?"
"Not particularly. He has been whis
tling." *■
"Making any threats 7"
"Not that I heard."
"Hunh!" aud Bledge turned from the
desk. "Anybody in with him?"
"I think hl 3 daughter, sir," smirked
Hunt "and Mr. Glider, unless they
have gone out the other way."
Sledge looked down at his lapel. The
red rose was an excellent specimen ex
cept that it had one straggling petal in
which was a worm hole. He jerked off
that petal and walked unannounced
into Marley's office, pausing just inside
the door, struck dumb by a tableau be
ing enacted at the opposite entrance.
Bert Glider, In the act of. departing,
was kissing Molly goodby, and Marley
at bis desk, was looking on uncon
cernedly. Bert grinned impudently at
Sledge and departed. Molly grinned
antalizingly at him and sat in the big
caflfer chair opposite ber father. Mar
ley grinned cheerfully and offered bin»
a cigar.
"Fine weather," he observed.
"Who give out the dope about extend
ing the Ridgewood avenue line?"
Sledge gruffly wanted to know.
"I did," returned Marley calmly,
thought it might help the price of my
stock. It's been going down of late."
"Who gave you the word?"
"I didn't need it," Marley reminded
him. "I'm still president of the road,
you know."
"I've called it off," Sledge informed
him. "You got no franchise."
"I beg your pardon," Marley smiling
ly interrupted. "The original fran
chise granted a line to the end of Grace
street. When it was cut through to
connect with Ridgewood avenue the
authorization of the cut and all the
condemnation proceedings were for an
extension of Grace street."
"May I tell Mr. Sledge what we in
tend to do out there?" Molly pleasantly
inquired.
"I don't mind," granted Mr. Mar
ley, beaming upon his child.
"We plan to carry out the original
Idea of building an amusement park
on the Porson property and to drop
the Lincoln road project if the stock
• holders don't object at their meeting
tomorrow," she happily told him. "Mr.
Glider thinks it a much better loca
tlon. Shall you be at the meeting, Mr.
Sledge?"
In reply be chuckled at her.
"You're a corkerl" he complimented
her.
"You don't own much stock any
more, do you?" she went on, delighted
with her catechism.
"Enough to stick around," he re
minded her. "Marley, are you figur
ing to put something over at this meet
Ing?"
"Are you?" returned Marley blandly.
"Hunh!" Sledge half laughed. "Mol
ly, my Bob is matched against the
champion forty pound bull of Chicago
tomorrow night. 1 can arrange for
you to see the scrap without these
roughnecks getting a peek at you."
"Thank you," she replied. "I'm sure
I can't come, however. I've néVer seen
a real dog fight, and I don't want to
see one. But I hone Bob wins."
"He'll win," declared Sledge confi
dently. "He's never been licked yet."
"Everybody gets it some time, don't
they?" Molly dimpled up at him.
"Uh-hunh!" he gruffly assented.
Full of thought, he went over to see
Bozzam, who now had an office In the
newest palace of commerce.
'.'Ready for the meeting tomorrow?"
he Inquired.
"Quite," replied Bozzam, who, when
with Sledge, was sparing of words.
"Is the slate fixed?"
"Sure! Bozzam, I got your record."
"Yes?" returned. Bozzam carelessly.
"Yon served two bits before you got
educated, a one year and à two
stretch." - ~
"Yes," agreed Bozzam, still care
lessly.
'"Well, if you try to pull anything
here it'll be ten."
Mr. Bozzam laid down the pencil
with which be had been tapping light
ly on his desk and leaued slightly for

American says, "I can plod If I can

this country of vast dreams and huge I
fulfillments Idleness is a rusty sword !

more excruciating. The resiliency of I

Grasshopper Glacier.
Grasshopper glacier, at tlie headwa
ters of the East and West Rosebud riv
ers In the Beartooth mountains of
Montana, derived Its name from the
myriads of grasshoppers Imbedded in
the perpetual Ice of that neighborhood.
Many of the specimens are as perfect
ns If preserved in alcohol for exhibi
tion. In the opinion of scientists who;
made a first hand study of the glacier
the insects were caught in a periodic
southward flight and succumbed to the
cold In their attempt to cross the moun
tain range. The huge ice mass, under
whose crust the grasshoppers are bur
ied. is virtually under the shadow of
Granite peak, 12.842 feet high, the high
est in Montana. Only recently has its
existence as a perpetual glacier been
verified, though as long ns forty years
ago it was traditionally known in early
Montana mining camps and mountain
towns. It was considered then merely
a fanciful tale of pioneer prospector*
and fur trappers who had penetrated
to the upper reaches of this branch of
the rugged Rockies.—Argonaut

Making a Rug "Antique."
How "genuine antique rugs" are
manufactured and prepared for Euro
pean and American markets is told by
a writer in the National Geographic
Magaziue who visited Bagdad.
The shopping streets seem like tun
nels. he writes. They are arched over
head with brick to keep out the heat.
Thus they run. like subways, up and
down the bazaar quarter. Through
those long, stifling, faintly lighted tun
nels throngs the eternal crowd of men.
mules and camels.
Often you will see a fine rug lying
flat in the filth of a narrow street,
ground beneath the tramp of men and
beasts, but there is method in this.
Foreigners make oriental nigs, bright
and new, h» Persia and sell them
through Bagdad Since an "old rug'
is worth more, wily brokers have hit
on this shameful way to make a new
rug look old.

This Is one of the very newest sport
suits—a saffron colored silk Jersey cut
on beautiful lines. The skirt closes

loose coat Flense notice how smart
are the collar and cuffs of brown glas
ed leather, which Is also used to face
the slit pockets. The string belt Is an
other Interesting feature. With thla
elegant outfit goes a brown chip sailor
simply trimmed with a soft bow and
band of satin ribbon. The whole de
sign speaks of simple elegnnee.
FOOTGEAR.
The ultra smart sports shoes exhibit
the instep and toe strap effects. The
newest thing hi oxfords for use at the
southern spring resorts is low of heel
rounded of toe, in white suede, toe
strapped and rather heavily trimmed
with the finest of black patent kid.
This model is repeated In white and
tan, in ali white and in all tan. Many
of the high topped laced shoes in white
suede or glace kid show both the in
step and the toe strap simulations.
The reason for their vogue is not far
to seek. They shorten the apparent
length of the feet. Another vogue in
boots is tlie high topped, front laced
model in African brown suede.
