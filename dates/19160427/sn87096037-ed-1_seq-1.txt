is one of the most won
derful inventions of the
age. It is absolutely
unique. Never before
has there been speed
without harm. Never before have women had any
thing which REALLY made dirt disappear as quickly,
as harmlessly, as EASILY as with this extraordinary
dirt loosener. It does HOURS work in MINUTES.
It positively will not fade colored clothes—shrink or
harden woolen, and will not rot or weaken lace cur
tains so they tear easily, but keeps them STRONG
besides absolutely clean.

Safe Medicine for Children
"Is it safeV" is the first question to
be considered when buying cough med
icine for children. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy has long been a favor
ite with mothers of young children as
it contains no opium or other narcotic,
and may be given to a child as confi
dent as to an adult. It is pleasant to
take, too, which is of great import
ance when a medicine is to be given
to young children. This remedy is
most effectual in relieving coughs,
colds and croup. Obtainable every
where.— Ad v-

Built for the
Business Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles 'an|
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able t6
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the teni
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coming out of the ground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearance the Dort merits a careful'investi
gation of the Business Farmer.
See the Dort
at our
rooms.
