METHODIST CHURCH
REJECTS PROPOSAL
FOR NEGRO BISHOPS
Majority Affirmative Vote For Proposition
Given By Conferences,
But Necessary Two-Thirds
Not Reached.
i
Chicago, April 21.?The Methodist
Episcopal Church has rejected the
Proposltiofl, for negro bishops, according
to an announcement today by
Dr. Joseph B. Hingeley, secretary of
the general Conference. The resolution
submitted to the various conferences
received an affirmative vote of
4, 921 against a negative vote of 3,481,

essary two thirds.
Dr. Hingley also announced that the
Wilmington proposition giving bishops
the right of veto in* constituting issues
was lost by a majority of 1,571 ministers
and 960 laymen.
The Colorado proposition granting
honorary privileges to retirad ministers
hnd absentee voting on constitutional
matters had a majority of 2,012
and will become law by favorable action
of the general conference at Saratoga
Springs.
These three questions have been vot?

Had the resolution for bishops for
races and languages tarried, n*egro
, bishops would have been provided for
work among negro people.

REMEMHEHIVG THE ALAMO
America Knows No More Thrilling
Tale of Heroism Than the Story
of How This Brave Band Died
"Thermopylae had Its messenger!
of death, but the Alamo had none."
Xot a defender of the old ston<
mission house and forties, which
s.ands today in San Antonio, Texas
sarrived to tell the story when th?
iamo fell 80 years ago before 4,00(
I frenzied Mexicans. The battle 017
itiiat bad its origin in that blood
soaked compound of scarred walls
>aud its defenders' ashes has nevei

i "Remember the Alamo-" ran th<
word through Texas, and Texas re
membered.. At San Jacinto, Texai
troops, 1,100 of them, shouted to on<
another hoarsely, "Remember the Al
iamo,". and men remembered ho*
i Davy Crockett had died, Ringed
around with dead Mexicans, ant
("Jim" Bowie, and Colonel Travis;
jand at San Jacinto the power ol
(Mexico Was broken forever as far ai
Texas was concerned.,
i Texas remembers the Alamo today

I bloodshed run up and down the bori

hot wonder that hatred of the Mexican

member the Alamo."
Texas, settled by hardy frontiers'
inon and backwoodsmen, had revoltet
against the rule of Santa Anna, die
tator of Mexico, and declared itsel)
independent. That independence i
won without aid of the United States
and the most heroic struggle of th<
nght was the Alamo.
The Alamo was an old stone anf
'tiooe mission house, built in th<
early Eighteenth Century and usee
occasionally by Spaniards and Mexicans
as a fort and arsenal. Then
when Santa Anna came up with hit
%ut)o over 600 miles of dfesert in
February, 1836. the little handful ol
Americans, loO strong, under Col
V.'iLiam Travis, made their stand. 11

Amid smoke and the flame and
crash of rille firing, lunging of knives,
the swinging of clubbed guns, the
fight reeled bacl^ and forth among

ranks there hung a pack of Santa

leathery skin of his face and a Mexican
bullet had gone through his
k cheek. And with his back against a
j well, his rifle long past using, he mowed
L with hand ax and cutlass, clearing a
r space around him. Lancers held him
. at bay while a squad of Santa Anna's
I riflemen was assembled, and with a
j volley brought him to the ground. One
. story goes that even the tongh-flbered
old man was not killed, but at Santa
Anna's orders was shot to death by a
I liring squad. Since not one defender of
the Alamo survived, and history is det
pendent for its knowledge of details
upon the story of two Mexican women
L and a negro boy, it is impossible to tell
with ceituiuty the last details of that
, tight in which wild courage flamed high
to the very last.
The Mexican General had the bodies
of the fort's defenders piled in a heap
with cliappurul ami timber west of th
Alamo and burned.

And Alamo's dread memory the Texan
steel shall whet
And Fame shall tell their deeds who

the big war ?nd our Ambassadors and
, Consuls have iieen having a very busy
time keeping things straight for near;
ly all the belligerents.
It would be safer, however, for war
i to be precipitated between the two
Nations with a severance of diplomatic
relations than if they were still on
; speaking terms, and'' this is the great
i reason that men are hoping that nothing
will occur that will result in the
i return of diplomatic officials to their
respective/lands. Things would be
strained in both countries and people
and officials wouldn't be so inclined
to fight shy of offending the other fellow
as in the days of diplomatic dealings.
Austria-Hungary broke off diplomatic
relations with Mexico in 1867, following
the execution of /'Emperor"
Maximilian, an Austrian archduke,
and until the late '90s their former
relations were not resumed. Still, nobody
thought of doing any fighting.
Peru and Chile have no diplomatic
representatives today and Germany
and Italy are enjoying what is called
"suspended intercourse-^- but still they
are not at war, aitnougn Dotn are on
i different sides in the same war.
i If the United States should break
, off with Germany for the purpose of
going on record as . disapproving of
Germany's conduct, it isn't at all likely
that they would become good
friends again until after the European
i war is over. It would also eliminate
any chances that the President of this
Republic might have in acting as a
i peacemaker between the present belligerents
as Colonel Roosevelt, when
President, did when he "helped to
straighten out strife between Japan
i and Russia.
If there should be war Germany
i and the United Stat? {following a
severance of diplomatic relations by
reasou of a war like act on the part
of one or both Nations, one of the first
official acts of the United States, in all
^ likelihood, would be to seize the many
big German steamshlpsf now Interned
in American ports.
I'ossihlv. tlio TTnltwl Sfntps would
not be obliged to send her warships
abroad, as the German Navy is tied
t up and the combined fleets of her ene?
rules will try hard to keep them where
i they are, and perhaps it wouldn't be
i necessary to raise an army to defend
I itself from attack, but ij; is very like
ly that this country wopld use all its
resources in furnishing guns and ammunition
supplies for tl?e Allies that
might tend to hasten tile end of the
war.
The United States Jtould use the
' German ships that she! would seize
, for the purpose of casing supplies
to Germany torpedoed 9^1, she would
have so many ships le&V.t the end of
the war, as it is understo >d the intern

of tht struggle. *
FARTHEST NORTH RAILROAD
Projected for Finnish Lapland to Develop
Iron One Deposit*.
(From The American Contractor.)
A railroad is projected for Finnish
Lapland in order to make available
deposits of iron ore in that region.
The first portion to be built, if the
scheme materializes, probably will be
from the village of Rovanlemi, connected
by rail already with the port
of Kemi, on the gulf of Bothnia, and
Sukuvaara, 87 miles distant From
Sukuvaara further extensions of the
line may be built to the mouth of the
Neida River, on the Arctic ocean,
whence Finland would be enabled to
export iron ore all the year round.
Eleven miles of this link would be
in Norweigian territory. The total
length of the line, which would be one
of the farthest north in the world,
would be 280 miles.

there were renewed indications
about the State Department today'
that a wholly different aspect of the
Mexican problem was causing growing
concern. That Is the movement supposedly

of the former Mexican dictator, foi
a new revolution against the de facto
Government None of the information
upon which the uneasiness rest
has been disclosed. It Is known, however,
that several Mexicans in the

Diaz interests were seeking to under

various commanders. Should (clear
indications of this become apparent
the attention of General Carranza

that the warning had made no change
