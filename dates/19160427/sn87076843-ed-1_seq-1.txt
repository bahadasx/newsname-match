If you arc repairing any fenc
ing this spring it should he huilt
from good end and corner posts
to render the maximum service,
sas Bulletin No. 321, U. S. Dept.
of Agriculture. The corner posts
should he placed 'solidly in the
ground so they cannot ho heaved
by frosts or drawn over hy the
pull of the fence. The wire should
he strung tightly to the end posts
hut it should not be tightly
stapled to the middle or line posts.
It should be fastened so that each
wire can move in a horizontal
direction to allow for expansion
and contraction due to changes in
temperature and to distribute even
ly any pressure on the fence. A
barbed wire placed on top of the
fence prevents stock from crowd
ing down the fence.
Right now is the time to begin
the campaign against the fly. The
following are a few ways by which
this pest can be controlled :
1. Screen the house.
2. Keep all the premises free
from fly attracting material such
as garbage, slops and manure.
3. Screen all privies on the
premises. Have in every closet a
keg of slaked lime and use freely
to dry up the closet material.
4. When cleaning out the sta
bles do not spread the manure
over the lot but haul directly to
the field. If tins is not possible,
put it in a heap and spray every
two weeks with arsenite of soda
solution. This solution is poison
ous and must be kept away from
feed stuff. The eggs of the fly are
laid on stable manure and in priv
ies; but thrive best on horse
manure. Each female lays about
125 eggs of -which 75 are females.
In ten days after the eggs arc
layed the fly is full grown.
In getting the farm machinery
ready for spring operations, Prof.
II. C. Rauisower, of the Agricul
tural Engineering Dept., Ohio
State University, urges that spe
cial attention be given to the lub
rication of all wearing parts. "A
full oil can to every machine" is
the way he states it. Especially on
new machinery and the farm trac
tor does the use of oil become im
portant. Make sure that all oil
holes, wells, pumps, grease cups
and bearings are thoroly cleaned
of dirt, grit, paint, and foreign
matter before the holes are filled
so that waste matter can not be
carried into the bearings. Clean
wool or cotton placed in cups will.11""!8 proof "I have had wonderful

At the election on Tuesday the
People of Perrysburg Village School
district voted in favor of the issue
of S'11.000 in bonds for the purpose

The vote stood 298 for and 86
against the proposition almost 4

On the occasion of the first elec

utterly failed to take the people in

publicity campaign and uthe Journal
then commented on the failure by
saying 'It pays to advertise "

"SNIVIL" SERVICE LAW
Savors Too Much of Monarchial
Form of Government.
There is to be an active cam
paign waged in Ohio between now
and the time of the election in No
vember for the abolishment of the
present civil service law.
The law is believed to be unfair,
dictatorial and not calculated to
meet the best interests of the peo
ple and arguments setting forth
this fact will be presented from
time to time.
No good reason exists why it
should be coutinued. It was placed
in tho constitution by but a small
percentage of the voters and they
rested under a misapprehensian as
to its merits.
Petitions to bring about a refer
endum vote are to bo circulated;
publicity is to be obtained through
the newspapers and speakers are
to go into every portion of the
state declaring against the law
which keeps many incompetents
in office and excludes others far
