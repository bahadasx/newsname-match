Department.
OBREGON ON WAY
Conference Between Mexican
and American Officers to Be
gin at Border Tomorrow.
Washington, April 27 Secretary
Baker today telegraphed Generals
Scott and Funston to proceed from
San Antonio to EI Paso for the con
ference with General Obregon.
Consul Silllman at Saltillo wired
that General Obregon had left Tor
rcon last night for Juarez. General
Obregon changed his planB to go first
to Piedras Negras. opposite Eagle
Pass. By going direct to Juarez by
way of Chihuahua, Obregon risked a
possible interference from Villa fol
lowers. Officials expected General Obregon
will reach Juarez tonight General
Scott and General FunBton are ex
pected to reach El Paso late today or
tomorrow.
Government Delays Sending Fletcher.
The government is delaying send
ing Henry P Fletcher, the new am
bassador to Mexico, to join General
Carranza until conditions become
more settled It was suggested today
that Mr, Fletcher might not proceed
to Mexico until after the expedition
is withdrawn
Reports that Americans in Durango
were preparing to flee because of
anti-American demonstrations lacked
confirmation. Consul Hanna at Tor
reon reported conditions Improved
there since General Trevlno took
charge although food supplies were
short.
"San Antonio, Apnf27'. The coriTer-v
ences between Generals Scott, Fun
ston and Obregon will take place at
El Paso or Juarez, It was definitely
announced at departmental headquart
ers today Generals Funston and
Scott expect to leave for El Paso to
night, Obregon Coming to Juarer.
El Paso, Texas, April 27. Tho con
ference between Generals Scott, Fun
ston and Obregon will be hold In El
Paso, Juarez or "this vicinity" accord
ing to tho statement of army offi
cials today. This was confirmed by
Mexican Consul Andres Garcia, who
said that "General Obregon Is coming
to Juarez."
Consul Garcia could not state when
General Obregon would arrive.
General Obregon's exact locality
was not divulged by Mexican officials
hut, from other sources, It was learn
ed that he probably was at or nearing
Chihuahua. The run vfrom Chihuahua
to Juarez under ordinary conditions
consumes from ten to twelve hours.
General Obregon might, therefore,
reach Juarez by tonight
It Is not regarded as" likely, how
ever, that ho will leave Chihuahua
until ho learns that Generals Scott
and Funston aro well on their way to
El Paso.
That the American representatives
to the conference were in ignorance
of Obregon's movements was evi
denced late last night when they were
in communication with El Paso by
long diBtance telephone,-.sklng as to
the whereabouts of the Mexican min
ister of war.
General Gavlra, commander of the
Juarez garrison, received a message
from General Obregon today saying
ho would arrive In Juarez tomorrow.

Btory. Other truckmon said that
snipers' bullets had struck their ma
chine on the trip north but that thoy
had been unable to locate the source
of tho firing.
Vllllsta Prisoners Held. .
Some speculation was expressed
here today as the result of the fail
ure to arrive of Villlsta prisoners re
ported to be on the way to Colum
bus. It was assumed, however, that
most of these are being held at vari
ous bases that the American military
authorities may quiz them thoroughly.
A report reaching here today 6ald
that four prisoners held at Casas
Grandes were shot several days ago
In an attempt to escape, but It could
not be confirmed at military head
quarters here.
While no new reports were receiv
ed concerning the movements of Colo
nel George A. Dodd's command after
Its victory over Vllllstas at Toma
chlc several days ago, tactical experts
here believe that after a short stop
at the Mlnaca base to obtain supplies,
the cavalry command again took up
the pursuit of the band. The bandits,
numbering more than the Americans,
were last reported In the mountain
wilderness east of Mlnaca and mili
tary men here admitted that they
would not be surprised to hear of a
second engagement.
