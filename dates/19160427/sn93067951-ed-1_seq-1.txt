Town Council Meets
The second meeting of the new
town council was held Tuesday
evening.
There was a full attendance
and some important business
was transacted.
Mr. J. II. Abbott was appointed
policeman.
An ordinance governing the
parking of cars on Main street was
passed. Hereafter cars mav be
parked on the south side of
Main street between Odom Bros,
store and the county jail and
from the City Market as far west
as is needful; on the north side
of Main street they may be
parked west from the post office
and between the store of Mr. B.
0. Moore and the courthouse.
Cars are to be turned head-in
toward sidewalk and not parallel
thereto.
The council has officially set
the week of May 1st as cleanup
week. The missionary societies
of the various churches have
appointed committees to wait on
the mayor and council and to as.
sist in any way possible. There
is no use talking, Chesterfield
may as well make up her mind
to the fact that she is going to
be cleaned up.
A ntnmntkilo A
nttlUt'lll
The third accident on the
streets of Chesterfield within a
month came near being a serious
one. Mr. L. K. Haley and Mr.
Smith Oliver wore in collision
and both escaped injuary by a
narrow margin.
The mules hitched to a wagon
of the Standard Oil Co., escaped
damaged by tho quick exercise
of their mulish intelligence.
They sidestepped with alacrity.
The streets of Chesterfield are
becoming too crowded with cars
for the further continuance of
haphazard methods of traffic control
without serious risk of life
and property.
This fact is fully realized by
the new city council and they
propose to enact ordinacen governing
traffic; especially on Main
street, and to see that th< y are
obeyed.
