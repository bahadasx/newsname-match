Miss Carrie Locke and Edith
Wilds, of Ft. Littleton, visited in
tne home of John Gillis on Mon-
Barnharts' Sentence Delayed.
The News has already told that
the Barnhart boys were found
guilty at the March term of court
on the third count in the indict
ment; that their attorney, John
R. Jackson, asked leave of the
Court to present reasons why the
boys should have a new trial, and
that the .Court set Thursday,
April 20th to hear the reasons.
Last Thursday was the day set,
and Judge McPherson, and As
sociates Stigers and Mellott were
in court to listen to the argu
ment.
The third count in the indict
ment upon which the jury found
the boys guilty, in part reads a9
follows:
"That the said Walter
Barnhart and Harry Barn
hart, afterwards to wit, on
the day and year aforesaid
(October 14, 1915) at the
County and within the juris
diction aforesaid, with force
and arms, in and upon one
Arthur Barnhart, in the peace
of God and the said Common
wealth, then and there being,
feloniously, wilfully and of
their malice aforethought,
did make an assault, and him
the said Arthur Barnhart, did
then and there cut. stab, and
wound, with intent hinthe
said Arthur Barnhart, feloni
ously, wilfully and of their
malice aforethought kill and
murder."
The principal point3 in the ar
gument of Attorney Jackson,
which lasted an hour and a half,
was:
Did the evidence at the trial
show beyorrd a reasonable doubt
that Walter Barnhart and Harry
Barnhart did intend to kill Ar
thur Barnhart?
From ail the evidence in the
case, wa3 the jury justified in
finding that Walter and Harry
intended to kill Arthur?
That he might .have time for
careful and mature deliberation,
the Judge took the papers home
with him and will file his opinion
on the 10th day of May, when
there will be an adjourned ses
sion of court.
In addition to the above mat
ter, the Chambersburg Trust Co.,
was appointed guardian of E.
Carl, Theodore M., and Richard
W. Fraker, minor children of
Geo. Fraker, deceased, to give
bond in the sum of $400 for
funds of each ward.
Petition of citizens of Todd
township was presented asking
the appointment of a supervisor,
and the Court appointed Floyd
Everhart to fill unexpired term.

Wringer.
Gladys Beryl, the little three-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank E. Mellott, who now live
near Bloomdale, Ohio, met with
a very serious accident Tuesday
forenoon of last week. Mrs. Mel
lott was washing with a power
washer run by a gas engine, an:
had just gone outside the wash
house for more clothes. ' Hearing
a scream she ran in. In some
way the child had been caught in
the revolving wringer. And her
hand and arm had run through
between the rolls, almost to the
elbow, The frightened mother
quickly reversed the machine
and backed the little arm out,
and quickly summoned a doctor.
it was iouna tnat th arm was
broken half way .between the el
bow and wrist, and that the
bones in the fingers end hand
were all crushed. At first it was
feared that amputation would be
necessary; but circulation has be
gun and it is thought that the
aim can be saved. The arm is
so badly swollen that it has been
impossible to get tbe bones set
This is hard luck. It will be re
membered that just about a year
ago Mr. Mellott had both arms
broken, when the team he was
driving ran off. v
Information Waited.
Two weeks ago last Saturday
evening Mrs. James II. Kendal
and her sister-in-law Miss Ruth
Kendoll were driving home after
having attended the evangelistic
services in the Presbyla r ian
church in town. Somebody in
another buggy came up behind
them driving at a furious rate
and in dashing by them, caught
one hind wheel of the buggy in
which the ladies were driving,
crushing it and tearing it entire
ly off throwing the ladies out,
Had it not been for the gentle
ness of the horse the ladies were
driving, there is no tolling just
what might have happened. As
it was, the ladies were obliged to
leave the buggy and get home
the best way they could. The
gentlemen" who did the mis
chief, did not halt to apologize
or offer any assistance, but drove
on as though they thought they
had done a real smart thing.
JNow, Mr. Kendall nas some
real good" money that he is
willing to part with for informa
tion that will lead to the arrest
and conviction of the guilty par
ties.

MEMORIAL DAY AT WARPORDSBL'RG.
Under the Ans'pices of the Odd Fellows
Arrangements Are Being Perfect
ed for a Great Time.
At a recent meeting of War
fordsburg Lodge, I. 0. 0. F., it
was decided that the lodge should
take the initiative, and invite the
cooperation of other fraternal or
ganizations, Sunday schools, and
people generally to join in mak
ing the coming Memorial Day,
Tuesday, May 30th, one of the
biggest days the old Burg has
ever seen. The spirit of nationa
patriotism coupled with local pride
ought to be sufficient to make ev
erybody within reach, so arrange
their work, that they can take a
day off and join in this great na
tional holiday. Atnotimesincethe
great Civil War has the Country
so much felt the need of the cut
tivation of a spirit of patriotism
and the subservience of all sped
al interests orpolitical dominance,
Let everybody turn out in token
of appreciation of the men who
threw themselves into the breach
to save the country's honor in the
time of its dire peril, and to show
to the present generation that
valor and heroism count for some'
thing even to-day.
Frank Ranek, Andrew Bishop
and Job T. Barnhart have been
appointed a committee to pre
pare a program, and to effect
such an organization as shall in
sure success to tho project. But
it would scarcely be fair to ex
pect that they Rhould do all the
work, nor should you vait unti
iney come to see you. iou see
them. They want your sugges
tions. They want your help.

years her parents conducted the
tavern" at the Crossings, and
later the Mountain House or
Mcllvains as it was then known
all over the country. They were
at the latter place during the
Civil War, when the rebels were
in Chambersburg and McCon
nellsburg, and Miss Lottie re
calls many exciting incidents
connected with those times,
While she has been a great suf
ferer from rheumatism for many
years, she otherwise, has remark
ably good health, and her mind
is as clear as a bell. She is a
great reader not only of the
Bible, from which she gets daily
comfort but from newspapers
and magazines she keeps abreast
of the times and is remarkably
well posted on current events.
Being of a kindly disposition
and coming in contact with
many prominent people in her
time, she has endeared herself to
a host of friends who always
bear in mind her birthday anni
versaries, un ner last birthday
n her room, were 84 beautiful
carnations and a large bouquet of
daffodils which she appreciated
more than words can express.

DRUNKENNESS.
Little Talks on Health and fljgienc by
Samuel C. Dixon, M. LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Man's getting drunk is to be
likened unto the opening of the
draft doors under the fire-box of
a locomotive and generating a
high steam pressure, opening the
throttle and letting everything
go until the machine is on a mad
race through town and country,
crushing whatever comes in the
way, let it be man or beast, or
maybe it will smash itself to a
helpless mass.
If the tracks are clear the ma
chine may run until its fire box,
the stomach, burns out or a steam
pipe, a blood vessel, bursts or a
valve gives way and the locomo
tive or the human body becomes
a useless wreck and a burden in
the way.
In the case of the locomotive
the suffering is confined to the
living beings it runs down, but in
man not only the beings he in
jures or destroys but he himself
suffers after he ha3 irreparably
injured his physical body and
mental powers. He may lose an
arm, cripple his stomach, blood
vessels or mind, and become a
charge on bis family or the com
munity. In the case of the locomotive it
is only a piece of uncontrolled in
animate machinery, but in . man
it often means setting to run
amuck a piece of the most inven
tive animal life ever recorded in
history. When drunk he may
spend his last cent on foolish
things and leave a hungry fami
ly at his home. He may kill his
best friend, violate a trust, throw
a bomb, send a great passenger
ship to the bottom of the sea, or
even incite a war of Nations.
A drunken man is the most
dangerous demoralizing factor in
civilized life. The wild beast of
the forest is a plaything in com
parison. He sets all laws at
naught and becomes an instru
ment of the devil. Man craved
by any kind of mental over-excr-tion
or drunkenness, like a rabid
beast, is a menace to every one
with whom he comes in contact.
The wild dash of the mind and
body during the stage of over
stimulation may be fascinating
to the individual but, when the
inevitable reaction comes, death
may ensue or sometimes that
which is worse, returning con
sciousness bring a realization of
a horrible crime committed nev
er to be undone. At least body
and mind are weakened and less
able to control the insane desire
to exhilarate again and again un
til untimely death ends a life
that might have been a boon to
humanity in some useful rath
over which its race might have
een run.
Some temperaments become
sloth-like and are oblivious to the
past and reckless as to what is to
come. In such the harm to them
and others comes through netr-
ected duties.
Drunkenness is over-stimula
tion that destroys normal condi
tions, it may even be occasioned.
by the psychology of a crowd.
Lhere are various stimulants
that will make drunk.
The Soil Is Starved For Lime.
'On many Pennsylvania farms
all that stands between failure
and success is an application of
lime," says L. W. Lighty, soil
and crop expert of the Pennsyl
vania Department of Agriculture.
"Many thousands of acres in
the State will not grow the clov
ers successfully," continued Mr.
Lighty, "because of the lack of
lime in the soil. To lime an acre
of ground costs from two to six
dollars and one crop of medium
red clover will pay for this sev
eral times over. Besides the
clover growth puts the" soil into
a condition favorable to grow the
cereals and other grasses.
"Lime is not a panacea for all
troubles, but if there is, a defi
ciency of lime tmd the soil is sour,
the clover will not thrive and on
land where clover is a failure ev
erything else will be a failure by
and by."
