97TH ANNIVERSARY
Of the I. O. O. F. Lodge Observed with
Fitting Exercises at Masonic
Hall Last Evening.
Inspiring Talk Given by Attorney
Loevinger of St. PaulPleasing
Program Was Carried Out.
On April 26, 1819, in Baltimore,
Maryland, the first Odd Fellow lodge
was instituted, and the 97th anniver
sary of the establishment of this well
known benevolent organization was
observed with fitting exercises at the
Masonic hall last evening. The local
I. O. O. F. lodge and the Rebekahs
were in charge, and as usual met with
success.
A program of more than ordinary
merit had been prepared for the occa
sion, and it was carried out most
pleasingly.
Noble Grand Henry Marpe presided
and after brief introductory remarks
by him had been given, the High
School orchestra was called upon for
a selection, and it responded in a
manner that delighted all. A reading
by Miss E\a Ross was next, and the
young lady did so well that another
recitation was insisted upon. After
a well executed piano solo by Mrs.
Geo. Townsend, who also responded
to an encore, Miss Marguerite Byers
favored those present with a vocal
solo rendered in her usual pleasing
style, being accompanied on the piano
by Miss Lola Scheen. Miss Byers
was also recalled, and then a quartet
composed of Nathan Peterson, Lemuel
Briggs, Jay Winsor and Jos, Kahiler
contributed a song to the evening's en
tertainment. After another selection
by the High School orchestra, Attor
ney Gustavus Loevinger of St. Paul,
the speaker of the evening, was intro
duced.
Mr. Loevinger took for his sub
ject, "Oddfellowship and Peace," and
his address was an able and eloquent
effort. He briefly dwelt upon the
stupendous, appalling and devastating
conflict that engulfs Europe at the
present time the internal dissensions
and strife among individuals notice
able in all nations and climes, and
stated that those grand principles
friendship, love and truththat form
the er foundation of the Independ
ent Order of Odd Fellows, had not be
come so firmly rooted in mankind in
general as to eliminate the greed, jeal
ousy and selfishness that is responsi
ble for the distress in the world. The
speaker stated that good work was
being done, however, and that as it
was still in its infancy, results of the
future could be looked forward to with
eager anticipation.
The growth of the order was briefly
traced from its membership of five, at
the time of its inception, to today when
2,300,000 members are banded together
in the great work of benevolence and
charity. During its existence of 97
years the order has disbursed a grand
total of $160,000,000 for the relief of
distress 5,000,000 people have been
aided, and 58 homes for the aged,
widows and orphans have been erected
and maintained,
What Oddfellowship means to the
individual was then touched upon by
the speaker, and he stated that the
lessons taught in the lodge room
tended to elevate that the worth
while things in life were impressed
upon the members, and that good must
of necessity result therefrom. He
called attention to certain cases he
knew of where members attended week
after week and year after year, from
the age of 21 to the late evening of
life, always deriving a wholesome
inspiration from the high ideals con
stantly exemplified in the lodge work.
In conclusion Mr. Loevinger stated
that as a builder of character he could
conceive of nothing better than Odd
Fellow membership, if supplemented
by interested attendance.
The speaker was given the closest
attention throughout, and he made a
most favorable impression upon his
hearers. Should he again visit our
village an appreciative audience is as
sured.
The quartet, mentioned heretofore,
again favored those present with a
vocal selection, and the young men
were recalled. Another selection by
the high school orchestra met with
the favor of all, and then John Bishop
was called upon for a few remarks.
Mr. Bishop responded appropriately,
and paid a deserved tribute to the Re
bekahs for the part played by them
in the observance. As a curtain num
ber the High School orchestra very
generously contributed another pleas
ing selection to the program.
The festivities were not concluded,
Minnr Historic*! Soflelly
however, as supper was then an
nounced, and all repaired to I. O. O. F.
hall, where a luncheon consisting of
appetizing sandwiches, coffee of
tempting flavor, tri-colored icecream,
and cake was partaken of.
The floor was then cleared, and
dancing concluded the evening's en
tertainment. Numerous of those pres
ent remained to trip the light fan
tastic, and it was an enjoyable ending
to a pleasant evening.
Easter at St. Edward's.
Commodious St. Edward's church
was none too large on last Sunday
morning to accommodate the congre
gation that asembled there for the
religious observance of Easter. Twice
in the morning that sacred edifice was
filled with devout worshippers. Up
wards of 600 people attended. At the
S :30 mass some 250 received holy com
muntion. The services were very im
pressive and revealed the poyful char
acter of the feast. The appearancs of
the church with sanctuary and al+ar
adorned with Easter lilies and dozens
of flickering lights, the gladsome
notes of Allelujah that resounded again
and again from priest and choir, to
gether with the joyful gospel message
of the risen Lord breathed the spirit
of happiness and joy that fills the
Christian's heart on this day. It was
in marked contrast with the mournful
ceremonies of holy week, that point so
vividly to the suffering of the Re
deemer on Calvary. The choir was at
its best, with Mrs. C. A. Caley direct
ing and Miss Edmere Robarge presid
ing at the organ. The mass they sang
is one that is heard only in Cathedrals
and the larger churches in the cities.
It was rendered most pleasingly. The
sanctuary was filled with vested altar
boys whose prayerful attitude through
out the services elicited universal
praise.
Close attention was ghen Father
Willenbrmk's sermon as he pictured
the triumph of the Saviour and His
church against all the evil machina
tions of His enemies, showing how the
establishment of the Christian relig
ion under such adverse circumstances,
and its continuance was stamped
with the mark of divinity and there
fore .the certain pledge of man's own
resurrection from the dead.
Civic Betterment Club Active.
The Woman's Civic Betterment
club, has, through the help of some
of the citizens,arranged a plan where
by the children of the village may
form a garden club, and thus not only
help in making 'their home town
more attractive but also get returns
to themselves. Mr. T. H. Caley has
kindly offered to contribute seeds,
both vegetable and flower, to every
child of school age. The fair associa
tion will give them a place at the
county fair for exhibiting results of
planting, and the Civic club will give
prizes for the best products. Mrs.
Rines and Mr. T. H. Caley have
charge of the distribution of seeds,
and will announce the place of distrib
ution and other points of interest to
the children later. Supt. Marshall
promises the support of the teachers,
and the ladies feel that every citizen
who has had any success at gardening
will give advice and encouragement to
the children.
Easter Ball a Success.
The twelfth annual Easter ball of
the Princeton fire department at the
Armory Monday evening was an un
qualified success. One of the largest
dance crowds of the season was in at
tendance, and each and every one ap
peared to enjoy every minute of the
time from the 9 o'clock grand march
to the final waltz at 3 a. m. The music
by Cason Bros, colored orchestra was
excellent, and the midnight supper at
the Home restaurant was most appe
tizing.
The receipts have not been totaled
as yet, but as over 150 tickets were dis
posed of, and the lemonade stand and
balcony seats brought in some cash,
it is safe to say that the total is well
over $170.
The fire laddies were out in full uni
form, and left nothing undone to make
the occasion an enjoyable one for all.
That they succeeded goes without say
ing, and their reputation as sponsors
for delightful terpsichorean events is
higher than ever.
Automobile Accident.
Helen Chapman, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. R. S. Chapman, was the victim
of an automobile accident Saturday
evening, that might have been ex
tremely serious. It happened near
the depot at train time, and the girl
was crossing over from the depot to
the former office building of W. H.
Ferrell & Co. Odin Odegard, the liv
eryman, came around the corner in
an automobile just then, and he states
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1916.
that as he was preparing to stop the car
it was moving slow. It appears that
Helen stepped to one side, and the car
was swerved to the other, and vice
versa. Before the zigzagging ended,
Helen was knocked over by a fender,
and the front wheel of the machine
passed over her legs. She was taken
to the Northwestern hospital at once,
but no bones were broken, and she
was soon taken to her home. The
girl was bruised some, but it was
most fortunate that the results were
not more serious.
Rioting in Dublin, Ireland.
A riot of some proportions has raged
in Dublin, Ireland, since Monday, and
several lives have been lost. The
authorities claim that they have the
matter well in hand and that the
trouble is over. Nevertheless, Dub
lin city and county is under martial
law and a strict censorship is being
exercised.
A German ship loaded with arms
and ammunition for the Irish rebels
was sank off the coast of Ireland, and
Sir Roger Casement, a demented Irish
man, who was supposed to head the
rebellion, has been captured and is
now imprisoned in London.
There is a small faction of irre
conciliables in Ireland known as Sinn
Feiners, who are opposed to British
rule, and this faction is stronger in
Dublin than anywhere else in the is
land. It is these Sinn Feiners who
are causing the trouble. The great
majority of Irishmen, Catholics as well
as Protestants, are loyal to England.
John Redmond and other leaders of
the Irish Home Rule movement have
no sympathy with the Sinn Feiners
and do not regard the "outbreak" as
serious.
If there is a rebellion in Ireland it
will be of short duration, for the rebels
are only an insignificant minority of
the people of Ireland.
A Royal Time.
The ladies of the Royal Crochet club
had a royal time Tuesday evening in
whfch their husbands participated.
First a Leap Year banquet was held
at the Home restaurant, and although
the ladies ostensibly paid the bills
there are those who believe that
"father's" pocketbook is not as cor
pulent as it was. After the tempt
ing supper had been partaken of the
"movies" were visited, with Mrs. A.
E. Hayes as hostess, and then all were
invited to the residence of Mr. and
Mrs. H. L. Cowles, where Five Hun
dred was played until midnight. All in
all more than the usual amount of en
joyment was crowded into one even
ing, and the participants in the festiv
ities pronounced it the best ever.
Makes Improvements.
Rev. Dr. Peterson, pastor of the lo
cal Swedish Lutheran church, is an un
tiring worker for the upbuilding of the
same, and he has succeeded in raising
oer $200 with which to defray the
cost of sbme much needed improve
ments, which are now under way.
Mirick Bros, are doing the work. The
interior will be repainted and re
papered, and a fresh coat of paint will
also be applied to the exterior. Grey
was selected as the color for the out
side, with white trimmings. New frost
ed windows will also be put in, and
when the work is completed, the house
of worship should indeed present a
pleasing appearance. The pastor and
congregation have our congratulations.
Card Party.
The Civic Betterment club will give
a card party at the Armory tomorrow,
Friday, afternoon and evening, and all
are invited. The admission fee has
been fixed at 25c. The afternon ses
sion starts at 2 o'clock and will con
tinue until 5. During this session Mes
dames T. H. Caley, J. A. Smith and
J. F. Petterson will be hostesses. At
the evening session, -which will con
tinue from 8 to 11 o'clock, Mesdames
J. C. Herdliska, Harry Shockley and
A. E. Hayes will be hostesses. The
affair promises to be an enjoyable one,
and the ladies are entitled to a goodly
attendance.
Congregational Easter Observance.
The Easter services at the Congre
gational church last Sunday morning
and-evening were largely attended,
and especially is this true of the morn
ing exercises, when the edifice was lit
erally filled to overflowing. The dec
orations were not extensive, but beau
tiful roses, lilies and ferns were in
evidence, and the interior presented a
most pleasing appearance. The ser
mons by Rev. S. Johnson were partic
ularly appropriate, and the special
music arranged -for the occasion by
Mrs. H. C. Cooney was highly appre
ciated by those in attendance.
THE OPENING GUN
Will Be Fired by Frank B. Kellogg at
His Old Home in Rochester
.This Evening.
Immense Crowds Coming From All
Over Southern Minnesota to
Hear HimHis Speech.
(Special Telegram to The Union)
Rochester, Minn., April 27, 12 m.
The city is fast filling up with people
from Olmsted and the adjoining coun
ties to extend a welcome to Frank B.
Kellogg, and to hear him deliver the
opening speech in his campaign for
United States Senator this evening.
From present indications there will be
10,000 strangers within our gates by
6 p. jn. The armory, opera house and
other large halls have been secured,
but |there are not halls enough in
Rochester to care for half the people
who are anxious to hear Mr. Kellogg.
There will be at least three meetings
in progress at the same time. Mr.
Kellogg will deliver his main talk at
the armory and will then speak briefly
at two other meetings. Among the
other speakers will be Hon. F. C.
Stevens, Hon. J. Adam Bede, 'ex-Gov-
ernor Van Sant, and Senator Frank E.
Putnam.
Our city is fairly ablaze with en
thusiasm for Mr. Kellogg. He has
been serenaded three times already
this morning by out of town bands and
returned his thanks briefly from the
balcony of the hotel.
Among Mr. Kellogg's most enthus
iastic admirers are hundreds of life
long democrats, and it is freely pre
dicted that he will fairly sweep this
section of the state. Everybody here
is proud of the farmer boy who has
so successfully hoed his own row
through life. Blakely.
This evening at his boyhood home in
Rochester, Frank B. Kellogg will open
his campaign for United States sena
tor. Having secured an advance copy
of the speech he will deliver on the
occasion we take pleasure in giving
our readers the main features of the
same in this issue. The especial at
tention of our farmer readers is called
to his plea for a merchant marine.
There are those who imagine that that
is a question that does not affect to
any great extent the farmers of the
Mississippi Valley. An increase of
from 400 to 1,000 per cent in ocean
freight rates vitally affects every
grower of grain and every raiser of
beef and pork in the United States.
An increase of 36 cents per bushel in
wheat freight rates across the Atlantic
means something to the farmers of
the Northwest. Lack of space pre
vents us from giving the speech in
full. It is a masterful address, and
rings true. There is nothing bom
bastic or demagogical about it. It
sounds just like Frank Kellogg. Read
itit will repay a careful persual.
MR. KELLOGG'S VIEWS.
A little over fifty years ago I came
to Minnesota and with my parents
moved on a farm in Olmsted county.
My boyhood was spent on the farm,
the same life led by thousands of oth
ers in the great and growing west. It
was in your midst that I commenced
the study and practice of the profes
sion which has" been my life work it
was your encouragement and generous
confidence to which is due largely
whatever of success I have attained.
It is but natural that in your midst,
surrounded by my friends, I should
make the first speech of this cam
paign.
When in response to the request of
the editors of the state I announced
my willingness to become a candidate
for the United States senate, I stated
I would declare my position upon the
political issues pending before the Am
erican people. There are many of
these question? today of surpassing
importance, and I must for this speech
select a few in which I believe the
American people are most interested.
This is the platform upon which I
stand:
Imemdiately prepare this coun
try for defense
Protect American citizens up
on the high seas and in foreign
countries
Protect American property
and American foreign commerce
which amounts to over $5,300,-
000,000 per annum
Encourage the construction of
a merchant marine, in order to
handle our foreign commerce and
reduce ocean freight rates, which
are now exhorbitant and an un
reasonable tax on our industries
In foreign relations, demand
and enforce with firmness our
rights against other nations, and
maintain a bold and just neutral
ity
Protect, by reasonable tariff
provisions, the products of our
farms, labor
anrd
other industries
control of the
and the development of our na
tional resources
ou
ai
a
Philippines until we shall have
fulfilled our pledges, and the Is
lands are suited for self-govern
ment
Protect and encourage agricul
ture, the great basis of American
wealth
Maintain the integrity of rep
resentative government and the
purity and stability of the
courts
Strive for a higher standard
of social justice and maintain
the independence and security
of labor
Introduce economy, thrift and
efficiency in the departments of
government
Enforce the anti-trust laws,
so as to keep open the avenues
of enterprise for the American
people.
As we are today facing the shadows
of this great European conflict, the
first and paramount duty of the Am
erican people is to make immediate
and thorough preparation to defend
the country, maintain our rights and
preserve our institutions. No other
issue is of such surpassing impor
tance. There is only one way to do it,
and that is to immediately take steps
to procure an efficient and adequate
army and ttfa.,y *cJ* to husband our
resources and finances so
4that our pu
sition will be respected by foreign
countries, and thus insure protection
to our people. This does not mean
war it is the only way to peace. A
weak and unprotected country invites
attack.
In the impending grave crisis there
is only one thing for this people to do,
and that is to stand squarely for the
maintenance of* the national honor,
for the protection of American citizens
upon the high seas and in foreign
lands, and for the protection of Amer
ican property and commerce. We can
not consent that the rules of interna
tional law for the protection of inno
cent people, established by the dictates
of humanity and by the consent of all
civilized nations, shall be swept away
in this maelstrom of war. These are
duties which we owe ourselves and
to the world, if American citizenship
is to be respected. There is no sacri
fice a people may be called upon to
make which should not be willingly
made to accomplish this object for a
government which does not afford that
protection and has not the confidence
and respect of its own people and of
the civilized world cannot permanent
ly endure.
The one man who is, and has been,
doing more than anyone else to stir the
patriotism of the people and to awaken
them to a realization of the dangers
of the country, is that great leader of
men, Theodore Roosevelt.
We know our country is facing grave
perils, and all history tells us, in
language that cannot be misunder
stood, that we cannot rely simply on
our good intentions and high purpose
to protect us against the aggressions
of other nations, inspired by the love
of conquest, trade wars, their own
economic necessities, racial animosi
ties, greed or ambition. The present
war demonstrates this fact. We have
learned from it that as much as we
may wish it to be otherwise, the age
of war has not passed the millennium
has not come
We should, so far as is consistent
with national dignity and honor, do
everything to avoid war. We should
practice and set the example to the
people of the world of the principles
of right and justice, which go far to
prevent these conflicts but we may
not be able to control those mighty
currents of public sentiment,often
invisible,which at times have swept
nations into war and changed the des
tinies of peoples.
Our conduct during this war has not
tended to make us respected abroad.
We have not stood firm, as we should,
for the protection of American citizens
upon the high seas and the protection
of our commerce with both neutral and
belligerent nations. Foreign countries
believe us to be weak, unprepared and
afraid of war. We know we are un
prepared, but that as a people we
have a high sense of honor and pa
triotism and an unconquerable spirit
to maintain American rights.
I shall not
attempt to discuss the details of mili
tary or naval preparedness that re
quires the opinion of experts in the
war department and navy department
men who have given their lives to
this work, and such as every other
nation depends upon. When, how
ever, the opinion of trained experts
has been given, it should not be over
ruled and supressed by some politi
cian who happens for a brief period
of time to be the superior officer of
such experts. And the trained experts
who have been educated at Annapolis
and West Point and who have devoted
their lives to a study of these ques
tions should not. be gagged and pre
vented from giving in full to the con
gress the result of their studies.
This is a matter that interests every
part of the country. Business connec
tions and commerce carried on be
tween the coasts and the interior of
the country are so much a part of the
daily life of the citizens from ocean
to ocean, that the people of the Miss
issippi Valley are as keenly interested
in this subject as are the people upon
the coasts. Furthermore, we are one
nation and one people, and it is ap
palling to think of the consequence
which might follow our utter unpre
paredness to defend our country.
I know it is said that the increase
of navies and standing armies of Eu
ropean countries did not preserve
peace,cnat the building up of these
arn'ies and ravies, upon the breaking
out of the war, but added to the tre
mendous destruction and intensity of
the conflict. This is the pacificists' ar
gument against making any prepara
tion in this country. But we are re
moved from immediate contact of Eu
ropean countries. There is not the
same necessity for large standing
armies, nor the same incentive as there
was in Europe. We do not need an
army and navy adequate for con
quest, &T+ onlv for dn* W are
to some extent removed from those
warring nations but nevertheless it
is idle for us to think that the sea or
distance is a complete protection, for
modern giant ships and navies have,
to a large extent, annihilated distance.
Will we as a people be guided by the
advice of Washington, Monroe, Ham
ilton, Jefferson, Lincoln and all the
great statesmen from the beginning
of our government? Let us bear in
mind the words of the Father of our
Country when he said:
"There is a rank due to the
United States among nations. If
we desire to avoid insult, we
must be able to repel it if we
desire to secure peace one of the
most powerful instruments of
our prosperity, it must be known
that we are at all times ready
for war."
I am speaking to men and women
in whose veins runs the blood of he
roic races of the world races which
have demonstrated upon many battle
fields their right to liberty races
which in those struggles and conflicts
established permanent and enduring
democracy. I do not need to appeal
to these men and women to make se
cure that liberty and their govern
ment.
One of the most vital subjects now
before the American congress and the
people of this country is that of for
eign commerce and merchant marine.
In 1915 our commerce with foreign
countries amounted to $5,326,077,067,
of which more than $3,547,480,372 con
sisted of our products sold in other
countries and more than a thousand
million dollars was farm products.
With the exception of the coastwise
commerce, at the beginning of the war
we hadr,xery-little-merchant
but were dependent upon the ships
of other nations. To-day, we practi
cally ha^e no ships on the Pacific
ocean.
I wish to impress upon the farmers
and business men of Minnesota their
vital interest in this question. How
much greater returns would we have
received for our wheat,Hour and other
farm products had it not been for the
enormous ocean freight rates incident
to the scarcity of ships and our want
of a merchant marine? Let me give
you some illustrations: The increase
in ocean rates on grain from New
York to Liverpool in the last two
years has been about 900 per cent on
flour about 500 per cent, and on all
provisions about 400 per cent. The
rate on wheat in. January 1914, from
