Senator Fred N. Zihlman.
Below subjoined is a list of a few of the leading Republicans
of Washington County who are supporting Senator Zihlman for
!he Republican roniinafion for Comrress,
it was Senator Zihlman. who in 1614 with a divided party
at his hack, all hut defeated David .). Lewis.
Why then now turn him down in 1616 when the party is
united V
Would that constitute fair play?
The truth is not a single sound argument can be made
against the logic of Senator Zihlaian’s candidacy.
We therefore unreservedly tender him our support:—

To the Democratic
Voters of Frederick County.
Hon. Blair Lee has consistently upheld President Wilson in his
measures for Preparedness. The same cannot be said in favor of Mr.
David Lewis, his opponent, as the Congressional Record will show.
Congressman Lewis, less than a year ago, made the statement that
Senator Lee should remain in the Senate. In these trying times, it is
doubly important to have Maryland represented by a Senator who is in
full accord and sympathy with President Wilson in his policy and meas
ures, which stand for safety, protection and for the honor of the United
States. If Senator Lee was needed in the Senate a year ago to uphold
the hands of President Wilson, he is much more needed now, as he is do
ing splendid work in support of the President.
Will you not help to keep him there by your vote in the coming
Primary Election, May 1, 1916.

Alex. P. Beatty Buried.
Thursday afternoon, April 20th, the
remains of Mr. Alex. P. Beatty, of Wash
ington, D. C., was interred in the United
j Brethren cemetery at this place, short
' funeral services being held at the home
! of Mr. and Mrs. M.. L Rouzer, Rev. W.
C. Waltemyer, of the Lutheran church,
: officiating.
j Speaking of our deceased friend, Mr.
i Charles H. Heeds, of Carlisle, Pa., writ-
I ing for the Carlisle Evening Sentinel,
| say*:
j “Our letter this week is one of the
; saddest that we have penned during our
! many journalistic years, rendered so by
I our personal association of more than
I six decades, including boyhood, manhoul,
' and advancing years, as well as practical
i representatives of the same trad
I printing.
“Alex. P. Beatty, youngest son of that
; foremost citizen, the late Captain E.
Beatty, of Company A, Seventh Penn
sylvania Reserves, was born in 1848.
“After attending the Public Schools
and the Grammar connected with Dick
inson College, he entered the office of
the Carlisle American, Geo. Zinn, editor |
and proprietor, as an apprentice to the ]
printer trade, which ha finally finished
in the office of the Carlisle Herald
“During his early days as a journey
man printer, he traveled extensively, and
worked on daily morning papers in many
large cities and towns.
“At different periods he was editor
and proprietor of offices in Carlisle, Me
chanicstown, (now Thurman) Mil., and
Georgetown, now know l as Washington,
D. C.
“It was during the 70’s that the de
ceased received his first appointment to
the Government Printing ofli ;e at Wash
ington. After succeeding to the owner
ship of the Maryland Journal, he wedded
Miss Sarah Rouzer, the daughter of one
of the prosperous and influential citizens
of the mountain town.
“After a few years, he was favored
with a second appointment to the world’s
greatest printing office.
“He was a worthy member of Pioneer
Council of Jonadabs, of Washington, one
of the most powerful temperance organ
izations in the world.
“During the past twenty years Aleck
Beatty was regarded as one of the lead
ing factors in the Mission work at the
Capitol of the Nation, especially of that
branch of the Central Union Mission, lo
cated in the northwest section in prox
imity to the river front. A veteran work
er informs us that he not only sacrificed
his time outside of Government employ,
but his finances in his efforts t > redeem
his fellowman.
“Funeral services were held at his
home on Thursday evening, April 20, at
6 30, largely attended by representatives
of the organizations with which he was
closely identified as well as his fel.i w
craftsmen. Rev. W. A. Marshall, pas
tor of the Presbyterian church, of which
he had been a devoted member for eight
years, conducted the service.”
’Rah For Mayor Marlin.
One day last week our new Mayor. Mr.
Joseph C. Martin, went a fishing up
Hunting creek and came home happy and
with a smile that lasted several deys.
He caught two fine trout, one weighing
’if pounds, 15 inches long, and another
not quite so heavy. This was not the

ties, nor was it the first he has I rough!

Fortunes In Farthings.
It Is well known that shopkeepers
make pounds by ignoring farthings, oi
by giving something for them that
is worth far less than a farthing; but
where shopkeepers make the pounds,
banks and tho English government
make their hundreds of pounds, ac
cording to a writer in Pearson’s. If a
farthing is due from you in taxes, you
are charged Id. On the other hand,
you are never paid Id for a farthing.
The same principle Is applied to
fractions of pounds. Banks In reck
oning interest for themselves call any
part of £1 a full pound, whereas in
reckoning Interest for you odd shil
lings are left out of account. Thus
for a deposit of £99 9s lid you would
receive interest on £99 only.
It is amazing how the state profits
by not paying fractions of pence.
The government has a special fund
In which are placed the fractions ot
pence withheld in paying dividends on i
government stock. This fund amount [
ed to more than £150,000 in ten years
before being used for other purposes
As far as the government is con
cerned, farthings mean a lot.
WHY RAIN INDUCES SLEEP
> Moisture, It Is Asserted, Causes th 6
Blood to Circulate Far Slower
I Than It Should.
Sleep is the result of poisoning. A
day spent in active work, whether of
the mind or the muscles, entails exer
tion. Exertion means the breaking
I down of cells in various parts of the
body, and the waste from these brok
en-down cells forms a sort of poison
which It is the duty of the blood to
carry away. When awake, we make
more poison than the blood can re
move; when asleep, we make less;
consequently by alternately waking
and sleeping, the balance is evened
up.
When we wake up fresh, all these
toxic or poisonous products have been
removed; when we wake up “stale" it
1s because we have not been able to
got rid of them. Working too hard or
too long, or sleeping too little or too
lightly, means that the poison is in
creasing in quantity and our health
suffers. The desire to sleep late
is the body’s signal that we need more
sleep in order to get rid of this body
! waste.
In crisp, cold weather, in a bedroom
I with the windows open, the blood cir
culates rapidly. We breathe more
easily, the air enters the lungs more
rapidly, the purifying oxygen enters
the blood more freely and eight hours
of sleep will purge the system of all
the previous day's harm.
In rainy weather, or in a room with
the windows closed, the blood circu
lates slowly and sluggishly. Breath
ing moist air is harder than breath-
I ing dry air, so that the body has to do
j more work. This takes away some of
its capaelty for removing the work
poison. In addition to this, when the
air is damp the oxygen is held fast
by the air and it does not go through
the membrane of the blood vessels
in the lungs so easily. The blood,
therefore, receives leas of the purify
ing oxygen and is not as well able to
rid the body of the poison.
In order to make up for the differ
ence between dry and damp air a
greater number of hours of sleep are
needed. If, for example, on a rainy
night or in a closed room, the amount
of oxygen received is only one-half of
what it ought to be, it will be neces
sary to sleep twelve hours in order
[ to secure as much good as eight hours
in crisp and dry air.
Sleeping late on rainy mornings
shows that nature is not satisfied with
the amount of recovery from work of
the day before. This is the cause of
a “bad taste in the mouth," of much
yawning, of aches in the joints and ol
a bad temper at breakfast time. For
| exactly the same reasons people in
i mountainous countries sleep much
less on the average than those in the
lowlands. —Pittsburgh Post.
Y. M. C. A. In Egypt.
Wherever a camp has been creat
ed the V. M. C. A. has pitched Its ten!
—at first an ordinary canvas one, but
later on one made of matting, says
the London Mail. Each tent is rup
by a voluntary secretary—usually a
university man—who merely looks to
the association for his board and lodg
ing, and who is responsible for the
organization of his particular area
At each of these centers the men find
materials for letterwriting, papers tc
read, games to play; they can get
good square meals at ridiculously low
prices, and they can use the tent ab
solutely as their recreation’room. Ev
ery evening there is something doing
—concerts, organized by the secretary
or by private individuals, in which
the men take part; popular lectures,
competitions, boxing matches, etc.
En passant, it is interesting to note
that since the association started op
erations among the troops in Egypt
alone it has distributed 3,GU0,000 sheets
of paper and as many envelopes, and
that at the present moment it requires
400,000 sets every month. One won
ders how many of these letters would
have been written had it not been for
the intervention of the association.
Corrected His Age.
A well-known textile union official
who is on a recruiting committee tells
a story of a man aged forty-four
years, who was anxious to join the
army.
At the recruiting office he put his
foot in it by telling his true age, and
was rejected.
Going to the union man he com
plained bitterly of the red tape ideas
that kept him out of the army.
“Well,” said his adviser, "go back
and say you made a mistake, and that
your real age is thirty-six."
Away went the would-be soldier, and
putting on a bold front, told the re
cruiter that he was only thirty-six
years of age,
“And why on earth did you say you
were forty-four?” asked the sergeant.
"Oh —you see—” stammered the
man, "I got a bit mixed. It’s my moth
er who is forty-four!”—Loudon An
swers.
Nothing More Lacking.
“Young man,” said the elderly mil
lionaire, "my daughter has had every
luxury.”
“Every luxury but one, perhaps, and
that one I am in a position to supply,
sir.”
“What do you mean?”
“A husband.”
One of Life’s Necessities.
. “Dubwalte figures his expense ac
count rather closely.”
"He didn’t u6e to be that way.”
“Oh. he has a car now. A man has
to be careful to keep a balance in the
bank large enough to cover his gaso
line bills.” _

I The Master’s Re
! ception Evening
By REV. HOWARD W. POPE
of the Moody Bible Institute
of Chicago
—— -V ~.x
TEXT—Not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together.—Heb. 10:25.
I. The ideal prayer meeting never
happens. If it is a good meeting, some-
body has put
, . f prayer and
thought and work
, Into it. The laws
' °* Brace ai e as
> ( .JxjPH rigid, and as re
| liable, too, as the
ifiwl Ipibflpp laws of nature,
i "Heaven may bo
\ ha< * for the ask
‘ ing,” says the poet,
\ hut the ideal
V P ra y er meeting
\ cannot. It Is as
true here as else
/JIPPI" where that “what
soever a man sow-
Jfyi | M idflTn cth, that shall he
also reap.”
Hence tho leader should prepare
carefully. The hymns can be select
ed; one person can bo asked to pray
for the sick, another for the absent,
and so on. Attention to details helps
immensely. Hut especially should the
leader wait upon God in prayer until
his heart bums with love, and his soul
is sensitive to the faintest whisper
of the Holy Spirit. If athletes train
for a boat race or a ball game, simply
to secure the applause of people, sure
ly the Christian can afford to train for
a spiritual conflict where all the forces
of heaven and hell are arrayed against
each other, where eternal destinies are
at stake, and where every part of the
service is watched with keenest so
licitude by "so great a cloud of wit
nesses.”
Not only the leader, but all the mem
bers should prepare. Let them read,
think and pray over the subject. Let
them deny themselves dally, for a
godly life is tho best preparation for
an ideal meeting. Let them gather up
spiritual strength all the week and
concentrate it upon this service, mak
ing it the supreme hour of the week,
the hour
When heaven comes down our souls to
greet,
Ami glory crowns the mercy-seat.
11. The Ideal prayer meeting has an
object as well as a subject—a definite
object, never to be forgotten by the
leader or the workers.
What is that subject? It Is not
simply to have an interesting meeting.
A service may be interesting, and yet
be so devoid of spirituality as to sug
gest only, “sounding brass and tinkling
cymbals.” The real object is to
awaken spiritual emotion, to bring the
soul face to face with God, to kindle
fires of devotion until tho altar is all
ablaze with tho sacrifice of willing
hearts, and there comes over the audi
ence that Indescribable thrill and holy
hush which betokens the presence of
God, and which makes every heart
ready to say, “O God, thy will be
done.”
This is the true object of a prayer
meeting—to bring every soul to the
point where it is willing to do its duty,
so that decisions may be made and re
sults may be secured, right then and
there. At the close of a meeting
where the theme was temperance the
tide of feeling rose so high that 64
young men and women signed a total
abstinence pledge and thereby com
pletely revolutionized the temperance
sentiment of that church.
Whatever the subject of the meet
ing, never lose sight of the object.
Feeling which does not lead to action
it of questionable value.
111. The ideal meeting is cheerful,
social and hearty. Have a bright car
pet on the floor, appropriate pictures
on the wall, flowers on the table, and
the room seated with chairs. Make it
look as lirtle like a church, and as
much like a home as possible. Lay
off hats, wraps and overshoes.
Have a “smile-’em-up committee” at
the door to welcome strangers and to
distribute the audience widely—the
small boys apart from each other, the
