wireless to Columbus, N. M.—Two
Americans were killed and three
wounded In an engagement between
cavalrymen under Col. George A.
Dodd and 260 Villa bandits at Tom
achio, in the center of the Sierra
Msdres in western Chihuahua, April
22, according to an official report
reaching here today. The Villa com
mand under four chiefs, Baca, Cer
vantes, Dominguez and Oios, was sur
prised in the late afternoon and routed.
After the battle the Americans found
six dead Mexicans and nineteen
wounded, while a quantity of horses,
arms and equipment was captured.
Reports received here made no men
tion of Villa himself being with the
band.
The Villa bandits were encamped
In a rocky defile when they caught
sight of the American column. Imme
diately the Mexican bugles sounded
the call to arms. Through the moun
tain pass the two commands engaged,
the Villa bandits dropping all cum
bersome equipment in flight before
Col. Dodd's cavalrymen.
Once during the flight the Vflla
forces received reinforcements and
attempted vainly to make a stand
against the Americans. When night
cane the pursuit ended because of
the jagged nature of the'ground.
Col. Dodd pursued the bandits to
ward Minaca. his base where he is
now reported to be awaiting supplies.
The nineteen Villa wounded taken
in the engagement and the twenty-five
horses and arms captured were taken
to Minaca. Col. Dodd was officially
commended for the promptness
shown by his small, outnumbered
force.
Other reports reaching here told of
bitter feeling expressed toward
Americans by natives of the district.
It is assumed that the reinforcement
the Mexican consul received was
made up of natives from the vicinity.
CAVALRY IN ACTION.
B1 Paso, Tex., April 26.—A report has
been received here that Col. Dodd's
advanced cavalry detachment had an
engagement several days ago in which

tle came in a private dispatch but gave
&o information where the engagement
took place. Advanced detachments of
Col. Dodd's cavalry have been operat
ing in a limited zone just north of
Batevo. Officials of the de facto gov
ernment were optimistic today "in the
belief that the mission of Geh. Alvaro
Obregon, minister of war, to this city
or Juarez to confer with MaJ. Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the U.
S. army, will result in a satisfactory
plan whereby peaceful conditions may
be maintained along the border.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul here,
said that nothing but good can come of
the conference.
Pending the conference, which prob
ably will be held late this week, the
bases and lines of communication of
the American army in Mexico are be

DOES NO DAMAGE
GERMAN CRAFT HOVER OVER
BRITISH COAST AND ARE
SHOT AT IN VAIN.
London, April 26.—The Zeppelins
which made a raid over the east coast
last night remained at a great height
probably because they1 were subjected
to violent fire from anti-aircraft guna.
The raiders were favored by the dark
night and light wind but were forced
to flee after a short time.
A correspondent from Essex county
say a Zeppelin was picked up by a
searchlight at the outskirts' of the
county and in a few minutes was out
lined by other searchlights. Shrapnel
began to burst around it from many
directions. The Zeppelins climbed
very high and hovered about for ten
minutes. Then it sailed eastward. No
bombs were dropped after the search
lights found it.
The number of casualties and extent
of the damages caysed by the raid
have not yet been ascertained.
DUEL IN THE AIR.
Paris, April 26.—A French aero
plane and a Zeppelin fought a duel at
an altitude of 4,000 meters off Zee

fight with the British light cruiser
squadron and destroyers, so far as can
be learned. All the British ships have
returned safely, two of the light cruis
ers bearing signs that they had been
hit by shells but not in vital places. A
few among the crews of the British
warships were wounded but not seri
ously.

BERNSTORFF IS
SEEKING PEACE
Ambassador Sends Germany
His Suggestions for
Averting a Break
FOREIGN OFFICE
SEEKS SOLUTION
Report Is That Kaiser Will
Go to Any Length to
Prevent Rupture
Berlin, April 26. —The German
answer to the American note may
not be expected before the end of
the present week. It may be pre
sented on Saturday.
Washington, D. C., April 26.—Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor, in response to a request from the
Berlin foreign office has cabled sugges
tions for a course in the submarine
crisis which he believes will avert a
break with the United States. The
request from the foreign office for the
ambassador's suggestions contained
the statement that Germany was pre
pared to go to great lengths to prevent
a rupture.
It is considered probable that Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg, the imperial
chancellor, took with him when he left
Berlin last night to visit the emperor
at army headquarters dispatches con
taining the recommendations of the
ambassador. As the round trip be
tween Berlin and the headquarters re
quires forty hours and the chancellor
must have time to confer with the
emperor and other officials there, it is
considered unlikely that definite word
of the intentions of the government
can reach the United States before
the end of the week.
GERMANS 8ERIOUS.
Geneva, Switzerland, April 25.—Ger
man newspapers are now taking a
more serious view of the Germau
American situation. They say Em
peror William is expected to return to
Berlin from general headquarters. In
the meantime Americans attempting to
leave Germany by way of Switzerland
are encountering difficulties. Many
of them are held up at Constance, the
Baden frontier having been closed
since yesterday.
FRONTIERS CLOSED.
Paris, April 26.—The German-Swiss
frontier has been closed since Monday
afternoon, even to mails, says a dis
patch to the Matin from Berne. For
eigners now in Germany have been in
formed that none will be allowed to
leave the country before twenty days
have elapsed, the dispatch adds.
SHIP RE8ISTS CAPTURE.
Berlin, April 26.—The circumstances
which attended the sinking of the
British steamship Goldmouth, March
81, were related today by the Overseas
News agency as follows:
"It is stated authoritatively that the
crew was first signalled to leave the
ship. As no attention was paid to the
warning signal, a shot was fired.
Thereupon the steamship immediatelj
opened fire on the German submarine.
"An engagement of half an hour fol
lowed. The steamship was hit eight
times. The crew then left the Gold
mouth. One of them was wounded
severely.
"The captain of the Goldmouth was
made prisoner because he had attacked
a German warcraft. The guns of the
Goldmouth were served by two gun
ners of the British navy."

COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE
IS FORESHADOWED IN AS
QUITH'8 STATEMENT.
London, April 26.—Premier Asqulth,
at the secret session of parliament
yesterday, presented on behalf of'the
government proposals foreshadowing
general military compulsion unless
success attended "immediate efforts
to obtain men required by voluntary
enlistment from amongst unattested
married men." The government's pro
posals were publicly announced today.
The government, Mr. Asquith said,
will "forthwith ask parliament for
compulsory power," unless at the end
of four weeks ending May 27, fifty
thousand men have been secured by
voluntary enlistment. The same course
1b proposed if in any one week after
May 27, 15,000 men have not been se
cured by direct enlistment.
These arrangements are to hold un
til 200,000 unattested men have been
obtained.
Owing to the length of time requir
ed to sift individual cases under the
present system, the press statement
said, recruiting to date has "fallen
short of requirements which were
necessary to fulfill our proper military
effort."
VON IGEL PAPERS
NOT ALL OFFICIAL
GERMAN AMBA8SADOR DOES NOT
WI8H TO AID IN IDENTIFYING
DOCUMENT8.
Washington, D. C., April 26.—John
B. Stanchfield of New York, acting as
counsel for the German embassy, will
confer with Secretary Lansing or
Counselor Polk of the Btate depart
ment here about the papers seized by
agents of the department of justice
from the New York office of Wolfe
von Igel, secretary to Capt. Franz
von Papen, the withdrawn German
military attache.
Von Igel will accompany Mr. Stanch
field and. if the state department of
ficials wish, will Identify any papers.
The German embassy, it was said to
day, takes the position that the papers
do not concern Count von Bernstorff,
the ambassador, but pertain particu
larly to the office of the military at
tache. For that reason it is contend
ed the ambassador is not called upon
to identify any of them.
The papers are said to contain a list
of names of persons in this country
connected with alleged unneutral ac
tivities. It has been pointed out that
identification of any of the papers as
official by the ambassadbr himself
would connect the embassy with the
affairs disclosed in them.
The Von Igel papers, it is under
stood, also contain material disclos
ing activities in this country related
to the recent uprising in Ireland a«d
the names of Americans who had
knowledge of the plans.

RUSHED TO WASHINGTON TO
HANDLE THEM.
Washington, D. C., April 26. —The

GOAL BY NIGHTFALL
Big Campaign Committee Is
Successful on Canvass
to Extent of $1,477
At lunch time the various •olio
I tors met at the association
rooms and after eating a hearty
meal made reports on the prog
ress of the campaign. Chairman
Chase Bannister announced that
the subscriptions for the morning
totaled $1,477 dollar* and that the
prospects were excellent for
reaching the $3,500 mark by
nightfall. The pledges ranged
from fifty cents to one hundred
dollars, there being three of the
latter denomination.
State Secretary W. M. Parsons
of Des Moines spoke briefly on
"pep" and faith In getting sub
scriptions. Various of the work
ers then related their experiences
of the morning and It was found
that in nearly every case they had
met with ready success.
After a reassignment of cards,
the solicitors resumed their work.
That there has just passed, for the
local Young Men's Christian asBOcl*

affair, and, in a measure, the meeting
and banquet Tuesday evening was a
'preparedness" step for it.
Nearly 200 men sat down to the
three long tables, which had been
placed in the gymnasium. At 6:45
they entered the room while one of the
"Y" orchestras played. The three

green streamers and the tables carried
strings of smllax.
President John Mahon opened the
remarks with a short sketch' of the
year's work, emphasizing the fact that
strict economy and close watching on
the part of all had resulted in the as
sociation coming out at the end of the
year with a surplus.

NOT TO INSTRUCT.
Little Rock, Ark., April 26.—Predic
tions by republican leaders that the
national convention delegates to be

testing "lily white" instead of colored
delegations from Pulaski and Hemp
stead counties, and election of a
national committeeman. The latter
contest lay between H. M. Remmel of
Little Rock, present committeeman,
and Harry H. Meyers, Hot Springs.
Mr. Meyers represented colored del
egates in contests heard last night by
the state central committee which de
cided to seat the white delegations.
