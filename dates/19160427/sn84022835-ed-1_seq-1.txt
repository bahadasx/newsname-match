High School Gives Musicale.
The musicale given by the pupils of
tiie school Friday evening, under the
supervision of Miss Nina Simmons
was a very successful and enjoyable
nllair.
The Orpheum was well tilled by an
appreciative audience. Of course, the
little ones were star periormers, espe
cially tho ten little Indians, the but
tercups, sweet peas and dancing daffo
dils. But the readers and soloists'
were hardly less pleasing to the hear
ers. The choruses showed a decree
of skill aud musical taste hardly to be
expected from the brief training which
could be given to the scholars. Miss
Simmons is evidently determined to
awaken an appreciation for what is
best in music. Wagner, Straus, Gou
nod, Balfe, Lacome were drawn upon.
It is far better to fail studying mast
ers of tills character than to succeed iu
the rendition of what is not worthy
the effort to understand and execute
There was nothing like failure in any
number of the program. But more
practice would improve some ot tho
selections. Tlio eliort to succeed was
abundantly manifest, and it will not
be long before the people of this city
will be able to note the results of the

study of the great artists under com

The receipts of tho evening amount
to $r0, which will be devoted to the
purchase of a phonograph, that tho
pupils may hear the best of recorded
music.

morning from Annapolis, Mil,, whcie
he has been attending preparatory
school, making preparation to take
tlio examination for entrance to tho

The examinations were held last

the examinations pass. Examinations

In Febr. this year, 3M) took the exam

receive a four year training and col
lege course and upon graduation would
