STATE'S ATTORNEY PREPARING
FOR VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN
WITH EXPECTATIONS OF WIN­

!&.••1
iSi*
The announcement of O. B. Herig­
stad for the republican nomination
for state's attorney of Ward county
appears in this issue.
So far, Mr. Hergistad has no oppo­
sition. At present he has the "pole"
in the race and he is going to try
to keep it until the end of the pri­
maries on June 28.
Mr. Herigstad was born in a sod
shanty on a farm in Griggs county, N.
D., and he points to the fact that he
is a pioneer with considerable pride.
He secured his early education in the
country schools of that county and be­
ing possessed of an ambition to do
more than ordinary things, went to
college. Being a poor boy, he did not

let the lack of money interfere with
his securing an education. He got out
and dug good and hard, earning the
money which paid his way thru the
North Dakota state university for six
years. He canvassed during the sum­
mer and threshed for farmers in the
fall. He made a good record in col­
lege, being a member of the Intercol­
legiate debating teams, winning the
debates with South Dakota and Man­
itoba. He took considerable interest
in oratory and won the prize in the
Commencement Oratorical contest.
Two of his reviews, one on Norweg­
ian Immigration and another on A
Study of the Norwegian People in
North Dakota ,appear in volumes of
the State Historical Society.
Mr. Herigstad came to Minot in
1909 to practice law. He was assist­
ant state's attorney under R. A. Nes
tos for a time and when the latter re­
signed recently, he was chosen to fill
that office.
Mr. Herigstad is married and has
one daughter two years of age. He is
prominently identified with the Sons
of Norway organization. Mr. Herig­
stad has proved to be a fearless
state's attorney and he posseses con­
siderable ability.
J. C. YOUNGKIN
IT INSTANT DEATH
WELL KNOWN OLD RESIDENT
STRUCK BY ENGINE OF SOO
TRAIN NO. 105 TUESDAY AND
HURLED TO HIS DEATH.
J. C. Youngkin, aged 76 years, who
has made his home in Minot for the
past twenty years, was instantly kill­
ed at the east end of the city shortly
after one o'clock Tuesday afternoon,
when he was struck by the engine of
the fast Soo passenger train, No. 105,
and hurled thru the air for 35 feet.
The terrible accident was witnessed
by Mrs. Rounds, 1110 Valley Street,
C. J. Hoffman, Mrs. Geo. Hoffman, J.
Snyder and Jack Zeff, who either live
in that vicinity or happened to be near
the scene of the accident.
Mr. Youngkin, who lived just this
side of the Soo stock yards, left home
shortly after dinner, carrying a sack.
He was either going to pick up coal
along the railroad or intended going
to the river to fish, both occupying the
time of the old gentleman to some ex­
tent. He had frequently walked up
the railroad track and Tuesday he was
walking just outside of the south rail.
He may not have heard the train
coming, for he was quite hard of hear­
ing, or if he did, he must have thot
that he was far enough to one side to
escape accident, for he did not pay
any attention to the oncoming train.
The fireman, Bert Warner, saw the
man, but as the engineer had whistled
at the crossing, he expected that he
would step out of the way. When it
was seen that he was in danger, it was
-Ill' I ..

then too late to stop the train. The
body was struck by the wooden beam
that extends out from in front of the
pilot and he received such a blow
that he was thrown fully 35 feet
ahead and to one side.
The body was picked up at the bot­
tom of the grade 20 feet south of the
track. He never knew what had
struck him.
The left leg had been broken, the
left hand cut, and the head was some­
what disfigured. The forehead had
been scratched and cut, there were
scalp wounds and there was one
wound at the base of the skull below
the right ear, sufficient in itself to
cause death.
The city auto truck was rushed to
the scene of the accident almost im­
mediately by Chief Dougherty, Officer
Darby and Fire Chief O'Leary. The
train, which was stopped as quickly
as possible, backed to where the body
lay. In the absence of Coroner Doe,
who lives at Kenmare, Justice John
Lynch was summoned, and he secured
the names of the witnesses to use in
the inquest which he held the follow­
ing day. Chas. Norton was the en­
gineer and H. H. Rice, the conductor.
The train was delayed for an hour on
account of the unfortunate affair.
The body was taken to Rowan's
morgue and prepared for burial, after
certain data had been secured.
Mr. Youngkin was a fine old gen­
tleman and leaves a large number of
friends. For years he was employed
as a carpenter, but of late years had
not been able to take a very active
part in affairs. He leaves a wife and
nine children, all grown. Clayton

Fattening 500 Steers.
James Scofield, who has been feed­
ing nearly 500 head of two-year-old
steers at his farm south of the city,
during the winter, sent them to the
range Monday. They will fatten on
the nutritious grasses during the sum­
mer months and in the fall will be fed
on silage for several weeks, then mar­
keted as three-year-olds. Mr. Sco­
field fed them nearly 900 tons of en­
silage during the winter and when
they are ready for market, they will
be in prime condition.
YAWS GREAT
STATE'S LARGEST GREENHOUSE
PREPARING TO DO RECORD
BREAKING BUSINESS FOR
MOTHER'S DAY.
Valker's Minot Greenhouse is be­
ginning this week one of the largest
advertising campaigns ever conduct­
ed by a Minot business concern. Ad­
vertisements are being sent out to
200 newspapers of North Dakota and
Montana calling attention to the
splendid stock of the state's largest
greenhouse.
Altho the greenhouse will produce
30,000 more cut flowers this year than
last, there is apt to be a shortage of
carnations for Mother's Day and or­
ders should be placed early. The
greenhouse has over 50,000 tomato
plants that will be ready for ship­
ment about May 16. They also grow
thousands of other plants, such as
cabbage, cauliflower, celery and pep­
per plants.
The Independent has watched the
growth of the Valker Greenhouse with
a. great deal of inttrest. Geo. E. Valk­
er certainly is a hustler, knows his
business and treats his thousands of
customers right. If you buy your
stock from the Valker Greenhouse you
are sure to be pleased.

SELECTED FOR THE POSITION.
Fargo, N. D., April 25.—The Farm­
ers' Rural Credit association, formed
nearly a year ago to transact a farm
loan business and to finance co-opera­
tive organizations, has moved from
Minot to Fargo in order to bring the
business into closer relations with the
equity movement, which centers in
this city.
Grant S. Youmans, who has been
treasurer and general manager since
the formation of the association in
June, 1915, has resigned and will de­
vote his entire time to his own busi­
ness. Mr. Youmans' first plan was to
move to Fargo and continue to direct
the affairs of the association but de­
velopments at Minot have been such
that he has decided to remain in that
city.
The board of directors of the asso­
ciation met at Fargo and after dis­
cussing thoroughly Mr. Youmans' re­
quest that he be relieved from the ac­
tive management of the association it
was voted to accept his resignation.
S. E. Hall, of Clitheral, Minn., an ex­
perienced bank man, was chosen as
manager of the association and at
once began his duties as such.

New Home For Sammy, the Bear.
A fine large cage is being built in
Riverside Park for "Sammy" the park
bear. Sammy will be housed over in
the southeast corner of the park in
the enclosure which is being provided
for the three elk. Sammy is a well
behaved fellow and gives his keeper
no trouble. He was sheared the other
day and given a bath which he ap­
peared to enjoy thoroughly.
Several of the squirrels came
through the winter nicely, hut a num­
ber of them have been killed by dogs.
Canines are supposed to be barred
from the park, but they will get in
once in a while. The squirrels have
become so tame that tnejr have no
fear of the dogs and are easily caught.
The park is going to be more beau-'
tiful than ever this year, and each
Sunday thousands of people enjoy
themselves in the picturesque place.

Mrs. Shaw was a most remarkable
woman. She was born in London,
England, where she lived until five
years-ago, coming to America to mar­
ry the man who had asked her to join
him in this land of promise. Almost
immediately upon her arrival here she
was married to Mr. Shaw, the cere­
mony being performed at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Earle Stredwick at Lo­
gan, April 8, 1911. Mrs. Shaw had
spont twelve years nursing in Eng­
land. She was a graduate of Guy's
hospital of London and from the St.
Partholomew hospital, making a spec­
ialty of Opthalmic work. She brot
to America recommendations from the
leading London specialists. Since her
marriage she followed her profession
for some time, being superintendent
of the Anamoose hospital for fifteen
months. Her services as a nurse were
demand at all times and it is be­
lieved that she over-exerted herself in
trying to help others, perhaps bring­
ing on the illness which caused her
death.
rIhe
strurnental in alleviating so much
pain.
Mr. and Mrs. Shaw met in London
eighteen years ago. Mr. Shaw was
employed at the time as correspon­
dence clerk for the Prudential Insur­
ance Co. When the Boer war broke
out he volunteered his services, fight­
ing with Sir Leslie Rundle's colmun,
the Eighth division, in 1901 and 1902,
when he was wounded. After the war,
he came to America but all the while
he kept up his correspondence with the
girl far across the sea. Mrs. Shaw
was not only a loving wife but she
was truly a partner in his business
affairs, lending wise counsel. Mr.
Shaw has ever been ready to give to
the business acumen of his wife much
of the credit for what success he has
made in life. Mrs. Shaw has worked
hard that she might assist in build­
ing the cozy little home at Logan, in­
tending soon to quit nursing that she
might spend more time with her hus­
band and enjoy the fruits of their la­
bor.
Over Mrs. Shaw's desk at the Ana
moose hospital this motto was to be
seen: "The Noblest Purpose in Life is
Service and Uplift to Humanity," and
this seemed to be the guiding princi­
ple of her life. As she lay suffering
at the hospital her main desire was
that she might be able to assist in re­
lieving the sufferings of others.
Mrs. Shaw is survived by her aged
mother, three sisters and two broth­
ers, living in London, besides her hus­
band, all of whom have the sincerest
sympathy of the host of friends.
Non-Stop Maxwell In Arizona.

drove it from San Diego to Phoenix
without the slightest trouble. On his
arrival in Phoenix he sent the follow­

B. J. Anderson, the popular chair­
man of the county commissioners, has
opened his batteries in an interesting
campaign, training his guns on what
he has chosen for his objective point,
the republican nomination for clerk of
the district court. Mr. Anderson is
an enthusiastic political warrior, and
while he may be using the Maxim si­
lencers just at present, before the end
of the campaign the smell of powder
will be sufficient to let all the voters
know that he has been in the conflict.
Mr. Anderson came to Ward coun­
ty in 1900 and filed on a homestead
in McKinley township, which he still
owns and which he continued to farm
until three years ago, when he was
elected a member of the board of
county commissioners. He then
moved to Nedrose township that he
might be more convenient to his work.
