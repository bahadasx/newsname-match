Judge Whitney's Decision
Denying Road Injunction
As a matter of general public
interest, the decision of Judge F.
A. Whitney in the proceedings
brought by P. 0. Rickman, a
gainst L. AV. Whitehurst, et al.,
has special news value; and as it
gives in substance the controlling
questions raised in the pleadings,
both sides are presented. The
decision reads as follows:
"This cause comes on for hear
ing upon motion for. injunction a
gainst the County Commissioners
and the Bond Trustees of the
Punta Gorda Special Road
and
Bridge District to prevent
the
further building of the roads of
that district, except by contract
work, I find that the statute un
der which the road district was
created provided for doing the
work by letting to the lowest bid-
" der. 1 find that, the legislature
' in 1915 passed a special and local
law relating only to this particu
lar district, in effect allowing the
work to be done without letting
under a contract.
"The motion came on, upon
bill, demurrer thereto and ans
wer. I think the pleadings raise
but two controlling questions:
Does the Constitution prohibit
' the legislature from passing such
an act as the 1915 act by reason
of its being local or special to a
i particular locality? It is true
that the Constitution prohibits
legislation regulating jurisdiction
or duties of officers in one commu
nity and not generally applicable
to all. I have concluded that
-whether or net this act is offen
sive to the constitution, is at least
'doubtful and therefore under the
law must uphold the act, because
unless an act is clearly and be
yond reasonable doubt, under
:any 'rational view that may be
taken, in positive conflict' with
some identified provision of the
constitution, it should not be de
clared inoperative. The act does
not enlarge the jurisdiction or
duties of County Commissioners
over a subject over which V
' had no jurisdiction before, but re
lates to a subject matter over
which they had full charge before
the act, that is the building of
roads. It was on this ground
that the Supreme Court has up
held a special act to build a dock
and issue bonds therefor. The
same objection was made there as
here to its constitutionality. They
.say, 'we shall not undertake to
define the demarcation between
regulations affecting the County
Government which are directly
permitted and regulations as to
iho jurisdiction and duties of any
class of officers which are prohib
ited. In the matter now before
us it may well be doubted if the
conferring of a power upon a
county through its county com
missioners to levy a tax to meet
bonds issued for a county purpose
regulates their jurisdiction and
duties.' .This seems to be the on
ly expression of the Supreme
Court upon an illustrated ques
. l l'l . T .1
uon, aim wnue noi directly in
point yet throws much light on
the clause in question.
"I am of the poinion that the
constitutional clause in question
means and in its correct, rational
interpretation, was intended to
prohibit the legislature from en
larging the jurisdiction of county
commissioners over a subject mat
ter (except by general law) over
which they had no duties or jur
isdiction before. It was said in
argument that I could be aided
but little by any previous authori
ties; and if the construction of
this clause be one of first impres
sion, I will try to find the true
reason of it. In doing so I be
liteve that the object of the clause
was to confine the officers of all
classes to the power generally
conferred on them and prohibit
the legislature from enlarging
those powers or their jurisdiction
in one locality over new subjects
of jurisdiction, not conferred on
all alike; but has no reference to
defining the details or incidents
in carrying into effect their gen
eral jurisdiction. This seems to
be the more forceful when Section
20, is construed with Section 24,
of the same article 'The legisla
ture shall establish a uniform
system of county government ex
cept in cases where local or spec
ial laws are provided by the leg
islature.' In commenting on this
clause tho Supreme Court said:
'This section indicates a disposi
tion not to hamper the legislature
as to county affairs, in view of
the widely divergent needs of the
immunities in the state, differ
ng so in soil, climate, population
and otherwise.'
"As to the question of vested
right in acts of 1911, I can see no
doubtful question. One can not
acquire a vested right in a statute
That would prohibit the legisla
ture from providing a new or nec
essary method or means for car
rying it into effectual execution.
"Much was said as to the desir
ability, expediency and necessity
of the act of 1915. It must be re
membered that the Courts do not
make the law, but are bound to
only give them rational construc
tion and application as they are
found to exist. The legislature
must be relied upon for expedien
cy and necessity. The courts are
much better satisfied however,
with their decisions if they can
feel that no injury, individual or
collective, ' has resulted from it.
So in this case, I am of course,
more satisfied that an answer set
ting up what is claimed to be the
merits of the facts, has been filed,
because there is much that I can
well see, knowing of some difficul
ties of other communities that
will result in great benefit and
saving, both to individuals and to
community at large, if completed
under the same economical ad
ministration as is claimed in the
answer it has executed up to iow.
"For the reasons given it fel
lows that the injunction nv.ist be
denied and it is so ordered "

Hay Crops Should Follow Spring
Vegetables
Vegetable lands which will be
idle within tho next few weeks
should not be allowed to grow up
in weeds. C. K. McQuarrie,
state agent for the University of
Honda Extension Division, sug
gests that they &3 planted to hay
crops. Weeds will undoubtedly
grow if some; valuable crop is not
planted. Since it is desirable to
have the land covered, it is ad
vantageous to grow some culti
vated crop.
In South Florida Natal on the
high lands and Rhodes grass on
flatwoods are good hay crops. In
the northern part of the state Ger
man millet, cowpeas, or some of
the short period velvet bean hy
brids would make good crops. It
must be understood that Natal
grass, Rhodes grass and German
millet are soil depleting crops,
and that the cowpeas and velvet
beans are soil builders. Conse
quently the legume should be
planted wherever pdssible.
Paraffin Oils Control Whitefly
The most serious insect enemy
of citrus is whitefly. It not only
injures the tree itself but it is the
direct cause of injury and dam
age from sooty mold and purple
scales. The larvae of the white
fly secrete honey dew which af
fords a medium for sooty mold.
Sooty mold not only discolors the
fruits but it shades the leaves and
reduces the functions. of the leav
es. It also affords protection to
the purple scales.
The spring brood of the white
fly is now on the wing and it is
near the close of the flying season.
Growers should watch closely for
the disappearance of tho adults,
wait ten days and then spray. The
wait is necessary to give the last
egg la il a chance to hatch. The
spray will not kill the -eggs.
J. R. Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Station, recommends one of
the paraffinoils for control of the
insect. Mr. Watson urges grow
ers to take every precaution pos
sible against the pest. The fungi
which ordinarily help the grower
are not abundant this year owing
to the continued drouth, hence it
is urgently necessary to spray for
the coming brood.
This spray will also take care
of the rust mite for a while.
Sulfur Sprays Control Rust
Mites
Citrus growers should be on the
alert for rust mites and red spid
ers. These pests are easily over
looked by tho average grower and
they are hard to distinguish with
the naked eye. Fruits and leaves
should be examined with a strong
hand lens for rust mites if one is
not accustomed to looking for
them with the unaided eye.
Those growers who have white
fly and who intend to spray for it
will not need to spray for the
rust mite. If rust mites are dis
covered, however, J. R. Watson,
entomologist to the University of
Florida Experiment Station, rec
ommends spraying with some
form of sulfur. Probably the
most efficient spray is limesulfur.
Some growers prefer to use lime
and sulfur dry. This is cheaper
than the limesulfur but it is not
so efficient. The proportion should
be one pound of hydrated lime to
two or three of flowers of sulfur.

Do Not Limit Citrus Fertilizer to
Area Under Tree
Do vou know how the citrus
tree feeds! The feeding surface
of the roots is limited to about a
quarter of an inch of the tip. The
tips of the roots are continually
pushing out. Consequently the
mass of fibrous roots which gather
nourishment for tho tree1 are re
moved from the trunk.
A great many growers apply
fertilizers in a circle or ring be
neath the tree. The best results
cannot be had from this method
because a large part of the fertil
izers never reach the feeding root
tips. B. F. Floyd plant physiolo
gist to the University ot r lorida
Experiment Station, suggests that
the fertilizer be spread over the
surface between the trees and un
der the outer branches.
The reasons for this suggestion
are, first, because the roots probav
bly extend farther out than the
grower estimates; second, be
cause wide-spread fertilizing in
duces the roots to spread ; the
third, because the fertilizer be
tween the rows induces cover
crop growth. Furthermore, if
the cover crop is turned under
the plant food which it has taken
up will . probably be in better
form than it was originally.
When a heavy application is
limited to a small area under the
tree there is more danger of in
jury than when it is spread over
the broader area between the
rows. Cases have been observed
in which injury has boon appar
ently due to heavy applications
on limited space. This is espec
ially true of heavy applications
of readily available fertilizers.
Bankers' Association Recommend
Loans for Pig Clubs
The Agricultural Committee of
the Florida State Bankers' Asso
ciation submitted tho following
resolutions to the Association at
the meeting in Daytona, April 7
and 8:
"Deeming tho development of
the livestock industry or Flort'if
the most important subject be
fore our Committee, we have e
liminated all other propositions
and concentrated on the follow
ing resolutions, which we unani
mously passed and upon which
we now ask your favorable action
"iMrst, resolved that the bank
ers of each county bo requested
to jointly provide a fund from
which to make loans to members
of the boys' corn clubs with
which to purchase purebred pigs.
"Resolved further, that this
provision apply only to those
members who complete the corn ,
club work and who agree to keep
a pig under the rules and regula
tions formulated by the county
demonstration agent.
"On your passage of this reso
ution full particulars of how
county bankers organizations
can be perfected, and the terms
of agreement between the bank
ers and members of the boys'
club for the care of pigs, will be
sent to each banker by C. K. Mc
Quarrie, state agent for the Uni
vesity of Florida Extension Di
vision. These resolutions together with
others pertaining to cattle tick e
radication were adopted unani
mously by the Convention.
The Birth of the Potash
Industry in this Country
Potash salts were produced in
the United States in 1915 to the
value of $342,000, according to
the United States Geological Sur
vey. Though this figure is of in
terest as showing a small begin
ning in the domestic potash in
dustry, it becomes of little im
portance if the total needs of the
country are considered, tor it rep
resents a quantity consumed in
less than a week under normal
conditions.
Reduced Lmports
Tho imports of refined potasl
in 1915 were 76,141 long tons, or
slightly more than 25 per cent, of
those in 1913, the latest normal
vear of importation. Imports of
the potash fertilizers, kanute,
manure salts, amounted to 20,427
long tons, or about 3 per cent of
those in 1913. Taking all tho
potash salts together, the imports
in 1915 were about one-tenth of
those under normal conditions.
Progress in the Domestic Industry
In the Survey report on the
subject, W. C. Phalen states that
potash was recovered within the
United States as a by-product
from the manufacture of Port
land cement at Riverside, Cal. By
product potash from this source
has yielded a considerable reve
nue, owing to the abnormally
high price for these salts,
and in obtaining it two other pur
poses have been subserved first
the saving of additional material
to be converted into cement, and
second, tho elimination of the
dust nuisance. At Riverside a
discharge of 100 tons of dust a
day over the surrounding orange
groves has been prevented.
Potassium sulphate from alun-
ito was first placed on the market

GORDA'S PROGRESS
Enthusiastic Citizen Says the
Town Will Eventually An
nex Arcadia
"We are going to have a real
city at Punta Gorda some day,"
enthusiastically declared Mr. W.
R. Eubank, a representative of
the State Life Insurance Com
pany of Missouri, who was in
Wauchula Wednesday, "and it is
only a question of time when Pun
ta Gorda will annex Arcadia. I
was in Arcadia last Saturday and
it surprised me to see so few peo
ple on the streets. Saturday is a
big town day, you know, and that
is tho day when you expect more
people on the streets than any
other day, but last Saturday in
Arcadia, looked like a Sunday in
Punta Gorda. I had. some fun
out of several Arcadia fellows
who were in Punta Gorda Mon
day when I called their attention
to tho fact that there were more
people on the streets of Punta
Gorda that day and Monday is
the dullest day in the week, you
know than 1 saw in Arcadia on
Saturday. I told them that tho
only time I saw any kind of a
crowd in Arcadia was when they
had a dog fight. Oh, I had those
fellows goin', believe mo. Yes
siree, Punta Gorda is progressing.
We are now paving our principal
streets and building a bridge ov
er the river, and many other im
provements are rapidly making
us a live city. So, as I say, wo
will eventually annex Arcadia."
Wauchula Advocate.
Tho Times-Union reports Dan
l Alden Reed as saying that
"Florida presents the greatest
oportunity' to the young man of
any state in the Union." He said
further: "Your state is in the po
sition that some of the great mid
western states were thirty or
forty years ago. No state in the
Union has the groat opportunity
for growth and development that
Florida possesses. It only remains
for the men, and particularly the
young men, to take advantage of
it." Ocala Banner.
R. W. Conn and daughter, Miss
Louise, and cousin, Mrs. Maggie
Curry, after prolonging their
winter sojourn here, left Thurs
day to return to their home in
Louisville, Ky.
late in October, 1915, by the Min-
oral Products Corporation at
Marysvale, Utah. The produc
tion has not been large so far,
owing to the incidents connected
vith a pioneer enterprise of this
character. Though certain for
eign deposits of alunite have been
vorked for potash alum, this is
the first record yield of . potash
alls as such from alunite. Tho
product is of high grade. '
The plant of the Potash Pro
ducts Co., of Omaha, Nebr., was
established in the spring of 1915
at Hoffland, near Alliance, in the.
northwestern part of the State.
During about half of the year the
company obtained potash salts
from the brine of an alkaline lake
in this region.
In addition to output from tho
above sources, potash was mar
keted in 1915 from kelp obtained
along the Pacific coast.
Future Sources of Production
. Experimental work on the pro
duction of potash salts from dif
ferent sources was active during
the year, and in places this activ
ity has boon succeeded by the con
struction of plants. Operations
are in progress at Searles Lake
and at Keelcr, on the shores of
Owens Lake, Cal. It is report'
that one company is erecting a
plant near Groat Salt Lake and
that another will soon be started
at the south end of the lake. The
by-product bittern at solar evap
oration plants on San Francisco
Bay has also received some atten-.
tion. a
Another plant has been planned
for the extraction of potash salts
and alumina from alunite at
Marysvale, Utah. '
Manufacturers of Portland ce
ment, having had their attention
directed to a possible revenue
from by-product potash, will not
be slow in thoroughly investigat
ing their raw material. Already
the Security Cement & Lime Co.,
near Ilagerstown, Md., is report
ed to be installing a plant for the
recovery ot potash salts.
Great activity has been mani
fested in experiments for the re
covery of potash from the silicate
rocks, such as feldspar and leu
cite, from the mien sericite, and
from greonsand. The expense in
volved in obtaining potash salts
from those sources, together with
the uncertainties with which man
ufacturers will be confronted and
the keen German competition
likely to be met at the close of tho
war in Europe, have tended to
discourage chemical engineers
and capitalists. However, in
many laboratories researches
have been in progress, some of
which, according to reports, offer
prospects of profitable commer-
cial deevlopmont if feldspar and
other potash-rich rocks in suffi
cient quantity and purity can be
found and made available.
A small quantity of potash
salts was probably produced from
these, silicate rocks and minerals
during 1915 and found its way in- '
to mixed fertilizers without inter
mediate Refinement.
