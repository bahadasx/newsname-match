VISIT WILLISTON
FIFTH TOUR OF CIVIC ft COM
MERCE ASSOCIATION WILL
INCLUDE US—IN JUNE
Announcement has just been re
ceived from Minneapolis that Willis
ton is included in the itinerary of the
Fifth Annual Trade Tour of the Min
neapolis Civic and Commerce Asso
ciation which includes visits to forty
four towns and cities in North Dakota
and Montana.
This Association has become fa
mous through its annual trade excur
sions. Between ninety and one-hun
dred leading manufacturers, whole
salers, bankers and other business
men of the Northwest's chief city will
be members of the party which will
travel in a twelve-car special train.
They will carry a first class band and
battery of speakers.
The Minneapolis Civic and Com
merce Association always insists that
its excursions are in no sense junkets
or trade seeking parties. They are
arranged for two purposes first, to
promote a more cordial business and
social friendliness between the insti
tutions of that city and the commun
ity visited and, second, to enable the
principal members of the larger
wholesale firms in the city to get
better acquainted with the country
visited. This acquaintancship bene
fits not only Minneapolis but the ter
ritory through which the excursion
passes since it enables the cities and
towns to present their distinct ad
vantages to a select party of men who
are in position to assist materially in
their development.
The route this year lies over the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific
railroads, starting at Grand Forks on
the morning of Monday, June 5th, pro
ceeding westward over the main line
of the Great Northern to Havre,
thence South to Great Falls, Lewis
town and Billings. From Billings the
main line of the Northern Pacific will
be used, with stops at Forsyth, Miles
City aftd Glendive on Saturday, the
last day of the excursion.
While the route has been laid out
and practically all the stopping points
planned, definite hours of arrival and
time of 8tops have not been arranged
in all cases. E. C. Hillweg, an as
sistant secretary of the Association
who will have charge of the tour, will
make an. inspection trip within the
next ten days, to arrange all details
of the excursion. Upon his return to
Minneapolis definite announcement
will be made regarding the time of
arrival of the special in this city and
the progiam to be carried out here.

The Reply Logical—
From Bagder Senator
U. S. Senator Paul 0. Husting of
Wisconsin has sent a reply to the
"appeal for pe^ce" telegrams, that
are being showered upon senators at
Washington by the thousand, that is
causing no end of favorable comment
and promises to become historic.
The telegram with which United
States senators from certain middle
western states are being swamped,
reads as follows:
"We urge you to use effort to keep
this nation at peace."
Here is the reply that Mr. Husting
sent back to his constitutents:
"No one is more desirous of
keeping this country out of war
than I am, but war can best be
avoided by wrong yielding to right
and not by right yielding to
wrong. Would therefore suggest
that you also wire the German
ambassfdor of the fervent desire
of all Americans that their coun
try remain at peace and that
peace can best be preserved by
the strict observation on the part
of the imperial government of the
provisions of international law
governing naval warfare.
"Would further suggest that
you wire the ambassador that all
Americans, regardless of their
ancestry or sympathies, stand
solidly back of their government
in this crisis."
The telegrams to senators being all
worded the same are open to the sus
picion of being backed by some sort
of organization and Senator Husting's
reply exactly fits.

COURT
IRMSFER
HOLDS
OF SCHOOL FIDS LEGAL
UNANIMOUS OPINION BY SU
PREME COURT UPHOLDS
FORKS SCHOOL BOARD
A decision just handed down by the
state supreme court in the Grand
Forks injunction case may have an
important bearing on situations con
fronting other public boards, both
municipal and county. The following
report of the decision is taken from
the Grand Forks Herald of the 2Gth:
The supreme court of North Dakota
today dissolved the injunction, made
permanent in December by Judge
Pollock of Fargo, retraining the
Grand Forks board of education from
erecting a new high school building.
The decision, which declares that
the transfer of money from the teach
ers' to the general fund is not illegal,
was written by Justice Burke, and all
justices concurred.
The syllabus of the court follows:
"An action to restrain the school
board of Grand Forks independent
school district from carrying out a
contract for the erection of a high
school building, because certain funds
had been diverted from the purpose
for which they had been levied and
that without such funds, said contract
creates a debt in excess of the con
stitutional limit.
"Held, that the transfer of funds
from the teachers' to the general fund
in this case is not prohibited by sec
tion 175, of the constitution, North
Daokta."
Decision by Burke, J., all justices
concurring.
Justice Burke's decision, in part,
follows:
"Not only the authority but the
dictates of common sense impel us to
hold, as we do, that incidental bal
ances levied in good faith and for the
sanje general purpose, when the orig
inal has been served, they can be
transferred from one minor account
to another without violating question
175 of our constitution. For instance,
if a certain school board made a levy
of $1,000 for repairs for a current
year and thereafter afire occurred,
doing damage to the amount of $2,000
would it be contended that, the school
building must remain unrepaired for
another year until $1,000 in addition
could be levied and raised, while
there was $1,000 surplus in the sink
ing fund accumulated in good faith and
not needed for that purpose. Further
more, if the strict conception demand
ed by plaintiffs were allowed it would
prevent the transfer of money levied
to pay the teachers in 1914 to a fund
to pay the same teachers in 1915.
"It must be kept in mind also that
this is not an action through a decline
for levy of a tax to prevent its collec
tion, but is an action to restrain the
fulfillment of a contract by the Board
for the erection of a school building.
"Section 130 of the constitution,
which, by the way, is not found in all
the states having a section similar to
section 175, reads:
"The legislative assembly shall pro
vide by general law for the organiza
tion of a municipal corporation re
stricting their powers as to levying
taxes and assessments, borrowing
money and contracting debts and mon
ey raised by taxation, loan or assess
ment for any purpose shall not be di
verted to any other purpose except
by authority of law.'
"If this section applies to school
corporation ,and we believe it does,
it and not section 175 governs this
case.
"It is our conclusion, therefore, that
section 175 of the constitution does
not apply to cases like the first.
Therefore, a court of equity ought not
and will not in this case interfere.
The judgment of the trial court is re
versed."
History of the Case
The case had its origin a year ago
when the school board passed a reso
lution providing for the erection of a
new high school building.
A number of citizens protested
against this action on the grounds
that the site was unwisely selected,
the cost of the building too great and
the school board not in a position fi
nancially to incur such expense.
The board, however, proceeded to
award contracts for the erection of
the building, its action being unheld
by a majority of the voters of the city
at a special election held for that pur
pose.
Injunction Issued
The citizens of Grand Forks who
objected to the erection of the build
ing at that time started court pro

OTHER BATTLE
Field Headquarters, April 26.—
Two Americans were killed and three
wounded in an engagement between
cavalrymen under Colonel George A.
Dodd, and 260 Villa bandits, at To
machic, in the center of Sierra Mad
res, in western Chihuahua, April 22,
according to an official report reach
ing here.
The Villa command, under four
chiefs, Baca, Cervantes, Dominguen
and Rios, was surprised in the late
afternoon and routed. After the bat
tle the Americans found six dead
Mexicans and nineteen wounded,
while a quantity of horses, arms and
equipment was captured.
El Paso, April 26.—The report has
been received here that Colonel Dodd's
advanced cavalry detachment had an
engagement several days ago in which
both sides suffered losses. It is not
indicated whether the battle was with
Villa bands or with Carranza troops.
Field Headquarters, Namiquipa,
Chihuahua, April 26.—Several detach
ments of American troops have re
sumed active pursuit of Villa and are
whipping the mountains northwest of
Parral, where Villa is reported to be
hiding.
The advanced base, 300 miles south

equipped and trainload after train
load of motor trucks have arrived

rations, clothing and equipment.
Information regarding the battle
came in a private dispatch. Ad
vanced detachments of Colonel Dodd's
cavalry recently have been operating
north of Satevo.
Officials of the Carranza govern
ment are optimistic in the belief that
the conference of General Obregon
and General Scott will result in peace
on the border. Pending the confer
ence, the bases and lines of communi
cation of the American army are be
ing strengthened for any eventuality.

DIRECTORS CALL
GENERAL MEETM6
PUBLIC MEETING TUESDAY,
MAY 2—IMPORTANT COMMER
CIAL CLUB BUSINESS
The working plans of the directors
of the commercial club have reached
a stage where it is advisable to lay
certain important matters before the
general body of citizens. The sub
committee appointed to arrange for
a general meeting issues a call for
Tuesday, May 2, at the court house, at
8 o'clock p. m.
Large Attendance Imperative
It is the greatest importance that
a large and representative attendance
answer this call. Every man sin
cerely interested in the work of the
club and the welfare of the city
should be on hand. Matters of deep
importance will be presented.
It is understood that the question
of a paid secretary is at a point where
the man whom the directors consider
the most desirable of several available
men considered can be secured at once.
President Jackson returned Sunday
after a two weeks stay in the cities
and had an interesting report to make
at the Monday evening meeting of the
directors.
Do

Tuesday, at the court house, at 8 p. m.
CIVIC LEAGUE MEETING

tate Historical Sac XX
A1 Jennings History
Shown On The Screen
The dramatization of "Beating
Back," written by A1 Jennings and
Will Irwin in the Saturday Evening
Post, being the life history of the
most unique character in American
history, is endorsed by Press, Pulpit,
and Prison Reform Societies as being
of infinite good in teaching the great
fundamental principle of American
life—Equality of every man.
In this picturization of A1 Jen
nings' career (Orpheum, May 1 and
2) we see a man—a human like the
rest of us—fallen to the lowest
depths, an outlaw, train robber, and
ultimately a convict—then pardoned
by broad-minded President McKinley
and given another chance at making
good.
We see him return to his native
sta,te, where the fellowship of his
former friends is denied him—the
cold shoulder of disrespect turned on
him, but Mr. Jennings, whom a New
York critic declared a "human dy
namo" was not to be daunted, for
during the dismal nights between
prison walls and during the hard days
of labor and oppression under prison
masters, this little man, erstwhile
outlaw and terror of the Oklahoma
hills, made a resolve to travel the
straight and narrow way and upon
his release from prison to point out
to the coming generations the fallacy
of wrong-doing.
We see him working his way back
into the good graces of his old friends
and neighbors we see him with the
one suit that was given him upon
leaving prison worn into tatters,
pleading with Judge Gillett of Law
ton, to permit him to practice in his
court. (He had been prior to his out
lawry an attorney at law). We see
him winning the case in the court of
Judge Gillett, which started him on
his feet in a financial way we see him
graciously ignoring the rubuffs of his
old, and may we say hypocritical
comrades, until through persistant
hammoring at the gates of society,
having been recognized, we see him
running for the highest office in his
state, governor of Oklahoma. Why
shouldn't it be if there is anything
in Christianity, if there is anything
in lending a hand to the fallen broth
er, why then is it not hypocrisy for
any man or woman to condemn A1
Jennings, who has beaten back, buried
his corrupt past and come forth with
full ropentance in quest of the pub
lic's recognition, which his trem
endous vote for governor proves he
has received to a large extent, if not
altogether.
"Beating Back'' comes to the Or
pheum theatre Monday and Tuesday,
May 1 and 2 and wherever it has been
shown the people have been turned
away by the hundreds.
For The Attention
Of Property Owners
all
out houses, and other places on the
premises are placed in a sanitary con
dition. Beginning on May 8th, a
minute inspection of all premises in
the City will be made and any failure
to comply with the spirit of this no
tice will be reported for proper ac
tion. Every citizen owes a duty to
himself, his family, his neighbors and
the City to see that premises occu
pied by him are placed and kept in a
neat and sanitary condition, therefore,
by May 6th the latest, let every one
have performed that duty and help
thereby to make Williston what it
should be the cleanest and best City
in the State to dwell in.

President Board of Commissioners,

FINE ENDORSEMENT FOR
"GOVERNOR" BURDICK
COURT ROOM PACKED WITH:
FARMERS AND TOWN PEOPLE
—PRINCIPLES APPLAUDED
The most enthusiastic political
gathering seen in many moons in Wil
liston was held at the court house last
night.
The Burdick For Governor club had
issued a call for a home endorsement
meeting in the interest of Usher L.
Burdick, Williston's candidate for
governor, and the response was all
that could have been asked. Nearly
half the audience was composed of
farmers who left their work to come
and hear the "farmer's friend" ex
pound the principles on which he is
basing his campaign.
This is a farmers' fight on farmers*
issues and that the farmers in at
tendance last night felt their faith in
the local farmer candidate fully jus
tified was emphatically shown by
their frequent and loud applause and
the congratulations they extended
Mr. Burdick at the close of the mMt»
ing.
Program of Good Speeches
W. B. Overson, as president of the
Burdick for Governor Club, presided
and opened the meeting with some
valuable suggestions touching on the
work the club sought to accomplish
and some of the methods by which
the people of the city and county and
nearby counties could assist in the
work. Mr. Overson suggested that
all friendly to Mr. Burdick's can
didacy write letters to friends in oth
er parts of the state telling why our'
man is worthy of support.
Hon. Robert Norheim was expected
to be present to represent McKenzie
county but did not reach here, prob
ably on account of the roads in the
ri^er bottom. The chairman called on'
W. .Owens who responded with a
fifteen minute speech. He said th«1
whole republican party in North Da
kota was now "progressive."' He1
demanded to know why such sterling'
farmers, of long residence, unques
tioned ability, and tested faithfulness'
to farmer interests as John Steen and
Usher L. Burdick had been passed up
by the non-partisan league leaders
who posed as champions of the Arm
ers' cause.
W. W. Keltner, made a rousing ad-'
dress. Speaking as a farmer for the
farmers of the community he lauded
Mr. Burdick the man who had done
more, through his agitation of such.',
issues as a lower interest rate, for the
farmer and the poor man than anj~
other man in the state. He advised
the writing of Burdick endorsement
letters. He said he had already writ
ten 21 such himself, and was roundly
applauded.
H. W. Braatelien was the next
speaker. He began by saying he had
just spent several days in Divide
county and had not met a man who
was not for Burdick for governor.
He cited a strong array of reasons
why the local man should be nornm*
ated and why he would be.
Mr. Burdick then took the floor and'
spoke for over an hour. Beginning
with the framing of the constitution
he outlined the political history of
our country and entered into the
fundamentals of his political beliefs
and principles. It was a broad, lib
eral convincing argument it war
a speech marked by eminent fairness
to all factions and its periods were
frequently met by applause.
Mr. Burdick's address was taken by
a stenographer and will be given in
full in an early issue.
Burdick For Governor
Club Was Organized
Friday evening local republicans,
enthusiastic in their support of U. L.
Burdick for governor, met and or
ganized the parent Burdick For Gov
ernor club. The purpose of the or
