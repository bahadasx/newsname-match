CHARLES S. PATTERSON
FOR TOWN MARSHAL
To my many friends
have solicited me to
come a candidate
Town Marshal. 1
who
Ladies and Gentlmen: ' i
I am gratified beyond measure at
your assurances of confidence and
support in urging me to become a
candidate for Town Marshal. You
and scores of you bave insisted
that it 13 a duty I owe the com
munity to make this race: and
after a full consideration of the
conditions confronting us, I am
now ready to give you my final
answer, and at the same time, state
my reason for the same.
1 have studied the situation
" very carefully in order to deter
min just what my obligations are
to the community in which I live,
own property, educate my child,
and in which I expect to continue
to live. Frankly, I can find no
good reason why I should not be
come a candidate but, upon the
other hand, I find many, many
good reasons why, I should be your
next Town Marshal.
If I as a citizen and taxpayer
were satisfied and utterly indiffer
ent to conditions that now exist in
our little town, I would hesitate to
enter this contest. For I am ''not
seeking this office, nor do I respond
to your appeals, merely from a
selfish standpoint of personal gain.
I know what you want: I know
what kind of a man you want, for
you have told me; and for that
reason L now consent to become
your candidate for Marshal. -
You want a man for Marshal
whom you deem honorable and
upright and for whom every citizen
has or should have respect and
confidence. v
You want a manfor Marshal
who will not, with the prestige of
his office, brow-beat unfortunate
women into dealing with firms
which otherwise they probably
would not patronize.
You want a man for. Marshal
who does not act for the agent " of
the owner of the only immoral' re
sort in our town.
You 'want a man for Marshal
who will not use the prestige of the
' office given him by the people, to
collect exorbitant rent from un
fortunate women of the underworld
and send it to a tin-horn gambler
in a distant state who has a num
ber of indictments pending against
' him in that state, for violating its
-laws.
In concluding I wish to say that
in my opinon it is time for us to
have a moral as well as a physical
cleaning up of the town. The
snow plow and mule team are al
right, provided they are not util
ized to pave the way to the most
disgraceful den of iniquity that
.ever cursed a civilized community,
as the cinder path to the Hill.
Will testify. It makes pretty easy
walking for the Boot-leggera.
There are four things that you.
.by your votes, can accomplish- at.
the eleetion on May 22, which will
have a greater tendency to stop
Boot-legging, clean up the town,
and make it wafer and better to
live in than anything else that can
be done.
Those four things are as follows:
Vote to remove forever all immoral
places of resort; Vote to remove the
four lectric street lights for which
the town pays twenty , dollars per
month to light the path to these
immoral resorts, and place these
four lights in the business or resi
dence portion of the town, where
they rightfully belong; Vote to
stop your street commissioner from
using the town ttam to build cin-
WATER GO. MAKES
T
The Williams Water & Elec
tric Company is now making two
important changes in the man
agement of their business. In
the first pla e they are fixing a
definite time for the payment of
service bills, and in the second
place they are arranging to
make the charge for water ex
actly proportionate to the amount
of water used.
The News has just printed for
the water and electric company,
a circular letter to its patrons in
forming them that beginning
with June, bills for service, both
for water and electricity, will be
due and payable on or before the
10th of each month. That is to
say May bills will be payable not
later 'than June 10. This has
become the custom almost uni
versally with public service com
panies, both private and munici
oal. It enables a company to
meet its own bills promptly and
puts it in a position to give bet
ter service at a minimum cost.
As Mr. Morley, general mana
ger of the Williams company,
stated, the local company has to
pay for its fuel in advance and
for the labor to operate its plant,
twice a month, so that the comp
any cannot afford to carry ac
counts as has sometimes been
the case. '
In order to make the charge
for water proportionate to the
service rendered, water meters
.are to be used, ine company
has at its office a sample of the
meter which they are about to
install. This is one of the best
and most accurate in use any
where for private residences.
It was chosen from among a
large number of samples and
costs fifty per cent more than
others that are used in a great
many towns and cities.
Under the old flat rates it fre
quently happened that patrons
with small familes or with little
ground to water, paid as much
as other water , users who con
sumed more water. The use of
an accurate meter insures im
partial service to all. JNo one
can object to the use of meters
unless the meters are inaccurate
or the price is excessive. The
work done by the. type of meter
the local company ha3 adopted,
meets the approval of the . corp
oration commission, and Mr.
Morley states that tt e rates will
be made the same as those in
Flagstaff.
coth oi these changes are in
accord with good business and
tair cieahng. ine JNews is in
formed that the present owners
are planning other improve
ments.
Delivery Mule Severiy Injured
Ihe team of mules belonging to
Duffy Bros,., became frightened on
the railroad crossing, near the
freight house, Wednesday. Before
they were calmed, the tongue to
the delivery wagon had been brok'
en and one of the mules ran i
large sliver about three and a half
inches long in its foot. Mr. II. J
Flummer, our local veterinary
surgeon, extracted the sliver and
stited that the mule woul j be laid
up for about two months. .Except
for a broken tongue, the wagon
was not damaged.
der walks to these immoral resorts
and finall', vote for a Town Mar
shal who will enforce these
measures when enacted in the law
hi closing I wish to say if I am
elected fir Town Marshal oa Mav
22nd, 1916,1 promise you that I will,
to the very bust of my ability
carry these reforms into effect.

Return from Winter Pasture
Three, car-loads of horses arrived
last Saturday morning, from Phoe
nix, where they had been sent for
the winter pasture. Among them
were horses for Messrs. Boyce,'
Williams, and T. F. Holden. All
were fat and in the pink of condit
ion. They had been running on
alfalfa pasture. As the shipping
rate and fee for a pasturage - were
very reasonable, it is probable that
a yet larger number will be winter
ed in Phoenix next winter.
Orphan to County Hospital.
Last Saturday morning a litt'e
Mexican girl, eight or nine years
old, who had been brutally beat
en and abused by her guardian,

G. Rounseville, and sent onto
the county hospital for treat
ment. The brutal guardian is
serving a jail sentence.
BIG YEAR AHEAD
FOR joy SCOOTS
Great Muster Meeting Next
Saturday Starts an Active
Year for Boys, Full of
Work and Good Times.
The Boy's Department of the
Men's Civic League, met last
Saturday and planned their work
for the next six months. They
decided to affiliate with the Boy
Scouts of America and to devote
their energies exclusively to
Scout work among the Boys of
the community, during the next
six months. An effort will be
made to raise a fund of $600 to
assist in the work, and with it's
aid the boys will be given a
course in swimming, boating,
camp cooking, woodcraft, nature
study, civic improvement, busi
ness, and many other scout stud
ies. The work is open to al' boys
without cost to themselves, and
boys will have an equal chance,
regardless of the financial stand
ing of their parents.
In the effort to see that each
boy has an ' equal opportunity
with every other boy, uniforms,
badges, bands and banners .will
be supplied by the Troop Com
mittee and awarded to the Scouts
as marks , of merit, free of cost
to the boys. Those boys who
prove most faithful in scout work
will be the first to receive their
uniforms. All parents are invit
ed to make contributions to the
Troop Committee, but not direct
ly to the boys.
It's going to be ten times bet
ter to be a Scout this year tharr
it was last year, and so all boys
between the ages of 12 and 18,
should make it a point to be
present at the great muster meet
ing to be held on the school
house steps, next Saturday morn
ing at 10 o'clock. Each boy
should come equipped with a
Scout walking staff, and with
enough "grub" , to appease his
own hunger after a hike of sev
eral miles.
Scout officers
Scout officers were- elected as
follows:
( C. H. Appleton
Troop Com- Rev. Boone
mittee ( Rev. Hoffpauir
Scout Master, F. E. Wells
Asst. Scout Master, A. Boenitsch

MUSIC CLUB MEETS
An unusually . interesting and
well attended meeting of the
Music Club was held at the home
of Mrs. Rittenhouse, April 25th.
The composer, whose life and
compositions were studied, was
Charles Cadman and Mrs. Ritten
house was in charge of the pro
gram. One fact of special note
in Cadman's work has been his
extensive study of the Indians
and their lives as interpreted by
their musi Cadman has been
most successful jn his work along
these lines and his Indian songs
have wTide reputation.
Thirty-four persons1 were pre
sent, including the members of
the High School. A very good
program was rendered and en
joyed by all.

of Odd Fellows, celebrated the 97th
anniversary of the organization,
lust Monday night, with a dance
and a banquet. The attendance
was good, the eals siiil hotter and
the music and dancing were of the
same order so that withal a very
I pleasant evening was passed.
COUNCIL IS DRAFTED .
10 DON RAGE AGAIN
The members of the present
Town Council have been drafted
candidates for re-election at the
coming town election. None of
the councilmen desired to '. make
the race but so general has been
the satisfaction which their ad
ministration of municipal affairs
has brought forth, that the citi
zens of the town would listen to
nothing else. At last all five as
a body, have yielded to the pres
sure and have consented to let
their names appear on the ballot.
The people of Williams will learn
of this fact with a great deal of
satisfaction. '; , ;
For three months the only re
ply which it has been possible to

have for town councilmen, ?" has4
heen. "What's the mntrpr vath
the present council? They have

The only remuneration a coun

the nresenr. rnnnc.ii has. this sil
