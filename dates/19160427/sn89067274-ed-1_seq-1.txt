REFERRING to the agitation tak

of law enforcement, the Index of that
city editorially says: ',We have heard
many comments on the proposition
of cleaning out the' gambling houses
the prostitution and the unlawful
pool halls, and with the exception at
thou directly Interested in the pro
ceeds of these iniquities, the universal
opinion seems to be that they should
p; that they are not desirable insti
tutions fof this or any other eom
unityi that they & not mK "00,
advsrtinlng copy to extol our com
nimity advantages to the world.
It has been intimated that there
art certain ones of the community
who believe that the laws of the state
of Uiwouri and the ordinaneea of the
City at Moberly should be, forgotten
fototer as they relate to gambling,
prostitution and kindred evils.
"For the benefit of those who hav
ing eyes see not, and having ears
heir not, we would suggest that each
and every citizen of Moberly and
Randolph county who is in favor of
the elimination of the useless institu
tions of thia community known as
gambling houses, bawdy houses and
unlawful pool halls talk out loud for a
day or two and watch the results.
"If all the darkness in the world
was gathered into a room and a single
electric light Switched on the dark
ness would disappear."

Youth, Who is Thought to be Suffering With
Mental Trouble, Identified at Scene
At the time of going to press Harry Mcintosh, wanted
for the attempted hold-up of the Mexico Savings Bank at
noon Wednesday, had not been arrested. Mcintosh is
thought to be suffering from mental trouble by members
of his family. He is reported to have passed through
Francis and the officers are seeking him near Littleby
Station.
has been working in Warrenton but
has been home on a visit for some
time. " - ,
All of the banks are especially care
ful to see that at least two persons
are on guard during the noon hour
just for auch contingencies as this
and carry insurance againr robbers.
Mcintosh is said to have tried to bor
row money to get to Kansas City on
Tuesday but failed. He is said to have
had the revolver on him Saturday
night. Claibourn Jackson and T. J.
Williams met Mcintosh walking leis
urely out Monroe street as they came
from dinner. He was apparently in
no hurry to escape.
An old hunting coat, containing a
flour sack and a checked cap were
found hidden in a corner of the second
story of the building after the affair.
Joel Guthrie, who was the target
for the robber's gun tells his story:
"I was taking off my hat and coat
when I heard someone order my hands
up. I turned and saw a small masked
figure, holding a gun in a rather
shaky hand. I thought he was joking
and went to the rack and hung my
coat and hat up. . As I turned about
I found he had followed me and was
about three feet away pointing the
gun at my head. He held the gun
pointing at me several seconds before
he fired.. Not until he shot did I sus
pect ,he was in earnest"
New Suits.
W. L. Fowles has filed suit against

Firing within six inches of Joel
Guthrie's head and forcing Guthrie
to precede him into the front room of
the Mexico Savings Bank about one
o'clock Wednesday afternoon) a mask
ed robber lost his nerve and Ted when
the bank funds were within two feet
of him.
Mr. Guthrie, who is learning book
keeping was in the rear room of tho
bank. Suddenly his attention was at
tracted by someone entering and when
he looked up it waa to gaze down the
barrel of a 38 caliber revolver held
in the hand of a short man, wearing
a blue a .id white mask. Before Mr.
Guthrie could apeak the intruder fired
the bullet passing within four inches
of his head. . . '
He ordered Mr. Guthrie to precede
him into the the enclosure in the front
room where the funds of the bank
were spread upon the counter to fa
cilitate business.
Walker Burns and Sam Sharp were
also in the enclosure. Mr. Burns ran
through the froi.t entrance toward
the street to give the alarm and when
the robber waa within two feet of the
money and holding Mr. Jesse at bay
with his gun, he seemed to lose his
nerve and turned and fled. J. M.
Jones of Thompson and Major
Hothoro of M. M. A. were in the bank
at the time. i
Harry Stocks, whose office is at
the head of the rear stairway, entered
the building without any knowledge
of the attempted holdup. When he
reached the door of his office he saw
a boy standing there with a revolver
in his hand. .. He stopped and asked
the youth what he was doing but re
ceived no reply. The boy turned and
walked away. Mr. Stocks entered
his office and then saw the boy start
down the rear stairway. When he
waa at this point Mr. Sharp emerged
from the rear door of the bank and
recognized him as Harry Mcintosh.
Wht:i Mr. Sharp spoke he turned and
fled up the stairs.
Prosecuting Attorney A. C. Whit
son ran to the second story of the
building up the front stairway
which is between Craddock's and Wil
klns & Brown's stores. He met Har
ry Mcintosh, the nineteen year old
son of Mr. and Mrs. B. F. Mcintosh of
this city, there. He looked frightened
and when he saw Mr. Whitson turned
and ran in 'the opposite direction. A
mask was found in front of Dr. Pas
quoth's office shortly afterward.
Mr. Whitson thought the boy had
seen the robber and was frightened
so continued to search further.
Mr. Sharp said he recognized Mc
Intosh as the hold-up man when he
took off hia mask as he climbed the
in escaping. Mr. Mcintosh
