Master Roney, Outlining Plans
Also Proposes Carnival
and Dance on Streets.
Henry It. Roney of ChkaKo, who
has been appointed pageant m:tster
and musical director of the t. Jo
seph county celebration of the In
diana centennial, gave a talk on
v. hat he expected to do here and
heard a brief outline of the plans
that already have been made, at a
meeting and luncheon of all of the
pageant mniittees at the high
school Thursday noon. Plans were
made for a. meeting of representa
tives of every organization in the
county on May 4 at S o'clock at the
high school.
Mr. Honey's preliminary plans for
the local celebration include a
marked carnival and dance on the
down town streets. The participants
will he dressed in costumes of every
description and prizes will be given
Tor the best representations of his
torical characters and the most
handsome and grotesque costumes?.
Tliis event probably will come on
the last night of the celebration.
Mr. Honey suggested that a chorus
made up of ä.OiMi children be used
in putting on the pageant. He said
that lie would appear in every scene
during the pageant at Sprinabrook
park and that he would have assist
ant!, properly costumed, to deliver
messages to various parts of the
amphitheater in order to have every
event staped at the riKht time. A
telephone system will be installed at
the park to allow Mr. Rony to keep
in touch with all sections of the
place.

The meeting to he held on May I
will be held to secure the coopera

"Of all intolerable faults of ptes

JiNhoX. April 27. Dublin hrs
been brought under the guns of
British warships that have anchor
ed in I'ublin bay. It is believed,
however, that the military author
ities have th revoluntionary situa
tion so well under control in the
Irish capital that it will not be
necessary to :ire upon the city.
Keport.s tluvt the rebels had sack
ed part of Ihiblin wa.s given of
ficial cognizance when Premier As
quit h announ.ed that there was no
reason to believe that the banks
were unsafe. The government . and
tinancia! institutions in the Irish
capital are guarded by troops and
machine gun-? have been mounted
upon roofs of many buildings to
sweep the streets.
The, proclamation stating that
civil war has been suspended makes
it evident that the Sinn Feiners. who
took part in the uprising will he
tried for sedition and some of the
leaders may be tried for treason.
The milit iry authorities have
made progress In putting down the
uprising. The troops are making
many arrests and all of the county
of Iublin is being disarmed.
Search SusiKX'ts Hoiihcs.
Houses of suspects are being
searched and a ' number of news
papers have been suppressed by the
lord lieutenant.
The -ase of Sir Roger Casement,
the Irish nobleman who wa.s cap
tured while trying to smuggle arms
into Ireland, is closely interwoven
with the present rebellion and the
armed clash in the streets of Dub
lin may hav considerable Influence
with the government in relation to
Sir Rofrer.
As a result of the present hiffh
state of feeling the trial of the
Irish knight may be put off for
some time, or at least until the un
rest in sout. nern Ireland has sub
sided somewnat.
The Kx press suggests the possi
bility that Sir Hoger may be be
headed if fcund guilty, but in other
quarters the belief exists that it
would be wiser to treat Sir Boger
with leniency as was the case in
South Africa when Hen. De Wet. the
leader of the Boer rebels was cap-
t u red.
Sir Roger's case is different,
however, as regards the political
aspect. It is understood that papers
implicating prominent Irishmen
w ei found upon his person.
From the official reports and
fragmentary unofficial reports it N
believed that the total casualties in
Dublin and Dublin county during
the fighting on Monday and Tuesday
were at leas? K'O.
I car CivH War.
That the government feared that
the uprising might spread into
civil w ar was shown by th sp ed
with which 'roops and artillery was
moved into Ireland from Krida nd.
There are said to be at least C'o'.fuMi
soldiers undjr arms in all parts of
Ireland at tie present moment and
preparations have heen made l.v
the war office- to send more if need
ed. In official cJrcUs la-lief is ex-
press-d that tranquilitv will be re
stored in outhern Ireland very
soon, althovgh. the uprising will
leave behind . more bitter hatred
thin existed before and In its wake
will follow i condition of affairs
that will make It necessary for Krc
land to maintain strong bodies of
troops In the island for any future
emergence .
Ixjrd WlnrV-rne, the lord lieuten
ant of Ireland, Is makinj? every ef
fort to restore per.ee and he will
probably have the rodp of Augustine
Birrell. secretary for Ireland, very
so.,n. Mr. BirreM' mission to Ire
land, it Is understood, is to study
the fituatioi at flrfd hand and to
parley with leaders of the separa
tist. The Irish situation is holdir.g

is taking a prominent p'.Te in the
deliberations of parliament.
