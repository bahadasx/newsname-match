Washington. April 26. An official
declaration of the attitude of the
tnitcd States toward armed merchant
ships, made public today by Secretary
Lansing, reiterates and explains the.

the conditions under which the Unit
ed State's holds submarines mny at
tack merchant craft.
Answer In Advance.
The declaration was Issued in the
form of a memorandum prepared by
Mr. Lansing at President Wilson's di
rection during the secretary's brief
vacation Inst month. Copies of it
were given ta each of the embassies
and legations here, and while no of
ficial explanation was forthcoming as
to the purpose of publishing the mem
orandum at this time, It is assumed
that at least the substance of it will
rnarh the Berlin foreign office before
a reply is dispatched to the American
demand for abandonment of Ger
many's present methods of submarine
warfare. This would serve to answer
In advance certain questions, which
cable dispatches have indicated the
Oermnn government was Inclined to
ask.
British Morehaiit Ships.
In connection with the memoran
dum it was stated that the state de
partment pow was awaiting a re
fponpe fmnf Creut Britain to a-" re
quest for copies of orders to armed
tiritish merchant vessels. Germany
has charged that these ships were in
structed to act aggressively against
submarines and has submitted photo
graphic copies of orders taken some
months ago from captured craft. This
evidence Is not considered conclusive
here, however, us the United States
will Imse its position on orders now In
effect. .
One Compact .Statement.
During the long drawn out nego
tiations following the sinking of the
Lusitania, . Secretary Lansing has
stated In general terms nearly all of
the postulates which he lays down in
today's declaration. It was deter
mined, however, to gather these

i
The I nlted Slates' Position.
An effort is made to differentiate
between an armed ship in a tieutral
part and the same vessel on the high
seas, la the first case, it Is shown
that the United States government
is concerned solely to protect Itself
against any charges that might be
made by one of the 'belligerents that
it bus allowed American ports to bo
used as a base for hostile operations
by Us enemy. Mr. Lansing insists
that the neutral government is to bo
the sole judge of the status of armed
''hips in its ports In the absence of
nay settled rule of international law.
A commission or orders from a bellig
erent government to conduct aggres
sive operations under penalty of pun
ishment for failure so to do would
stamp the vessel as a warship.
Neutral Is Solo Judge.
In the absence of such evidence, the
neutral government may lay down its
nw'n rules of evidence and determine
the character of the ship and, more
over, these rules, unlike principles of
International law, may be changed or
modified during the progress of the
vur.
Commenting on this portion of the
memorandum, a high official of the
state department admitted that the
refusal of the American port author-
hies to clear a vessel might be taken
as a notice to the public that she
was regarded as "a warship not entl

point out to General obregon that tho
most effective way to obtuln early
withdrawal of tho American forces
from Mexico would be to lend all pos

With his elimination, either by Amer

the Washington government would
agree to an Immediate retlrtiment of
the expedition across tliu border.
It would be made clear In this con
neolion that I'nited States officers
have no doubt of their ability to cap
