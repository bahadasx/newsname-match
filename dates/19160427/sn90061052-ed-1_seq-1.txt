delegation to Liberty Schoolhouse in

The building Is well kept inside and
out showing the prosperity and prog
ress of the people A good crowd of
farmers and their families were present
Right here let us- say that tho attend
ance and cooperation of the women is
very much desired in fill these meet
ings We believe the encouragement
nnd enthusiasm of the women Is abso
lutely essential to success In this work
The band enlivened the occrsion with
three selections
The meeting was called to order by
President C L Hayzlett and W H
Metegcr was elected chairman ii W
Scott was i the speaker of the evening
Mr Scott attended school afterwards
taught and participated in the school
house debates in that section a num
ber of years ago and many of his old
time friends were present and congrat
ulated him upon liis speech It was a
good speech from every angle dealing
principally withGoverment flgures and
statistics on many phases of the good-
joads problem and emphasizing tho
need of community interest through
local clubs having social features as
well as business
Mr Hayzlett W C Thomas X H
Patterson Dr Knott L T McCune
Bert Webb A F Drake and Kd Con
roy responded to the call of the chair
man along dilTeicnt phases of the sub
ject under consideration
At the close of the speaking the
most important part of the meeting
took place the part without which the
occasion would have been almost
fruitless the organization of n com
munity club W H Meizgerwas
named as president and Ralph Rerry
secretary of the permanent organiza
tion Fourteen members signed their
names to the roll and a meeting was
appointed for next Saturday night at
which a committee on by laws will be
appointed and further organization
effected
The flnal result of the meeting was
exceedingly gratifying to the Jasper
Commercial Club as the real purpose
of these trips to the country is to so
stimulate enthusiasm thnt clubs may
be formed throughout he country
giving the Jasper club and the country
clubs organizations through which ef
fectual cooperation may be obtained to
the great benefit of all concerned
Let the good work proceed
