Written Repoirt of Miss Lilliai
Mlason on 'Trip to Farmers
Sihl't (Course.
"Of the one hundred and twen
ty student, who attended tht
Winter Short Course of the Loui
siana State University there werf
seventy-eight boys and forty
seven girls. These young people
were chosen fr:,m 7000 corn, pig
canning and poultry club mem
bers, for having attained more
than ordinary success in the clul
work. This is not the firs
course of its kind that has beer
given by the University and each
year, due to the success tha
has already been made, it i: be.
ing broadened. The boys wert
offered lodging, at a reduced
price at the University for the
ten o':.ys, and the girls lived in
town with private families, taking
their mealb at the University din
ing hall."
"'The work of the boys cousist
ed principally of lectures, dem
onstrations etc., to give thew in
struction in the raising of farm
crops and live stock. Improved
farming implements and the very
best type of live stock were used
for these demonstrations. The
girls were divided into sections
and classes were organized in
aewi'g, cooking. butter making,
homie pursing and household
manaeement. These sections
mumbered 1, 2 and 3 were given
four periods each day, varying
from on to two and one half hours
in length. In the butter making
process, every detail of making
of the butter, from the seperating
-t'9fthe cream from the milk to the
wr.,pping of the butter for mar
ket, was taken up. In the eaok
ing, ma ny valuable recipes were
given in ;'he serving of luncheons,
which were served by the club
girls to the m'embers of the facul.
ty, every day.
Only a brief course was given
in home nursing. For the sew
ing work, each girl %vas provided
with a dress pattern and required
to make a simple dress. These
-dresses were to be worn at club
aneetings and to serve as a uni
form. The girls received special
training in the making of labor
saving devices for the home."
"Throughout the entire course
one period each day was devoted
to the study of English and re
portwriting. Most of the boys
and girls came from rural dis
u 'triots and the instructions that
they :eroiv,! a t the Short Course
will enable them to carry on their
club work in a more intelligent
.- and profitable manner. The new
e ideas and strandards that they
gained will not only be a hel,; to
e them but to their entire commu
,. nity."

P. B. CARTER OUT'
: FOR ATTORNEY JOB
t
n Judge Prentis B. Carter, of
h Franklintom, is an aspirant for
it the place of assistant attorney
general made vacant by the death
,e of G. A. l;ondran. He reached
d the city early Monday and was
e joined at the Cosmopolitan Hotel

g C. S. E. Babington, Dewitt
Branch, Dr. Bruck and Delos R.
Johnson, all of Franklinton; Sen
ator J. S. Settoon, of Livingston.
and later Shelby Taylor, of
- Crowley, president of the state
railroad commission, became a
I mehiber of the party.
Former Gov. Sanders and
others had an interview with
Governor-Elect Pleasant and the
whole matter is said to have been
I considered carefully.
The death of Mr. Gondran
brought to early consideration
the matter of assistants in the
attorney general's office, which
would not have came up under c
natural order until the inaugura. t
tion of Judge A. V. Coco, who
will succeed Col. Pleasant on
May 1. 4. R. Mitchell of Lake
Charles has ben, iQaggg upon as
one of the strong entrants for a
place in the office, and he is said
to bave had good backing, both
personally 4nd politically. James
W. Gardner, nephew of Judge
Coco, whose support in the pri
mary has been frequently men.
tioned, was predited with sup.
porting Mitchell for one of the
assistants. Harry P. Gamble and
W. M. Barrow, according to gos
sip, were slated for retention,
Mr. Barrow having charge of the
railroad commission business &t
Baton Rouge.
Entry of the Sixth district
claim for the Gondrau vacancy
put a new phase on the situation.
Mr. Carter is said to have been a
strong prop in the Washingtoz
Parish campaign for Pleasant,-
The Daily States.

The Franklinton School. B

ting 30 chicks from 30 eggs. 1
Another member hatchebl off 25 1

done club work before, are famil
iar with the work done by boys
in thie comninnity for the past
few years.
The corn club boys have their
land well prepared, with disc and
section harrows, and I have never
seen any land better preprred by
farmers than these little fellows
have their acres. One member
raised 86 bushels and was award.
ed a scholarship at the L. S. U.
winter short course. He will try
to pass the 100 bushel mark this
year. This boy selected his seed
corn from the field when he be.
gun the club work, and has
found a ready sale for all the
corn he could spare at $2.50 per
bushel.
