We Chalenge the World.
Therare a (treat deal said a
bout tile Colony people, of being
an ignorant set of people. And
they assign their reasons on Jhe
grounds that they work bard all
j the time, and turn their wages
in to Rev. L. S. Garrett's bands.
And be lays it up and lives fat ov
er it. It is true, the people work
hard, and all rw time, in order
to make an honest living. But
it is also a fact that thev do nob
! give their wages to Garrett, to
live fat over it, and to lay it up
in a 08?. it takes every penny
tbey make for the Colony to live
on, and to pay dribes on the
depts that was made by 17 fam
ilies coming; in on them four
years ago, and iiving off of them
all winter and then leaving them,
the empty sack to hold.
They.are trying to live by the
Bible,. as recorded in this lan
guage. "And the multitude of them
that believed were of one heart
and of one soul, neither said any
of them that ought of the things
which he possessed was bisiown;
but they had all things common
Acts 4-32.)
And as far as intelligence
goes we will back them against
the world, and.tbe same on hard
work, the same on honesty, the
same on kindness, and tbe same
on visiting the sick, the poor
and the needy, and in taking
care of the dead.
Hoping that our Readers wiH
see such a livinc as this tho
tbe world wiU take advantage of
