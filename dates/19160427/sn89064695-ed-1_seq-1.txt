FOR UNITED STATES
SENATOR, MOSES E,
CLAPP,
More or less criticism of Sen
ator Clapp has been heard because
of his opposition to exporting war
material to nations that are at war
across the "Great Salt Waters",
but in our humble opinion he is
right, at least from a humanitarian
standpoint.
On the floor of the United States
Senate on January 27th last Sen
ator Clapp made this statement
relative to a pethion that was pre
sented b.y Senator Xeuyon agains'
the transportation of arms to the
countries engaged in war:
"Mr. President, at a later period
I expect to speak at some length
upon the subject. I merely wish
to say at this time that I believe
sooner or laier the awakening con
science of our Christian Nation
will sweep aside the sophistries
that have been invoked to support
the inconsistent and incongruous
spectacle of loading one ship with
food and clothing for widows and
orphans and loading another ship
with the instrumentalities with
which to make more widows and
orphans."
Senator Clapp is right in his
belief that no exportations of arms
should be made to make more
widows and orphans. Besides
this, the senator is thoroughly fair
and he no doubt is against the ap
parent policy of the United States
of favoring the allies as against
Germany.
We do not assume to speak the
sentiments of Senator Clapp by
saying that he is pro-German, but
we at least believe that if he is
not, he believes in fair play.
The Bfackfeet Compro-
mise.
TheBlackfeet Indians that have
been represented at Washington
by two parate delegations will
sell their surplus land. This
agreement was decided upon lat
week by the representatives at
Washitgton of both factions on
the Blackfeet reservation.
The representatives of both fac
tions worked earnestly for their
respective contentions and finally
reached an understanding which
will be of great benefit to the
tribe.
Attempt To Take Away
Celebration Grounds.
LET THE CHIPPEWAS DECIDE.
Nv itwithstanding the overwhelm
ing defeat, at the recent election,
of those who want to bond this
village to its utmost limit for the
purpose of building additional
school buildings, they have suc
ceeded in inducing Congressman
Steenerson to introduce a bill to
give the celebration grounds ad
joining the townsite of White
Earth, to the state for a price that
will be appraised. The bill is as
follows:
"A BILL
To authorize the Secretary of the
Interior to issue a patent in fee
simple to the district school board
number one hundred and twelve,
of White Earth Village, Becker
County, Minnesota, for a certain
tract of land upon payment there
for to the United States in trust
for the Chippewa Indians of Min
nesota.
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Con
gress assembled, That the Secre
tary of the Interior be, and he is
hereby, autnorized to issue to the
district school board numbered
one hundred and twelve, of Whi.e
Earth Village, Becker County,
Minnesota, a patent in fee simple
for the east half of the southeast
quarter of the southeast quarter of
section twenty two, in township
one hundred and forty-two north,
range forty-one west, of the fifth
principal meridian, in the Stnte of
Minnesota, or such part thereof as
the said district school board may
select upon payment by them to
the United States in trust for the
Chippewa Indians of Minnesota of
the appraised value of said land."
In opposition to the above bill
the Chippewa delegates now at
Washington filed the following
letter with the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs which explains its
purport:
"Washington, D.
April 19, 1916.
Honorable Commissioner
of Indian Affairs,
Present.
DKAR SIR:
There is now pending before
Congress H. R. 14533, entitled
"To authorize the Secretary of
the Interior to issue a patent in
fee simple to the District School
Board numbered One hundred and
Twelve, of WThite
Earth Village,
Becker County, Minnesota, for a
certain tract of land upon pay
ment therefor to the United States
in Trust for the Chippewa Indians
of Minnesot." This bill proposes
co -give to the public schools of
Minnesota a part of the White
Earth Agency reservation, des
cribed as follows:
The East half of the Southeast
quarter of SectioD Twenty-two, in
Township One hundred and Forty
two North, Range Forty-one
West, upon an appraised value.
In justice to the Indians upon
White Earth Reservation, who
use the tract in question for vari
ous purposes, including the annual
celebrat on on June 14th, the mat
ter should first be submitted to
them for their assent before the
bill is passed.
If by an act of Congress it is
the intention to break up the
Agency Reservation, or to confis
cate it, it would no doubt be more
satisfactory to the White Earth
Chippewas if the land was made a
part of the townsite of White
Earth and thus permit competitive
tji. t rf .T
THE TOMAHAWK
bids to be made for the land, and
I to sell it by lots.
But in any e\ent, we ask that
i the bill be submitted for the as
sent bf Chippewas at White Earth
before it is acted upon by Con
gress.
If the land in question is not
needed lor a part of the Agency
Reservation, then it should be al
lotted to Indians who have not yet
received allotments who are en
titled to them under the Act of
January 14, 1889, commonly called
the Nelson Act.
Respectfully ycurs,
Gus H. Beaulieu
William Madison
Chippewa Delegates.
In order that Mr. Steenerson
might also learn the sentiment
which exists here as declared by
the recent vote of the residents of
this town, the following letter
was written to him by the Chippe
wa representatives:
"Washington, D.
April 19, 1916.
Hon. Halvor Steenerson,
House of Representatives,
Present.
DEAR SIR:
We enclose herewith a copy of
a letter which we have addressed
to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, and which explains itself
as being against the proposition
of H. R. 14533, introduced in Con
gress by you.
Truth before Favor."
We are acquainted with the
sentiment at White Earth against
the provisions of the bill, and if
you wish to serve the members of
the town of White Eart&*nd the
Indians on the White" Eflfrth BeS-'
ervation generally, in a fair and
impartial manner, you would not
be opposed to the request made in
the letter to the Commissioner.
The questions involved in the
bill have in substance been voted
upon by the residents of the vil
lage of White Earth and were
overwhelmingly defeated very
recently, but now the promoters
of the scheme call upon you to aid
them in a manner fair and honest
men would not do that is, the
villagers would not stand to have
bonds issued for the building of a
public school while so much of the
Chippewa tribal fund is being used
for educational purposes and ample
school facilities exist at White
Earth, and now what they voted
against you are asked to push
through Congress regardless of
their wishes in favor of the small
number whose leaders are suspect
ed of having ulterior motives in
the proposition, and who were
never known to be sufficiently
public spirited to make any sacri
fices.
Yours truly,
Wm. Madison.
Gus H. Beaulieu."
Words are not minced any in
the criticism of those who are the
real leaders of the proposed build
ing of a school, in the letter to
Mr. Steenerson, and it is now up
to him whether he wishes to sup
port their contentions, or he is
willing to let the Indians, who
own the lands, decide whether
the celebration and ball grounds
will be sold to the state upon an
appraised value, or whether they
will continue to be kept intact as a
part of the Agency Reservation,
or whether they will be made as a
part of the Townsite of White
Earth and sold as lots to the high
est bidders.
The delegates at Washington
are not assuming any responsibil
ity by asking that the Chippewas
be allowed to express their senti
ment by vote with regard to the
Steenerson bill, and it would be
only making a concession to them
to which they arc entitled.
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, April 27, I9I6.
THE PILLAGER CLAIM.
Congressman C. B. Miller, of
Duluth, has introduced in Con
gress a bill which provides that
the claim of the Pillager Chippe
was for the tract of lane they
ceded conditionally, shall be re
ferred to the Court of Claims for
adjudication.
The tract referred to is common
ly called by the Chippewas the
Long Prairie cession, and if Hole
m-the day had not been assassinated
in 1868, when he was oa the point
of*starting for Washington, there
is no doubt the tract would have
been given to the Chippewas as a
reservation, which was the obj
of his proposed trip to Washing
ton. Unfortunately the day be
fore he intended to start with the
late Charles H. Beaulieu and Rog
er Aitken. he was shot in araoush
by some Pillager Chippewas.
Congressman .Miller has taken
the matter in hand to give the
Pillagers an opportunity to pre
sent their claim to the Court of
Claims, and it is hoped by the In
dians interested that the bill will
be passed before the expiration of
this Congress.
Van Metre Starts For
Washington.
John T. Van Metre, the Mahno
men attorney, recently left for
Wi&hington, D. for ther -puf
"pose of urging the passage ot ft
bill to give the State Courts of
I Come in and look
over our line of
White Earth,
iWiSutfc**!
Minnesota jurisdiction over in
herited Indian lands.
It soem* unnecessary that such
legislation as Mr. Van Metre pro
poses to urge is required to settle
conditions here since it could be
done as expeditiously by the issu
ance of fee patents to the heirs of
deceased allottees.
As a matter of fact the proposed
legislation is not in the interest
of the heirs of allottees, but decid-
edljT
against them, and the Chip-
pewa delegates now at Washing
ton should be instructed to op
pose the Van Metre bill.
The experience of some of the
most intelligent members of this
reservation iu the past shows that
unless they have funds to fight
law suits land sharks will beat the
more ignorant ones out of the in
herited allotments they hold if
jurisdiction over them is given to
the state courts.
CHIPPEWAS MAY HAVE
ATTORNEYS.
Congressman Ellsworth on the
17th of this month introiuccd a bill
in Congress to provide for the em
ployment of attorneys. This was
done at the request of the two
Chippewa delegates now at Wash
ington who believe the Indians
should select the attorneys in a
general council and in opposition
to a handful of the Otter Tail
band at Pine Point who are mak
ing efforts to secure the employ
ment of O. DanWs:
