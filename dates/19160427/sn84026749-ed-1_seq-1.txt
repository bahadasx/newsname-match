COLUMBUS, N. M., April 27.
, Four Mexican prisoners at Casab
Grandes are reported today to
have been killed by United States
sentries on attempting to escape.
Scores of Villistas captured are
said to be held at various points
along the American . communica
tion lines. Much valuable infor
mation has been obtained from
them.
Two Mexicans wounded in an
attack on a supply train near
Satevo recently were captured, ac
cording to motor truck guards who
arrived today. ,
Twenty Mexicans ambushed the
train at night. The guards sought
cover behind the steel wheels of
their truck and. beat off the snip

Col. Dodd Closing In
On Bandits, Fight Near
Bli PASO, Tex., April !7. Another
battle with the Villistas defeated by
Colonel Dodd on Saturday was expected
sourly today.
After a brief" halt at Mlnaca to pro
cure supplies and fresh horses the vic
torious American detachment is report.
ed to have resumed the chase.
With Dodd closing in on the west, the
bandltr are believed to be hemmed in
by other American forces at Providen
oia and Ban Antonio, across the moun
tains. Tho Villistas were making for the ln-
accesuDie mountain country cast of Ml
naca at last reDorts.
While official reports made no men
tlon of Villa's whecrabouts, Aviator
Willis, who passed through here to fort
8am Houston to be treated for Injuries,
expressed the belief that Villa was In
the section between Mlnaca and Batevo.
Most of the expeditionary forces are
concentrated at the Naminulpa and
Dublan base camps today, but a picked
force of several hundred cavalrymen Is
far below Namlqulpa. keeping up tho
search for the bandit leader.
That the United mates must name a
date for the withdrawal of the expedi
tion irrespective of tho outcome of tho
hunt for Villa Is understood to be one
of the demands General Obregon con
templates making at the coming border
conference with General Bcott. Among
other demands Obrcgon will make, ac
cording to Mexican authorities, are:
The United States must agree not to
seize any Mexican railroad.
The United States must not send any
additional troops Into Mexico.
Breach Might Affect
. Pershing's Expedition
Insistent reports of a break between
Carranza and Obregon interested Ad
ministration officials today, because of
the bearing such a split might have on
the present American punitive expedi
tion in Mexico.
Obreron is hastening north from Mex
ico City for a bordor confercnce""-wlth
General Scott, chief of staff, and Gen
eral Funston, commanding the Ameri
can' expedition against Villa.
Carranza is reported In dispatches to
ds' as being en route to Vera Cruz.
ri'heso reports say that Carranza Is in
.tight. This is not entirely credited
here, hut, nevertheless, his departure
from the Mexican capital at this time
would seem to reauire explanation.
When Obrcgon started for tho border
to hold nis conierences witn acoit ana
Funston It was reported from Moxlcan
sources that a split had occurred be
tween Carranza and Obrecon.
Keporta of a circumstantial character

Obreen, who was Carranza's chief mil
itary leader in tno successful revolution

Significance was seen in the concentra
tion of a forco of 40,000 Mexican troops
In northern Durango and Chihuahua at
the time when Obregon and the Ameri
can flimy enters were going inio. con
ference. Administration officials today would
not admit that there had been any offi
cial reports bearing out the rumors' of
a break between Carranza and Obregon
that might mean the beginning of a new
revolution. It la likely that reports
from diplomatic and consular sources
in Mexico within the next day or so will
throw light on these reports.

Crisis Now Is Passed
In Submarine Issue
BERLIN .(via Amsterdam),
April 27. The crisis in the
German-American situation
growing out of the subma
rine controversy has virtu
ally passed.
There will be no rupture of
diplomatic 'relations predi
cated on any deevlopments
to date.
This statement is made today
on excellent authority.
Pending negotiations for a
more complete understand
ing, German submarine com
manders will be under cer
tain explicit instructions
from the admiralty.
What these instructions will be
is riot known. They will be
of such a nature, however,
as to furnish assurance that
there wil be no repetition ot
the acts complained of by
the United States while ne
gotiations are in progress.
The high point of danger is
said to have been reached
and passed two days ago
when the foreign office re

Appeal For Miss Mazyrak
CHICAGO, April tl. Chicago mem
bers of the National Bohemian Alliance,
aided by Miss Jane Addams and other
Hull house workers, today planed to
urge a State Department Inquiry Into
the reported execution of Miss Alice
Matyrak, in Austria as a spy.
Miss Nasyrak, former Chicago settle

professor at the University of Prague,
Bohemia, who had agitated democracy.
State Department Unable
To Aid Miss Mazyrak
The State Department was without,
word today confirming the report that'
Alice Masyralr, once of Chicago, had
been executed In, .Austria. The de

execution. j

that of Edith Cavell, Irr which the
United Btatea Government acted vigor

Neither woman possessed American citi
