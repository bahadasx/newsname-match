There is a clamor in this section for a
Sunday school, and since the future bet­
terment of our county and commnnity
depends, largely, upon the training of
the children, we predict one will be or­
ganized.
Peter Linnell has purchased several
head of cattle to nip the grass from the
pasture of his homestead. He has his
eyes open to a business many others are
planning, and we feel safe to say in a
few years there will be a number of
herds of cattle on the Reservation.
We are delighted with the daily mail
service to Hovland, but we feel very
bine because it was not extended to
Grand Portage. There are forty settlers
and as many Indians on the Res., and
somewhere in the neighborhood of a
dozen mail boxes. We feel we have not
been given due consideration, but con­
tent ourselves in the hope that with the
completion of the Portage road the ser­
vice will be put through daily to the ter­
minus.
The Reservation does not resemble

celestial abode, we are told, they neither
marry nor are given in marraige while
in this place they fairly tumble over
each other in their eagerness to put their

ly, due to leap year. Three couples
were married within a week leaving
their loving hearts imputed on Cupid's
cloth yard shafts, two by two as the
animals went into Noah's Ark. The
Foster Linnell-Reath Smith wedding
was the first to take place followed
within a week by a double wedding—
Carl Linnell-Inez McGath and Lester
Smith-Mildred Linnell. May their
pathway through life be strewn with
lilies and crowned ^rith roses. A wed
ding ball was given in honor of the Foe
ter Linuell-timith wedding at the bome
of the groom's father, Peter Linnell.
The charivari was omitted due to the
