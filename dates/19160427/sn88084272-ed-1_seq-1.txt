Unallfac(ory Announcement.
While the text is brief and gives no
Insight into the reason for Issuing the
decree, mining men here say they have
heard through semi-official Mexican
channels that Cabrera intends to
finance the de facto government's new
600,000,000 peso currency Issue in this
manner, lie will offer the currency to
the mining companies, at a rate not
yet specified for their bullion. It Is
Indicated by raining men that such
an exchange would be highly unsatis
factory to the mine operators.
Several mining properties sooth of
Douglas will be affected by the decree,
but chiefly the Kl Tigre company
whose properties lie 78 miles southeast.
But one chance to evade the decree is
Been by local raining men. This will
be for mining companies to cease mul
ing their concentrates Into bars, send
ing the concentrates to this country
instead. This would greatly Increase
the tonnage exported and, therefore,
the cost of operation.
Decree Cancelled.

to Settle Disputes.
London, Eng., April 27. The contents
ot the British note, replying to the
protest of the American goTaroment
against inferences with neutral trade,
which asserts the right of Great
Britain to regulate the admission to a
neutral country of goods evidently des
tined for the. enemy, caused little sur
prise in diplomatic and legal circles, as
its conclusions had been discounted by
recent decisions of the prize tribunals.
A summary of the views of the mem
bers of these circles may be expressed
as follows:
"They do not believe the controversy
will be carried much further daring the
progress of the war as no vital conces
sions have been made by either side
since the first note was written. There
fore the shippers of detained cargoes
who can afford the delay will await
the conclusion of the war to have their
cases settled by an international tribu
nal in a belief that such a court will
soon send two notes to Great Britain
one on the detentions of the mails and
other on the removal of Austrlans and
Germans from the steamship China."

THE WEEK-END HERALD this week will feature an excellently written
story on the discovery, rise ami fall of the mining camp of McMillan.
Arizona, near the present site of Globe. It h a thrilling story, written
by Dan Itose, one of the pioneer mining men of Arizona, who lived in those
days and knew personally the men who made McMillan.
His graphic story of the raid by Indians upon the town, of its lucky
discovery by a man who was too drunk to ride further: ot the duels and
the "high grading," of life generally in the early camp typical of scores of
others that marked that period in the life of the Great Southwest is full of
interest. Don't fail to get your Week-End Herald and read it.
McMillan is but a memory today, its location covered in weeds and brush
that have grown up over the once thr i ingitown, but during its life it was
one of the livest places on the globe. Mr. Rose's recollections are interesting
indeed.
