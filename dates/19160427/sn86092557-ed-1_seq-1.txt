JJncoln district will add to Mnrion
county CO miles of good roads which
will be the pride of the citizens of
that section when they are completed.
Lincoln district is peculiarly needful
of ; good roads, as all churches and
school houses in that section are loca
ted on the main roads and accessible
from all sections of the district.
Mt is the belief of the host posted
citizens that the construction of new
"ads will work wonders in the dis
trict. not only in the matter of im
proving the transportation facilities,
but in increasing the value of the real
estate. This applios especially to the
arm land. Some of the most earnest
aUvocates of the new improvements
are.owners of farms who expect that
the increase in valuations will more
than offset the taxes that will hav^
tdibe raised to meet the interest
charges and sinking fund.
The boud issue calls for 5050.000
for road improvement. The improve
ments contemplated will join the Fair
mont and Manninton districts which
are already well supplied with good
; roads.
v ; Lincoln district citizens have Wet
zel county on one side and Harrison
county on the other and when they
have complted tholr highway improve
ments, it will be possible to pass from
Harrison county through Marion to
?Wetzel on the finest span of ro.Ms in
the state.
Ttfext Monday in the county court
room of the Marion county court house
? the, canvassing board will meet and
: ?Jetermine the procedure to follow in
the construction of the Rood roads.
? This meeting has to be hold five days
after the elections
