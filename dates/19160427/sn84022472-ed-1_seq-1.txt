The mew map calls, for four police
men ' to be stationed in Remington

section ibounded on the west by Mill
Hill avenue and on the east by
Bruce's brook. Barnum avenue will
be tihe southern boundary line and
Success . Hill will ', be . the northern

This is the neighborhood, -that only

about the limbs of trees, the crack of
the hunter's rifle and the noise of a
discharge of gunshot could be heard

Cops will pull the strings to land
these "beats" in the "summer time
where they may enjoy the balmy

. The most embarrassing embargo yet
placed upon freight shipments to this
city will go into effect at midnight.
The embargo absolutely prohibits
all- car shipments of both anthracite
and bituminous coal. The lumber
and cement shipments to this city will
be cut down to one-third of the daily
amount offered at terminal points for
delivery to this city and with the
exception of . foodstuffs for human
consumption. printing paper and
household goods no shipments of less
than carload lots are to ibe deliver
ed. . '
. This condition led to strong com
ment this morning in "circles . where
the prospective embargo was known.
The only excuse offered by railroad of
ficials for the act, which throws ship
ments of nearly all goods purchased
in New York or elsewhere about the
country for delivery to retail merch
ants in this city, into the hands of
express companies at high transporta
tion rates or to the 'boat-lines that are
already runninig tor capacity, is the fact
that freight handlers are scarce
throughout New England, having
been attracted to other work by a ,
higher scale of wage.
' The effect of this embargo is that
small freight shipments bought in cit
ies along the line of the New Haven
road will. he 'handled. ' Goods in less
than carload lots and not for human
consumption, . bought by clothiers,
hardware dealers and the host of re
tail merchants in this city will be
handled 'by the New Haven railroad
if shipped through the express com
pany, which heretofore seemed to
have no difficulty in getting handlers
for express matter, or will have to
take their chance through the boat
lines from New York. -asked
for an explanation of the condi
tions here, said: "It means that fac
tories here dependent upon their coal
supply from the New Haven road will
not get any exceptwnat is already pn
the way. All coal shipped into New
England will be delivered. No new
shipments will be received. I do not
know how long the embargo' will last.
"So far as Bridgeport is concerned
there is no. reason for the embargo.
We are handling what is coming in
with reasonable regularity. The embargo,-as
I-understand it, is in part
due to the labor troubles Men Bra
not abundant. ' At all large centers
there is the same trouble of getting
help." . ,
