(By Associated Press.)
Washington, April 26.-Au official
declaration or the t'nited States to
ward armed merchant shipa. juade
juilhllc hy Secretary Lansing today,
reiterates tho purpose of the Ameri
can government to recognize the
rigni of merctantmenV to carry arms
for defense. The declaration also
sets forth tjie conditions under which,
tlie United States submarines may
attack a merchant craft.
The right.of armed merchantmen,
without losing it's peaceful character,
?to protoct itself either by flight or
hy resistance ls insisted upon. Again,
while an attacking ship may use
torco against a resisting ' merchaut
?hip, the attack is to cease bs'soon
as tho merchantmens resistance
stops. Only when it is impossible

such cases persons aboard mUst be

The right to'^nk a n'outrai mer?

case. It contradicts Germany's con
tention that merchantmen miist wait
to ho fired upon 'before lt is actually
attacked.

INNES ONLY KNEW THE
NELMS WOMAN AS HER
LAWYER IN UTAH STATE
Atlanta, April '2G-Although Ful
ton county, through appointment by
Judge Ben H. Kill of Fulton superior
court, has furnished Victor K. Innes
and his wife two of the ablest lawyers
in tlie state of Georgia to defend them
In their trial on charges of larceny ?f
ter trust lu connection with the mys
terious disappearance of tho Keiths
slstora, the county will not appropri
ate money to bring evidenco from Tex
as or Oregon for the purposu of es
tablishing an allhl for the defendants.
Appreciating the fact that they will
in a sense, be accused of the murder
of Beatrice and Eloise Nelms, though
nominally on trinl for in^^ny aft*?*
trust. Innes and his Arlie have plan
ned .to .riiake tho defense that Innes
knew Eloice Nelms only aa her law
yer In the state of Utah while secur
ing her divorce from her husband, and
that he1 had absolutely no dealings
with her after the divorce verdict was
obtained.. '.
J In order to support'this contention,
ft, was the-plan, it is Stated, of Innes
to'deny that either 'himself or bl? wife
were over In Atlanta previous to their
present sojourn here, abd to deny that
either of them had ever had any com
munication with Eloise ???elms or Be
atrice Nelms, after the divorce suit in
Utah,
To this end, it Is stated. Innes In
tended to attempt to establish cn ali
bi, by showing that he was in Oregon,'
'or Texas, nt the time ho Is accused of
being In Atlanta, and owing to his im
poverished financial condition it/was
necessary for Fulton county to pay
the expense of securing' interrogato
rio?, records, etc., If .such evidence
were to?be-Introduced. . "
Jt was made-known yesterday; how
ever, by the hoard , of county commis
sioners that they w.111 mukp.no appro
