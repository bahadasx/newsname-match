Situation in West Serious;
Sir John Maxwell Given
Plenary Power Over Whole
Country
By Associated Press
London, April 27. 3.20 P. >l.
Martini law has boon declared
throughout all Ireland. Fighting
is .still going on in the streets of
Dublin.
Premier Asquith announced in the
house of commons to-day that the
rebels continue to hold important pub
lic buildings in Dublin and that street
encounters were still in progress.
Premier Asquith told the house the
Irish situation still presented serious
features to-dav and there were indi
cations of n spread of the movement
to other parts of Ireland, especially
in the west.
Sir John Maxwell to Itule
The premier announced thai Ma.ior-
General Sir John Maxwell, -who for
merly commanded the British forces in
Egypt, was leaving London for Ire
land. The general has been given
plenary powe«rs, under martial law,
oxer the whole country.
The premier said there would be a
searching investigation into the cause
of and responsiliility for the outbreak.
Tic added thai it was obviously neces
sary to exercise military censorship
while martial law prevailed in Ireland.
This censorship, however, would be
directed more with regard to the es
sential military requirements of the
silnation. All possible latitude in the
transmission of news would be allowed,
l eaders Wltli Government
Sir Edward Carson and John Red
mond. who were the leaders of llie
opposing factions in the Irish home
rule controversy, expressed in the
house of commons their abhorrence of
the uprising and their desire to sup
port the government.
£ Sending More Troops
▼ The troops in Ireland have been
and are being strongly reinforced, Mr.
Asquith added, and the government
was satisfied the force dispatched was
adequate to deal with the situation.
The Trish authorities will place
themselves at the disposal of Major
General Maxwell to carry out his in
stt uctions.
Proclamation of martial law
throughout Ireland may indicate an
extension of disturbances, details of
Which the rigid British censorship is
withholding. Cable dispatches yes
terday and early to-day give the im
pression that the British authorities
lin< the situation in Ireland well in
hand. Martial law, it was said, had
been declared only in the city and
county of Dublin. A few minor dis
turbances outside Dublin were re
ported. but they were described as of
small importance.

FEELING AGAINST

Situation of Yankees in Du

Peons Rebellious
WILL CONFER TOMORROW
Generals Seott, Funs ton and
Obregon to Meet Soon; Turk
men Ambushed
El Paso, Texas, April 27. Dis
turbing reports were received here
to-day from many points in Northern
and Central Mexico regarding anti-
American feeling on the part of the
peons.
The most serious of these reports
referred to towns in Durango and
especially to Durango City where the
Americans are still living there have
been repeatedly warned by United
States Consul Coen to leave. As far
as can be learned here there are not
more than a dozen Americans still in
Durango City, the majority of them
have married Into Mexican families
and for that reason have so far con
sidered themselves safe.
The present trouble seems to be duo
in part to the persistent anti-American
campaign which has been carried on
by the Mexican papers in the State
Capital. This campaign had in
creased in violence since the clash at
Parral between United States soldiers
and Carranza troops.
Americans who have arrived here
from Durango and Southern Chi
huahua say that the Parral incident
has been magnified out of all propor
tions and grossly distorted by Mex
ican papers which have described it
as a great Mexican victory.
Columbus, N. M., April 27.—Truck
men arriving here to-day told of being
ambushed by a roving band of
marauders of about 150 attached to
no Mexican faction, in a canyon near
Satevo several days ago. The truck
men and their soldier guard took a
position behind the steel wheels of the
cars and returned the fire, routing
