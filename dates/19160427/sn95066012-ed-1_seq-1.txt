ROOSEVELT WOULD FIGHT
Colonel's Sons Would Also Be Found
in the Ranks.
Jester Bay, L. I., April 26. Colo
iiv. ?dore Roosevlt gave out a
staten. . , tvnday night In which he
held I'resiu .tison and his advis
ers guilty of a against the na
tion" in failing to pi ...We the country
against the emergency of war with
Germany or ar.v other world power.
The Colonel said:
Men are saying that they stand be
hind the President or by the Presi
dent. 1 wish to speak for the men
who in the event of war will stand In
front of the President and between
him and the foreign enemy; and who,
therefore, will stand between danger
and the men who are behind or beside
the President.
These are the men who will go to
the war at once if there is war with
Germany, or with any other great
power, and who feel, as I do, that we
would far rather go to war unprepared
than see our women and children mur
dered with impunity and the honor of
the flag stained.
But it is a wicked thing that tho
folly of our rulers, in obeying the be
hests of tho peace-at-any-price people
and of the apostles of anti-preparedness,
should make the sacrifice either
useless or else needlessly and appall
ingly wasteful in blood.
In the event of such a war my four
sons will go, and one, and perhaps
both, of my sons-in-law ; I will go
myself; the young kinsfolk and friends
of my sons will go; so my words are
spoken with my eyes open.
!t is of small consequence what hap
pens to us of the older generation; but
when I think of the young men my
heart grows bitter that their fine and
gallant young lives should be sacri
ficed, not to the nation's need but to
the nation's folly.
I would far rattier see them dead
than see them flinch from their duty
when the honor of our people is con
cerned. But If we now go to war these
young men and all their fellows will
die in thousands of fever and dysen
tery and lung trouble in the camps,
because we have not prepared in ad
vance, because they and those who
would lead and care for them have not
been trained in advance.
They will be butchered needlessly in
battle because we have failed to pre
paie masses of artillery and machine
guns and motor trucks, and shells and
aeroplanes, and have failed to provide
and train the men who shall manage
all the formidable and delicate mech
anism of war.
Twenty-one months have passed
Bince the great war began, and durine
all this time we have not prepared in
even the smallest degree In order, if
possible, to avert war from us; or, if
it would not be averted to wage it
efficiently and successfully.
The pacifists and anti-preparedness
people have had their will and our
rulers at Washington have bowed to
them and left us helpless, and with
blind fatuity they said they did this
in the Interests of peace.
When will our people learn that the
peace of un preparedness Is the peace
of cowardice and folly, and may at
any time lead to overwhelming dis
aster?
Fourteen months ago we notified
Germany that if she did whatever
since she has done and continued to
do, we would hold her to a strict ac
countability. ' Such language could on
ly oe just mod if immediately and in
thorough-going fashion we had boat
our every energy to the task of prt
paring and therefore showing that we
meant what we said and that we as-
sessed both the will and the power to
make our words good.
Such a course would not have In
creased, It would have greatly di
nilnished, the chances of war. But we
sat supine. We took not one step to
prepare. Naturally Germany did not
treat us seriously; we misled her.
New, fourteen months afterward
we say that we were serious. If Ger
many now does as we wish, it will, as
I have said before, he proof positive
that Germany would have promptly
yielded If fourteen months ago we had
so acted that Germany knew we meant
what we said, and in such case, there
fore, our rulers at Washington will
have been proved responsible for the
blood of the thousands of peaceful
men, women, and children who have
been killed.
If she does not yield, we are then
faced with a crisis for which, during
twenty-one months, wo have failed to
prepare in even tho smallest degree
'The failure of our rulers at Wash
Ington to prepare during these twon
ty-one months, when even a child
ought to have seen what was im
pending, has represented a folly so ex
treme that in its effort It was a crime
against the nation.

London,' April 27. All Ireland has
been placed under martial law,' Pre
mier Asquith told the house of com
mons today.
London, Apri: 26. Drastic steps
have been taken by the British gov-
rnment to suppress the rising in
Dublin by the proclamation or mar
tial law in the city and county and
by proclaiming the associations which
took part in the movement illegal as
sociations which will enable the po
lice to break them up.
This was announced in the House
of Commons today by Premier
Asquith, who, while making a more
reassuring statement with regard to
the situation in the Irish capital, did
not add much to previous knowledge
of what has happened there since noon
cf Monday, when rebels took posses
sion of the postoffice and other sec
tions of the city.
The Prime Minister was able to
say, however, that Liberty Hall, the
headquarters of t he Sinn Fein party.
and St. Stephen's Green, which
seemed to have been the center of
the rising, had been reoccupied by
the military, who were being rein
forced by troops from England and
Belfast.
The men connected with the filibus
tering expedition now in the hands of
the Government include Sir Roger
Casement, two Irish confederates and
22 Germans comprising the crew. Tho
chief Importance of the capture lies
In the revelations made of an exten
sive plot having ramifications in Ger
many, Ireland and America. Irish-
mericans are said to have been large-
y instrumental In financing the revo
lutionary movement.
The expedition consisted merely of
submarine and a 1100-ton steamer,
which approach the coast at different
points. Casement and his companions
landed in a rowboat from the sub
marine.

UNIQUE PROGRAM
Special Musical Features in "Old
Vermont."
A most unique program of old time
music and dances will be included in
the play "In Old Vermont" which will
be given next Tuesday evening in Li
brary hall by tho Festival Committee
of the Public Welfare Association. Sev
eral of those to be given have been
handed down orally from pre Revolu
tionary days In old Bennington County
families:.
The song "New England" was sung
from memory by a member ot one of
Bennington's old families, and so writ
ten down and harmonized by Prof.
Richard Bahan. "Ho all to the Bor
ders" was Ethan Allen's favorite poem
and came down verbally in an old Ar
lington family. The story of the Bat
tle of Bennington is to be told by a par
ticipant and does not sound a bit like
the conventional historial accounts.
The children are called upon for an
old English Morris dance. Equanok,
the Indian guest of honor (from whom
Mt. Equinox in Manchester received
its name) shows what his people
were like In an Indian dance and some
of the young folks show the children
what real dancing is like in a minuet
that the school teacher learned down
in Albany.
Although the play is by Dorothy
Canfield Fisher, Bennington has made
a contribution of its own in the song
"A Pledge to Vermont" by Mrs. II. W.
Tirrell. The audience is sure to feel
a thrill when Mr. Bottum sings this
as well ns when Dean Martin leads the
chorus in cheers and an original ver
sion of Yankee doodle when the news
conies from Bennington that the con
vention has voted that Vermont will
join the Union.
The Patronesses may obtain their
tickets at Mulligan & Roche's Friday.
The general sale of reserved seats will
begin Saturday morning at 8 a. m.
and as the capacity of Library ball is
so limited tickets should be obtained
well In advance.
