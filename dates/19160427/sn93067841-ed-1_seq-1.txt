tifully hand embroidered and cro- v
cheted pieces and serviceable linens v
of many and varied descriptions. c
A "bride's booklet" was then passed q
around and each one present regis- v
e" tered and gave a few words of ad- n

HAY DELAY REPLY TO WILSON'S
"ULTIMATUM" UNTIL SUBMARINE
DISPUTE CAN BE SETTLED.
Berlin, April 25:? (Via London.)? ;
American Ambassador Gerard is to
lave another conferene with Dr Von
Jethmann-Hollweg this evening, pri>r
to the imperial chancellor's de)arture
for great headquarters.
At the foreign office the corres- |
indents were informed that the
ihancellor was devoting the holidays j
o conferences on the submarine1
ssuelwith the departments concern- j
:d. These have not yet been con-'
:luded.
The main purpose of the imperial
ihancellor's flying trip to Berlin has
>een, as is evident from his proracted
conference with Ambassador
Gerard on Monday, the desire to obain
as clear an idea as possible of
he attitude and policy of the Ameri:an
Government, what, if anything,
ies behind and beyond the Ameri:an
note, and what measures are
lecessary to satisfy the American
lemand before the momentous decison
is taken by the Emperor and his
idvisers.
The crisis has come to a head in
he midst of the Easter holidays, a
eason playing a highly important
ole in German life, when public
nen are widely scattered from Berin;
and their views, which the Em>eror
would naturally wish to ascer- !
ain before reaching a decision, not
[uickly assembled. Thus the formu- !
ation of a reply to the American J
lote, which presumably would spell !
par or peace, cannot oe rusnea.
So far as Germany is concerned '
here still is a possibility of a settle- 1
[lent, and hope has not been aban- j
oned here. But the Germans apiear
to wish to know before giving
heir answer what sort of answer
pould satisfy the United States,
phether assurances of a properly
onducted submarine would be adeuate
and whether concessions now
pould be the prelude to more delands
later.
It can be stated positively that Dr
fon Bethmann-Hollweg and his adisers
realize fully the disadvantages
f a break with the United States,
nd that they do not desire it if it
an be avoided. But they feel, if a
reak must come ultimately, it would
e useless to indulge in concessions
nd compromises now, and that they
light as well have the matter setled.
During the crisis there has been an

LANSING AND CORRESPONDENTS.
