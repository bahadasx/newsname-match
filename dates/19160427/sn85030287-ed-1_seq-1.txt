New School Buildings ,, ',
' ; '.j-'. -
A number of new school build
ings are to be erected in' various
parts of the county between now
and the beginning of the fajl
term of school. In most instanc
es larger' buildings are needed
to'accommodate the' increasing
enrollmen't.'. All the" buildings
will be modern in most respects
and will be erected according to
plans '.' and specifications for
standard rural school buildings.
The districts making such im
prpvemcnts are: .

south east of Meade, known as

Two teachers will be employed
at Missler, ' six miles west of
Meade, next year, in place of one

number 6f pupils in the district,
making too much work for one
teacher, has made the extra in
structor necessary.

Condition of Gty Streets
' .' s " . .
''(' ' :. . ' '
Editor News:'
It is generally known bow long
I hav lived in Meade, well nigh
on to a third of a '..ceo try, but I
must confess that in all that time
I do-not remember the streets
being in as deplorable condition
as they are right at this time,
and that too; in the face of tbe
fact that more money has been
expended in the past year, we
frhould'think than any'year dur
ing jhat period. T&lk about pleas
ure'riding in our city, well, just
try it once in an auto, and you
will find it bumpty-bump, and
great care must be taken to
avoid accidents.'
; Now, this miserable condition
is due wholly to the manner in
which the strdets have been
worked. Deep ditches have been
plowed. and scraped along either
side aod at each crossing there
is an open ditch all the way from
six inches to a foot or more be
low tbe crossings, and one can
easily imagine how this would
Take the hill just east of tbe
Read corner; beae mucb grading
was done about a month ago,
Deepditcbes have been, plowed
on each side. .Now. what does
ii . . .
cms mean wnen heavy rains
come? .You all can easily imag
ine, tbe loose dirt- will go down
and the ditches will become deep
er and deeper. - Just imagine
ditches being plowed on the hill
side.' In all , truthfulness; and
fairness, in my estimation' this
portion at the street; is in far
worse condition than it wad be
fore all tbat work was . done in
fact, I regard it a positive dam
age on hillside, and the other
streets that have been, "worked"
in my opinion are none tbe better
and practically a useless expen
diture of the people's money.
"It is not my desire to offend
anyone or misrepresent the true
condition of the streets of Meade,
but I do honestly think much of
the work none has been abortive
and a positive hinderance to trav
el, and furthermore, I say tbat
if one-tenth of tbe money had
been spent for dragging that has
been expended for "working"
our streets would be in tip-top
candition, and is it not a fact
that on all level stretches where
there has been no work done that
tbe streets are in best condition?
In conclusion I say dispense with
the plow and the scraper and
hang onto tbe drag. - Drag after
every rain and, drag 'until tbe
surface is level. No use of the
bigb centers and ditches in a dry
country like this. ' " '
And now in conclusion I make
this proposition to all ' who may
be off ended by this communica
tion. ' Come to my office and I
will take pleasure in driving you
over our city and 'showing" you
the streets.
Yours for good, efficient
and economical service, ?
FRANK FUIIR.
N.B. Next week ! will have
something to say about tbe coun
