LOCALS PLAY ALMOST N
PERFECT BALL CAME
Semi-Professionals Get No i

One Hit a
re
Bogalusa fans were given the hi
classiest game of baseball that has st
been played on the local grounds
for several seasons Sunday after- N
noon. and to say that the game re- he
sembled a professional one would et
be an injustice to the members of W
both teams because professionals he
rarely play as good ball as was is
played Sunday. The game was be- P
tween the fast Bogalusa team and w
the Eberhardts, a semi professional C
team of New Orleans. who have k:
played here on previous occasions S
The final score was 1 to 0 in favor
of the locals. That does not begin
to tell the story for the visitors did
not make a hit off of Ivans until
the ninth inning. He was in per
fect form and received almost per
fect support, only one error being k
charged to the Bogalusa team.
Ivans had eleven strike outs to his g
credit while Trenchard, of the Eber
hardts, struck out only 6. The lo
cals made seven hits but all were I
scattered and the only score made
during the game was by Stapleton fi
who walked to first and advanced
to second on Boyds sacrifice and s
then stole third and reached home
on an error.
Underwood, of the locals, made
the sensational play of the game
running with his back to the r
ball caught a hard one in
center field.
Good playing was so common
during the game that the fans be
came so accustomed to the good
playing that they forgat to cheer.

"DR, COLE AND FAMILY LEAVE 1
LOCATE IN NEW ORLEANS
Dr. H. C. Cole, for eight years
Chief Surgeon of the Bogalusa Hos
pital, and who several days ago
severed his connections with that in
stitution, left with his family Satur
day afternoon for New Orleans
where he will be located. The de
parture of Dr. Cole and family from
Bogalusa is probably regretted as
much as the loss of any citizens
since Bogalusa was founded. Be
sides having an office in New Or
leans where he will specialize in
surgical practice he will also be on
the staff at the Touro Infirmory and
Charity hospital. The many friends
of the family wish them success
and happiness in their new location
and hope to have them visit the
Magic City frequently.

Unusual Crowd To City
SOne of the largest crowds that
Ihas visited New Orleans recently
Swas on last Sunday when over 300
i tickets were sold. W&ether the

NO DETAILS Of REFOM 1S
MOVEMENT AT FRANKLINTONi
News of the "Reform Movement"
iu Franklinton appears to be of a
mysterious nature as two telephone ct
calls to that city and inquiry from al
residents of the parish seat who
have visited here this week fails to
shed any light on the matter.
According to press reports in the M
New Orleans paper a meeting was
held and among the matters decid- al
ed upon was the starting of another
weekly paver. It is not believed
here that the "Reform" movement
is a political one because at the he
past election the vote in the city e1
was so overwhelmingly large for ci
Col. Pleasant that Franklinton is E
known as a True Blue Democratic
Stronghold.
