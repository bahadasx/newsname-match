Premanent Street Proposition
$Has Created a Vigorous
' Protest.
GREAT BURDEN THIS YEAR
Citizens Will Ask That the
Improvement Be Deferred
Until Times Are Easier.
The proposition to construct per
manent streets on four of the princi
pal streets of the city, made in a
resolution passed by the Commission
ers , a week ago, has caused much
discussion and the people are prepar
ing to make almost a universal protest.
The streets affected are South Main,
South Virginia, East Seventh and
East Ninth. The estimated cost is
$2.50 a square yard for brick and
ranging down to 1.50 for bitulithic.
The streets to be made of
asphalt, wooden blocks or vitrified
brick. The amount on South Main
would bo something over 10,000 yards
and still more on Virginia. The four
streets would be about 40,000 to 50,
000 yards, making the cost run around
$100,000, or about $10,000 a year for
ton ydars, with interest on deferred
payments. It would be about $4 a
front foot, both sides, on streets as
wide M South M.un.
The Commissioners will give fur
ther consideration to the resolution at
a meeting to be held the middle of
May.

Frankfort, Ky., April 20. The
Kentucky Senate Monday afternoon
failed to impeach County Judge J. E.
Williams, of McCreary county, and
he goes acquitted of the charges pre
ferred against him by the House.
The Senate came within one vote of
finding him guilty on the second arti
cle, charging that he issued a warrant
and caused the arrest and imprison
ment without an affidavit of J. A.
Geary, R. C. Sievcrs, Democratic
county campaign chairman; C. E.
Cain, J. C. Roberts, W. S. Gilreath,
Democratic county election commis
sioner, and W. F. Hinkle, who were
on guard about the County Clerk's
office, where the ballots were kept
the Friday night following the last
November election.
On thut charge twenty-three Sena
tors voted to find him guilty and
twelve not guilty. The nearest they
came to impeachment after that was
on Article 13, charging him with col
lecting the fine of bd Hodge a,nd fail
ing to report it to the Circutt Court;
Articles 18 and 20, charging him with
selecting jurors to be summonsed to
try cases for the purpose of favoring
one side in the cases. The vote on
these articles stood 21 to 14. Articles
5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10 and 19 were dismissed
unanimously, and on the other articles
the vote varied, sometimes a majority

shortly before 6 o'clock. Tho Senate

London, April 26. Except in Lor
raine there has been an entire absenco
of infantry fighting on the Western
front. The big guns however have
continued their rain of shells on op
posing positions at various points. At
La Chapelotte in Lorraine, the Ger
mans launched a heavy infantry at
tack against the French, which was
repulsed- Some of the Germans ob
tained a footing in a portion of the
French salient but later were driven
out with heavy losaes.
Around Hill 304 and in the region
of Esnes and Cumieres, northwest of
Verdun, the bombardment continues
intense. In the Argonne the French
have destroyed with their gunsa Ger
man post and shattered a Gorman
trench over a small front. Consider
able aerial activity by the French air
men in vhich four German machines
were brought down is reported by
Paris.
jOn the Eastern front near Garbun-
ovka the Russians made a heavy at
tack against the Germans, but accord
ing to Berlin, were repulsed with
sanguinary losses. Heavy artillery
engagements are still in progress in
the upper Cordevole and Monte San
Michele zones of the Austro-Ifcilian
front.
Tho British official communication
from Mesopotamia says the British
arc still holding their lines on the
right bank of the Tigris against the
Turks and have somewhat extended
them at one point by driving in the
Turkish pickets.

It was a stirring scene as the Rus
sians lined the decks of the transports
and returned the cheers from the
crowds massed along the shore while
the flotilla of warships and merchant
men in tiie harbor saluted with flags
and salvos booming cannon. A regi

up along the quay as a guard of hon
