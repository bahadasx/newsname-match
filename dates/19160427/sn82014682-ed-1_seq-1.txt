JUDGE STUART IN
Stl CASE HITS
AT "SLAVE LABOR
Jurist Takes Series of Judicial
Wallops at Planters, Agents.
Governor, Territorial Law
and Other Things
WILL SENdIcOPY OF HIS
OPINIONS TO PRESIDENT
Hawaiian Statute Passed to
Protect Island Labor From
Raids of Alaska Packers
: Comes in for Criticism
President Wilson's mail about 12
. days from now will contain a commu
nication from Circuit Judge J. 8. Stu
art In which Judge Stuart designates
Filipino labor In Hawaii as "peon or
a lave" labor.
Further, he "hands It to" the plant-
' era and the labor recruiting agents for
the planters In' vigorous terms.' He
; holds that the agents are more to
blame than the planters
'Further,-he takes a Judicial wallop
at Governor Pinkham, harking back
- to the time when the governor was In
the employ of th Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association in the ' Philip
pines. .
Further, he 'delivers a solar plexus
blow at the territorial law which pro
hibits labor-recruiting in these islands
without a proper license. This law
was passed toy the legislature several
years ago when Alaaka salmon-pack-era
were trying to grab many hundred
laborers . of the territory, sending
agents and a vessel here to get them.
. Taking opportunity, through a deci
sion rendered In Ms court today over
the O. A. Steven case. Judge Stuart
scored the territorial laws regarding
labor In ; these Islands declaring that
"planter must see the a ws are fast
bringing ruin, to the most beautiful
spot on earth, and that If the laws
were put up to the planter for' vote
he would signify his disapproval of
them. ' '
Though submitting to the agreement
made "yesterday between opposing
counsel, whereby Steven, pleading
' guilty to1 four charges, was to-receive
a 1100 fine In one charge, and $1 In
each of the others. Judge Stuart de
clared that he saw no reason why this
should be done. He said he did not
approve of one case more than an
other. He made the fine in each case
a dollar, coats remitted. -
In his decision the Judge entered
fully Into the seriousness of the labor
. question, dwelling upon the fact that
the introduction of "peon" labor has
driven the Hawailans who. once ownr-d
the land out of work. '
The decision follows, in part:
In the above four cases, the parties
filed an agreement that defendant, up
on plea of guilty being entered, shall
be .fined one dollar in each of the
three following cases, C. 6294, C. 6296
'and C. 297, and the court shall remit
the costs in said cases. In the re
maining case, C. 6295, it is agreed that
upon plea of guilty by defendant
he shall be fined one hundred dollars
therein. Of, course these fines are
made subject, to the approval of the
In accordance with, the agreement,
the defendant has withdrawn his plea
of not guilty In each case, and has
filed a plea of guilty in each case, so
that virtually all questions have been
taken away from the court.
' As , to the legality of the law on
whichihe informations are filed, when
the &seu were first brought to me by
order of the first Judge, I refused the
motion of the Territory to bind over
witnesses to appear upon the trial,
and without "deciding the question I
- expressed an unfavorable impression
aa regarda the law under which" the
Informations were filed, and 'asked
that briefs be filed. My attention was
then called to the Craig case, 20 Haw.
483. The opinion, being written by
Chief Justice Robertson, holds these
statutes to be constitutional.
Had the cases now before me gone
to completed trial upon the plea of
not guilty, this court m ould have been
placed In a very trying position. It is
my duty to follow the decisions of the
court of last resort in this territory.
It Is also my. first duty, under my oath
of office, to abide by and support the
Constitution of the United States.
On page 492 the chief Justice says:
"For many years past ' the aacces
alve governments of these V islands
have spent, and the present govern-
. ment is now spending, large sums of.
money for the purpose of attrictlng
hither desirable immigrants of the
laboring and agricultural class. The
. material welfare and progress of this
territory require an adequate supply
. of labor Such supply can be obtained
only from distant countries at heavy
expense to our taxpayers. The immi
grants, being generally impecunious
and sometimes very ignorant, finding
themselves among strangers in a
strange country, are peculiarly sua-
' ceptible to such glittering representa-
' tiens as may be and perhaps often are,
held out by irresponsible labor agents.
The legislature was cognizant of these
conditions, and being so was fully
justified in taking any lawful steps in
its power to protect the community,
the people in it, and our local Indus-
- tries, from the incursions of emigrant

"FREE SUGAR" IS
KNOCKED OUT HOW
President Wilson Signs Bill and
' Law Becomes Effective
Immediately
ISpsciil Eur-Btflltln Cable
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 27.
President Wilson signed the Kltchin
free-sugar repeat bill this morning.
The measure became immediately ef
f ective.
i C. S. ALBERT.
' This is the hill which uncondition
ally repeals the clause in the present
tariff law under which foreign sugars
would be admitted duty free to the
United States after May 1. 1916. The
bill was amended In the senate to make
this free-sugar clause effective on May
1, 1920, but the house refused to ac
cept the amendment and the senate
receded. Therefore, the- present tar
iff on sugar will remain in effect in
definitely, the free-sugar feature ' be
ing knocked out by the Kitchin bill.
Since March 1, 1914, 96-degree test
foreign sugars hare been paying L256
cents a pound duty, and Cuban sug
ars, which enjoy a 20 per cent prefer
ential, have been paying 1.0048 cents.
The duty Is generally referred to as
"a cent a pound" because .of: the fact
that it is the Cuban imports which
principally affect the domestic market
and furnish the basis for foreign cofei

FIRM BIDS LOW
A One -big surprise was sprung at 11
o'clock this morning in the office of
the United States engineer, when Maj.
R. R. Raymond, major of engineers, m
Charge of the local office, opened bids
for dredging that portion of the har
bor ' around and near the quarantine
wharf. , ' ;
The s Standard American Dredging
company,' with headquarters in San
FranclsCo, was the lowest bidder, at
23.9 cents per cubic yard. This com
pany's bid was nearly 30 cents a yard
less . than that of the Hawaiian
Dredging Company, which bid 53 cents
a cubic yard, while the Lord-Young
Engineering Company turned in a bid
of 62 cents, almost 40 cents a yard
more than the San Francisco firm.
The Standard Is a reliable firm'
said Mat. Raymond In commenting cu
the astonishingly low bid It made,
"and has done a great deal of work
for the government including all the
work at Los Angeles I had charge of.
t has performed contracts at Tampa,
Ha., and other work on the Gulf Coast
also work for the Mexican govern
ment"
Maj. Raymond estimates that it wtl
be fully five months before actua.
work on the contract can be started
There is an appropriation of S80KH
for the contract which calls for th
removal of 311,000 cubic yards. Tr t
job will take about a year to com
plete. The contract is in three subdivi
sions, H, which will be dredged first;
I, the section Immediately around the
quarantine wharf, which is to be
moved back out of the way, and G, a
much of which will be dredged as the
funds available will permit

NEAR DEATH NOW
Motorcycle Cop Fred Wright
Operated On; Man Whose
Auto Hit Him Held By Police
Motorcycle Officer Fred Wright
struck by an auto, last night is in
such a precarious condition at the
Queen's Hospital that grave fears for
his life-are held this afternoon.' He
was operated on at 1 o'clock by Dx
W. C. Hobdy. He its. suffered since
last night from a scvei? Injury to the
head and has internal injuries also.
The auto that struck him wa? driven
by John Manoa Silva, colteotor in the
postal service. The collision took
place at King and Maunakea streets.

Why . the board of supervisors has
oeen requested to take part in the con
ferences between the public utilities
commission and the Honolulu Rapid
Transit and Land Company regarding
the proposed new charter for the com
pany, was the question raised today
by Supervisor Ben Hollinger.
"I am not going to favor this new
charter if the rights of the supervisors
as regards the. .control of road and,
street work are to be transferred to
the public utilities commission," Mr.
Hollinger said.
Charles ' R. Forbes,' superintendent
of public works and chairman of the
commission, - pointed . out that when
any pavement laid .down by the city
and county undisturbed by the Rapid
Transit In carrying out its proposed
extensions, it will be required that the
railway, make repairs with a similar
type of pavement
Although nothing definite could be
learned today, a meeting of the utili
ties commission and the 'committee
appointed by the Rapid Transit may
be held tomorrow afternoon to further
consider the proposed new charter.
Work on a tentative draft of the
new charter now is being carried out
by the law firm of Castle & Withing-
ton, attorneys for the Rapid Transit,
and James X- Coke, attorney for the
commission. It is believed that the
preliminary draft will be completed
this week and 'turned over to the pub
lic utilities commission for its con
sideration.
A public meeting to discuss the
charter probably will be held before
the commission finally passes on the
bill.
