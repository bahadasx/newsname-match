WASHINGTON, April 26.—General
instructions for the assistance of Ma
jor General Hugh L. Scott at his forth
coming conference with Carranza's war
minister, General Obregon, were draft
ed by Secretary Baker today after
brief conferences with President Wil
son and with Secretary Lansing of the
state department..
The only official statement as to the
nature of the instructions was the
following, issued by Secretary Baker:
"The Instructions are to discuss a
basis for the most cordial and com
plete co-operation between the Ameri
can and Mexican forces in the attain
ment of thei" common object."
While the immediate object of the
conference is, as stated, a question of
military disposition, to put an end to
bandit operations along the border,
there is no doubt its result will have
a strong influence upon the diplomatic
negotiations between the two govern
ments. Suggestions of the conferees
would receive attention both here and
in Mexico City.
It is considered certain General
Obregon will carry back to Mexico City
on his return a definite impression
that the American troops will remain
in the positions to which General Pun
ston now is shifting them, as a buffer
between the disturbed area of North
era Mexico and the border until the
success of the Carranza forces in pur
suing the bandits removes the danger
of further raids on American towns, it
also is virtually certain that the in
tentions of tlie American forces
police thoroughly all the territory in
the immediate vicinity of their ad
vanced bases will be made clear.
To this extent the conference will
give General Carranza advance notice
of the attitude the United States will
take in replying to his note of April 12
suggesting the withdrawal of forces.
Officials hope however that it* more
immediate result will be to clear away
the misunderstanding and suspicion
with which the movements of Ameri
can troops have been regarded by lo
cal Mexican commanders and pfficiais;
to free supply shipments for the troops
from interference which they have met
heretofore, and perhaps to piake pos
sible real joint operations for the cap
ture of Villa.
While it is not known that the or
ders mention Villa, General Scott may
point out to General Obregon that the
most effective way to obtain early
withdrawal of the American forces
from Mexico would be to-lend all pos
sible aid in the chase for the bandit.
With his elimination, eitfior by Ameri
can or Mexican troops, ,it is believed,
the Washington government would
agree to an immediate retirement of
the expedition across ,the border.
It would be made clear in this con
nection that United States officers
have no doubt of their ability to cap
ture the bandit were it not for their
desire to avoid clashfes with the Mexi
cans BUch as occurred at Parral. The
re-disposition of tlid troops to confine
their operations to a more limited
field since that incident will be cited
as evidence of the good faitli of the
statement.
A renewal of tiie hunt for the ban
dit by American troopers now is in
progress, both official reports from
General Funston and border advices
disclosed. The cavalrymen, despite the i
worn condition of their mounts, are
beating the mountains where Villa ad
herents have been assembling during
the lull in the chase after the Parral;
incide.it. No information as to the
whereabouts of Villa lias been
ceived. The war department gave out
this dispatcli from General Funston: j
"Following lust received from Gen-'
following just received from Gen ,
eral Pershing:

A second dispatch from General
Funston follows:
"Late reports from Colonel Erwin
state that on the twentieth instant

eounered small body of Villistas near
Coeomorachlc and mortally wounded
four. Wounded in Dodd's command
doing well and none expected to die."
Special Agenl Rodgers at Mexico
City telegraphed the state department
today that the Carranza government
bad agreed to remove all restrictions
on exportation of leather and hides ef
fective May 1, but refused any conces
sion from its new mining decree. He
said American mining interests in
Mexico would have to determine
whether they would proceed in the
mining industry in accordance with
the new regulations.
Former export duties will remain in
effect, but those on goat and deer
skins probably will lie reduced.

SUMMARY OF DAY'S WARNEWS
Martial law has been declared
in the city and county of Dublin
as a result of the revolutionary
outbreak in Dublin. The lord lieu
tenant of Ireland reports that the
situation there is satisfactory and
says provincial advices are re as
suring. Several positions taken by
the revolutionists, notably Ste
phens Green, have been recaptured
by government forces and Liberty
hall, headquarters of the Sinn
Fein party, has been seized. North
Lowestoft and Yarmouth were
bombarded by the German cruiser
squadron which attacked the east
ern coast of Enland Tuesday.
Four persons were killed and 12
were wounded in the attack and
considerable material damage was
done. Berlin reports that in this
raid the steamer King Stephen
was sunk and her crew captured
and also that a destroyer and a
scout boat were sunk and a cruis
er set on fire. The Germans suf

Sir Roger Casement were partly tin

was the assertion made here today by
Jeremiah A. O'Leary, director of tiie
United [rlsii societies of this city and
president of the American Truth so-1
ciety. "Sir Roger Casement," said Mr.
O'Leary, "collected some $12,000 dur
hig Ills tour of tlie United States in
1914,".. Mr. O'Leary and other very
prominent irisli-Amerieans here who
favor Irish independence, insisted,

acknowledged that two cruisers

no vessel was sunk. It was the

that the damage was slight. Paris
steps are being taken to suppress
