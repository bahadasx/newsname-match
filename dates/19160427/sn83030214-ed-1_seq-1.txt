State Department to-day giving thi* .
country'* viewi on the armed ghip
question further complicated the con- I
trorersy with (iermany.
Officials made no other enplanation
thaa that it was "a matter of general .
interest to the pub'ie." but the unof
f.cial opinion expresaed waa that the r
intention was to clear this govern
ment's position and ar.swer an advance
question which Germany might ask.
The document upholdi the right of !
merchantmen to arm for defence. draws
a distinction between their utatus on |
the high seas and in neutral water*, ;
points out that the rules laid down by i
this government cannot be taken as
conclusive against the character of.
such a vesnel and that il can only be |
legally treated as a war?hip when the
attacking vessel has absolute proof
that t: i? such.

not altered by instmetions fro-n the
ow-ner's government unle?s those in

, against German heavy artillery as those of Antararp and Mau

before tbe present battle began. Finally I have indicated thut <o
little military value wa Bttached tn Verdun by the French high command
that it was prepared to evacuate the whole position, whieh is the mott
dimeult to defend on thfl flrhole French front, and was only persuaded to
give over hia purpoaa by the ara*un*venta <.f th.- poltticiana, who l.eli,-\?* 1
that the moral effect of the evacuation arould be diaastroua to France and
