The Galahad of
Arizona:
Governor Hunt
Bv Peter Clark MacFarlane
(From Collier's Weekly)
The governor of Arizona is a
globular person from Globe.
Great as is the governor, s circum
ference, his name would, go clear
round him, for it is a four-cylinder
name George Wylie Paul Hunt.
Hunt's name has been in the
newspaper so often that many
people rise to inquire: "Hunt?
Hunt? Who is Hunt?"
This story is by way of reply:
In Arizona one does not belabor
a burro to make him advance;
one prods him with a sharp stick.
George Wylie Paul "punched a
burro" into Globe in 1881. Globe
was raw and crude in those days,
but not more raw and crude than
the George who, then but twenty--one
years old and having no
money and no profession, found
his first opening in the new town
as a waiter in a restaurant. This
job kept him' at work from four
in the morning to eight at night,
paid him $50 a month, and left
him at the end of two years with
savings of $1,00C and the deter
mination to become the governor
of the Territory. .
George was a queer waiter,
and spent his spare time reading
the Iliad in-translation or thumb
ing Greek and Roman history.
He is a. queer governor or at
least an aloof, eccentric sort of
governor.
By some accounts he is timid,
afraid of his own shadow and the
sound of his own voice jsuspicious
of his friends, but fearless to
ward his enemies; a stolid, de
termined person who will do
exactly what he will do; who
goes stubbornly upon his guber
natorial way in the face of a
galling fire of criticism, never
swerving never flinching at the
darts that rain into his sun-seared
skin, reminding one in a small
way of Cleveland in the unpopu
larity of his second term.
Yes, one sweeping glance at
the press of Arizona and you
perceive that Governor Hunt is
a combination of Benedict Arnold
and Cole L. Blease, and the most
unpopular man in a State whose
political fate is already signed,
sealed, and delivered. Yet lift
the lid and peer into his past and
.you discover that he has thriven
upon calumny, that he has, al
ways espoused the politically
unpopular, , that the press has
always heckled him, that at least
once in every party skirmish he
has fallen upon his own bowie
knife, and that it is the ' 'dodgast
ed pernicketiness" of the voters
of Arizona that keeps shoving the
rotund figure of George up on top
of the breastworks to draw his
enemies' fire.
To understand this predilection
of the voters foreven to smell the
smoking epidermis of George
Wylie Paul Hunt, scorching up
on one fire or another, it is need
ful to take a little pasear (walk)
up the canon and mark the ways
of this man. But, before we be
gin "Piutin' round" over his part
of the range, let us pause and
have a little understanding about
Arizona You thought it was one
of the "God-forgotten countries'?
Well, it is not. You had heard
that cynical tradition about the
devil's having besought the Diety
to let him have a hand in the
work o f creation, whereupon
Arizona was turned over to him
so muss up as he would, with the
result which the geographies and
the thermometers record? Ari
zona is not so bad. True, she has
cacti and deserts and tarantulas
and temperatures and Giia mon
stersbut what of that? Ari
zona has something to compensate
she has charm. There are moun
tains you can love, deserts you
can talk to. distances to calm
your soul. There are mountains
capped with perpetual snow.
There are lofty uplands of dron
ing pine that might be the parks
of giants. There are huge man
made lakes. The are torrential
rivers of rushing yellow water.
There are smoky mines at seared
spots on the mountain. There
are checker-board flats, modeled
after the Garden of Eden, in
which you will pass mile upon
mile of thick green cotton dotted
with its yellow flowers; mile upon
mile of alfalfa purpled by its
bloom, with fields of fat, dozing,
butter-giving cattle, and (strange
sight) pastures full of ostriches
thousands upon thousands o f
them looking at a distance like
other herds of cattle, but, as you
draw near, breaking into bat
talions and squadrons of those
foolish, prancing, plume-bearing
birds- While you strain your
eyes to watch them they have
gone. You are in the midst of
orange groves,' of figs or peaches,'
and the hum of the water wheel
catches your ear, and you see
where the snow of the mountains
is turned into electric power and
a trolley car propelled by the
snowflakes whizzes by.
DESERT WHERE ROSES BLOOM
Nature is at her nudest in Ari
zona. She wears not even a blush.
She is her honest self no bangs,
no puffs, no rouge or powder.
Arizona's colorings are nature's
own. She may appear as sterile
as a skull, but only to the unsee
ing eye, Arizona is the land of
mystery, of romance, of enchant
ment! The harshest elements
there melt and mold into symbols
of the sublime. I can show you
ash heaps to the glory of God in
Arizona, where some volcano
piled them high and where the
somber hues of their rounded
cones, pitted by the crater
mouths, soften the harsh outline
and subdue the garish color of a
red or yellow sandstone ledge
that like a palisade has split the
I picture from horizon to horizon.
But the people who live in Ari
zona? You thought they were
tardy-minded and uncouth? That,
too, was a misconception. There
is no more intelligent citizenship.
The people are bold,freethinking,
accustomed to wide horizons,
able to see far and reason clearly;
and when I say they are intelli
gent it does not mean just that
flood immigration of the last ten
years which has skimmed some of
the cream of other States; The
desert breeds intelligence. I will
pick you out, in in every quarter
of the State grizzled, bronzed,
guant figures of men who have
lived all their lives in these moun
tains; who have prospected, or
raised cattle, or driven stage, or
followed one of the professions,
yet men at whose feet you may
sit for hours entertained and in
structed by their conversation,
amazed at the deep wells of in
formation which they have bored
in the course of their lives. 1
will find you men who can instruct
you in the sciences, to whom
geology, archeology, astronomy,
philosophy, belles-lettres, govern
ment the latest achievements,
the most advanced and practical
departments of knowledge are
the stuff of their most familiar
thought.

Spring.
Spring is looked upon by many
as the most delightful season of
the year, but this cannot be said
of the rheumatic. The cold and
damp weather brings on rheuma
tic pains which are anything but
pleasant. They can be relieved,
however, by applying Chamber
Iain's Liniment. Obtainable
everywhere. Adv.

Dear Sir:
We have pleasure in enclosing
herewith a reply by Prof C. S.
Plumb of Ohio State University
to your recent, inquiry. Since it
would be several weeks before
we would be able to publish this
matter in The Gazette, we are
taking the liberty of mailing it
to you, as it occurred to us that
you might be interested in re
ceiving the information as soon
as possible.
Trusting that this will be satis
factory, we are.
Yours truly

The Heaviest Horse
W. B. P., St. Johns, Ariz.,
wishes to know of the heaviest
horse on record.
One finds very little on record
concerning the weight of draft
horses outside of the ordinary.
Europeans discuss the height of
the horse more than the weight;
conveniences for weighing ani
mals in Europe are few and far
between. A horse that will
weigh 2,200 is a large one, and
but few reach that weight. In
1908 the statement was .published
in some journals that Sylvester
Dory, of Minnesota, traded a
stud of Shetland ponies for a
horse standing 81 inches high
and weighing close t o 3,000
pounds. This is much the heavi
est horse of which I have any
record. C. S. Plumb, Ohio State
University. -
The home economics lecture was

report has been given to us.

Remember the dates and gat re
gistered. E. I, Whiting has p number of
men at work on the basement of
his new store building and they
are certainly making things hum.
The basement is as large or larger
than the one tnat is under the
Schuster store building, and it
will be finished about the latter
part of this week and then work
on the store proper will begin.
J. W. and A. S. Waite and
James Shreeve are the masons
on the job and they are putting
up a wall that will last forever.
Mr. Whiting is one of our most
progressive merchants and real
izes that to keea abreast of the
time he must have all modern
conveniences in his business and
we are informed that his ambi
tion is that he might at some
future date install a department
store.
This building is one of the big
progects under way in St. Johns
and like the Schuster building it
is furnishing work for a number
of men. The dimensions are
38x105 feet and will perhaps be
one and half story in height.
In airiikely hood others of our
merchants will get the fever and
do likewise.

Five automobile loads of relatives

Phoenix, Alamogordo, N. M.,
and this vicinity, followed the
corpse from here to its last rest
ing place in the mountains, a dis
tance of sixty miles. The burial
was a very simple but impressive
affair and at its close the grave
was covered with the profusion
of flowers tendered at the funeral
by sorrowing friends of Mesa.

Safe Medicine for Children.
"Is it safe?" is the first ques
tion to be considered when buy
ing cough medicine for children.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has
long been a favorite with mothers
of young children as it contains
no opium or other narcotic, and
may be given to a child as confi
dently as to an adult. It is pleas
ant to take, too, which is of great
importance when a medicine must
be given to young children, This
remedy is most effectual in re
leiving coughs, colds and croup.
