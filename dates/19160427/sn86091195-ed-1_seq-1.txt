BALL LEAGUE
IS ORGANIZED
Last Friday night sixty business men
and enthusiastic fans met in the law
office of Attorney Jones and organized
a local base ball league, with the fol
lowing officers: Chairman, James Mar
tin; secretary, Jack Stone; treasurer,
Wendell Gagon; manager, C. G. Haynes.
V'he board of directors chosen consists
of the above named officers and Frank
Garvin. A series of dances has been
planned, and will be under the manage
/ ment of Howard Biethan and Mark
Twohy. Much enthusiasm was mani
fested, and Blackfoot will surely have
a ball team if the citizens will take
as much interest in it as the officers
will. There is one sure thing and
that is, if the success of a ball team
depends on its manager, the new team
ean already be considered a grand suc
cess, as Mr. Haynes, we believe, will be
a live, active manager who will spare
neither time, energy or money to make
it the best ball team Blackfoot has ever
known.
Asylum Administrator Building.
Last Sunday Messrs. Reece and Fish
er, directors of the Idaho State Insane
Asylum at Blackfoot, in conjunction
with Superintendent Poynter of that in
stitution, had an informal meeting to
consider plans and specifications for
an administration building to that most
creditable institution. Through able
and economic management this local
state asylum has accumulated a surplus
of about $30,000, and the governor and
directors believe the long-felt want of
an administration building should be
satisfied. The crowded condition of
this institution would be greatly re
lieved by the proposed improvement
which would also be a great benefit to
the management. The institution that
has earned this surplus is entitled to
the benefit of it, and all fair-minded
citizens of the state will admit that it
will do more good in the proposed im
provement than turned into the general
asylum funds of the state, where it will
be practically unseen.
$18.00 VERDICT
The case of Dr. Roberts af Shelley,
and J. H. Carrier were tried in the pro
bate court last Monday, by a jury of six.
From the testimony the doctor treated
the defendant's wife for a chronic ail
ment which lie thought he could cure
for $50.00 worth of medicine. After"
taking $23.00 worth of the medicine the
patient thought she was getting
better, and ceased to further take the
medicine, and also refused to pay for
what she had taken on the ground" that
the doctor had guaranteed her a per
manent cure, an allegation that the med
iciue man denies.
After carefully considering the evi
dence, the jury decided on a verdict for
the doctor in the sum of $8.00, the dé
fendent to pay the costs of the suit.
J. M. Franklin Dead.
Word was received on Lost Rivei
last week that Mr. J. M. Franklin, who
formerly lived a few miles below Mac
kay, had died at Farmington, New
Mexico. The Franklins moved from
this vicinity several years ago, but
there still remains in the valley one
daughter, Mrs. Richardson, and three
sons, also a daughter at Blackfoot, Mrs.
Henry Vanderwood. The many friends
of the Franklin family will be grieved
to learn of Mr. Franklin 's death.—
Mackay Miner.
Jos. Cutler and wife leave Monday
for Los Angeles, where the latter will
remain indefinitely for the benefit of
her health. Mr. Cutler will return in
a few weeks.

THE CITY COUNCIL.
The city council held a regular ad
journed meeting Tuesday night, with
five members present and Mayor Peek
presiding, who stated the object of the
meeting was to determine the width of
sidewalks to be constructed for the pav
ing district.
Councilman Berryman, chairman of
the improvement committee, reported
that he had seen all of the property
owners in the proposed improvement
district and they had all signified their
willingness to replace the present 12
foot sidewalks on Main street with 20
foot walks. He further stated that he
could not get a conference with the
Oregon Short Line Railroad company
to ascertain what they were willing to
do; that they had made and broken
several engagements with him, and
were materially delaying the proposed
improvement. The matter was left in
the hands of the committee for further
investigation.
Mr. Kirkpatrick appeared before the
council and accused them of giving the
Idaho Lumber Company permission to
practically destroy his ditch, which they
had done, and threatened to sue thie
city for damages if it was not replaced
when he wanted it for irrigation. He
was assured by Councilman Stephens
that the lumber company would restore
his ditch in time for the irrigating sea
son, and Mr. Kirkpatrick went away
satisfied, stating that was all that he
wanted.
The location of the water main on
Bridge street is said to be on the prop
erty of Ben Lyons and Mark Farmer,
on account of which they refuse to
obey the paving mandate of the city
council. A reference to the franchise
granted the Blackfoot Water Works
Company disclosed the startling inform
ation that they had the right to lay
their water mains and pipes on all the
alleys, streets and public highways of
the city of Blackfoot and it seemed to
the council that if sidewalks are con
sidered public highways the water com
pany will not be compelled to move
their pipes.
Complaint was made against the nu
merous and gigantic manure piles on
the alley running south from East Ju
dicial, between Shilling and University
avenues, and it was threatened if the
city could not make the citizens of
Blackfoot remove these unsightly and
unsanitary nuisances, the state author
ities could and would without favorit
ism or mercy.
Musical Comedy to Return to Orpheum.
The LaSalle Stock Company will
make their second appearance* at the
Orpheum Theatre on Thursday, May 4,
in Oamnbell Oazad's musical farce com
edy, "Don't Lie to Your Wife." This
remarkable farce musical comedy scored
a run of over a full year at the La Salle
Theatre in Chicago where it broke all
records for receipts at that popular
'day-house, plaving to over a half mill
ion people in the year's run.
In "Don't Lie to Your Wife" Mr.
Cazad 1ms created a series of ludicrous
lituatious without a parallel in comedy
construction, and the interpolated mu
sical numbers are of the jingly, whis
tly kind that are so popular now. The
company presenting the show are iden
tically the same that presented ' ' Sep
tember Morn" here, which is in itself
a guarantee of an evening of unusual
entertainment. The LaSalle Stock
Company is the largest organization of
its kind that has ever played this ter
ritory and is composed of 25 people,
all exceptionally clever singers, danc
ers and comedians, and the chorus is
me of youth and bcautv.—Adv.

that we have stepped below our dig
nity, but it appears that some "hair
brained lean'' has presumed to inti

becomes necessary for us to engage in
gory combat at the fair grounds dia

wit:
Haynes—Formerly pitcher and book
keeper for the New York Americans.

cans.
Dustin—Twelve seasons second base

ELECTRIC COOKING BEST
Use of Electric Range means less work,
more economy and better results, says
Mrs. J. B. Brokaw formerly Mary
Gray Marston.
(Copyright, 1915, by Mary Gray Mars
toil.)
Few of us realize and especially the
housekeepers, that we have just about
reached the age when electricity will do
nearly everything for us that we have
to do.
The greatest benefit that we shall be
able to receive from the "electric age"
is that of being able to cook by this
power.
It will mean to the ordinary house
wife less house cleaning, less kitchen
cleaning, fewer utensils, less dish wash
ing, better food, smaller household sup
ply bills, and more time to rend, sew or
enjoy the pleasures of life.
It will mean more than all else, a
chance to rest and relax during the rush
and bustle of an ordinary day's routine
in this busy age.
More Done; Less Work
It will mean an opportunity not only
to lie able to do the housekeeping better
than ever before, to give better satis
faction to those for whom one is provid
ing, but to enlarge and broaden ones
talents.
We are able today, through the efforts
of the most central stations who have
been trying for some years to arrange a
practical cooking rate, to cook three
meals a day for six people, at an aver
age cost of $2.50 a month for fuel.
This rate in many cases is not com
parable with other methods of cooking,
to its advantage and economy exactly,
but the saving in being able to use less
expensive cuts of meats, to the lesser
... , „„ . .
shnnkage of food cooked and the possi
bilitv of using less materials with per-I
fectly good results, has more than bal- ;
anced up the difference m cost in the
animal household budgets to say no
thing of the elimination of worry, care
and nervousness attached to cooking on I
a stove to which one has to give eon
stant attention.
Takes Care of Self
One may cook on an electric range
and after the preliminary half hour in
starting things, the range may be left
for two or three hours without any at
tention whatever.
Electricity as a cooking agent gives
an absolutely dependable, even, consis
tent temperature.
While we have to remodel our ideas
about cooking with the electric range,
it has been found that the most inexper
ienced cooks may obtain excellent re
sults with it at once, and it has never
been found that a person using an elec
tric range two or three weeks could be
persuaded to use anything else, there
after.
Caah Market for Poultry and Eggs.
Mr. F. H. Sloan, one of the firm of
the Montana Poultry Exchange, of
Butte. Mont., is here and will open a ,
warehouse for the purpose of establish- l
ing a farmers' cash market for poul- '
try and eggs and at present is paying
14 cents for fat hens—the highest price
ever paid for poultry in this vicinity.
Will pay market price for eggs in cash
or trade.
For further information apply to the
undersigned at the Commercial Hotel, or
phone 42.
F. H. SLOAN,
Acceptance.
To the people—may they rule:
It has come to our attention that s
few fat-heads terming themselves thi
' ' Fat Base Ball Team, ' ' and posing ai
a large representative body of the cor
pulent element of this burg, has issued
a challenge to the slender and more act
ive citizenship, to appear at the fail
grounds next Sunday April 30, at 2:30
and cross bats to determine which ele
nient is superior in the nationol game
of base ball. We believe that to ac.
eept this challenge would be an insult
to our talent; in fact, the challenge it
self an insult, and in olden times would
be satisfied at the point of the sword.
The laws of the land only prevent m
from using this measure. We an
therefore compelled to accept their ehal
lenge and will vindicate our honor oi.
the ball field, watching the fat slobf
waddle after our long flies and go pant
ing after some slow grounder. Theii
sweat will turn to blood and their fat
to grease ere Sunday's sun sets in th<
west.
Be it recorded on the sands of time
that our team is:
G. V. Fisher—Walter Johnson's un
derstudy.
D. L. O'Neal—One season with Wap
ello Busters.
B. F. Pennington—Saw a ping-pong
game once, and thinks he can play base
ball.
Pee-Knuckle Ike—Greatest Jew base
ball player in captivity.
Charles Clarke—Intends to use a
"plumber's friend" to suck in the
balls.
Max Smith—A twister—never had
a hit made, off his pitching.
Frank Garvin—With Detroit all his
life.
Härtung —World-known paving catch
er.
M. M. Farmer—Chief hot air peddler;
would-be manager of this team.
Howard Henderson—Played with thir
famous Blackfoot team nineteen years
ago.
Beeny Stevenson—Ex-Giant star
bench warmer.
Watch us lick 'em!

BLACKFOOT AGAIN DUPED.
Last Tuesday, when T. H. Cornwell
a sewing machine agent, clandestinely
disappeared from his familiar quarters
in Blackfoot, several associates and a
few of his more confiding friends
mourned his departure, to the reported
.amount of about $175.00. Although a
pomparative stranger in this vicinity,
Cornwell had gained considerable not'o
riety, especially in connection with a
rura ] widow who is said to be both fat
and forty. The apparently gallant sew
i„g machine vender and the buxom
widow were discovered one night in
possession of the south entrance to the
High School in a must compromising
position by Deputy Sheriff' Dann, who
arrested Cornwell -and charged him with
vagrancy. Thinking he was getting off
very lightly, under the circumstances,
after a night in durance vile he con
cluded to plead guilty to the lesser of
crime, pay the $10 fine, and save the
name and reputation of bis female ac
cessory.
James Gibbs Bella Out.
Jack Stone has resigned his $1,00
federal situation in the local postoflice,
and has bought.James Gibbs' interest
in the Club cigar store, a business to
which he is no stranger, having been
once employed in the Murphy store
where he was quite a drawing card.
Kieu Girtoh, another of Murphy's ex
employes, is also now employed in the
Club. Mr. Gibbs will go to Burley,
whe re he will engage in business.
FALLS FROM HORSE .
Millard Boiee was thrown from his
horse last Saturday and knocked un
conscious, receiving several cuts in the
head and numerous other bruises. He
happened to fall while near the High
School building, and was taken care of
by Professor Vincent until he was able
to be moved. At last reports he was
said to be slowly improving.
BUYING BRES.
Rov Adams, who lives north of Wap
II", has bought up about forty colonies
f bees, ami as they were in all kinds
if hives and boxes, he is going to trans
fer them all into good new hives with
novable frames, to comply with the
Idaho state bee laws.
Mr. Adams bought his bees in immov
able frame hives for from $1 to $1.50
per hive, and when they are transferred
o the new hives they will be worth $6
per hive. Mr. Adams has joined the
Idaho Honey Producers Association, and
will co-operate with them iu selling his
honey and beeswax, and in buying cans.
We wish him success and" hope he
don't get stung, as many others have
been.
Many bee-keepers find it more con
venient to sell their bees than to bother
with transferring them to movable
.'rame hives, since the law compels them
to do so if they want to keep bees.

WILL FEAST AND BOOST.
Another attempt is being made to
gani/.e a commercial club in Blackfclot,
and as every known scheme to get
people together for that purpose has ....
late been in vain, a new- and very novel
plan has been devised by a few of
active boosters. About $80 has already
been collected for suppers to be giv
by the V. I. 8. and the various churcl es,
in the hope of inducing the citizens
and business men to assemble at the V.
I. S. rooms, and while enjoying a good
supper after their day's work, to discisn
the many advantages to be derived
the city as a whole by the formation
a live commercial club. Among 1
subjects to be discussed are the n
hotel and adjacent improvements, the
land office, an interurhan railroad, a
smelter, and the prospective town build
ing improvements. If all the contrib
utors of $1.50 attend these suppers snd
meetings, there will be something lo
ing along the proposed plans of boost
ing for the inducement of outside cap
ital and enterprise.
