Box Scores in the Journal
The State Journal has announced
that it will carry full box scores of
National, American and Western
league games throughout the base
ball season. This means that read
ers of the Journal who are lovers of
the great national pastime are to be
given the best there is in baseball
reporting. For the fan who is un
able to attend the game in person
there is nothing so satisfying as base
ball statistics in this form.
The Evening News also begins,
with the opening of the Western
League, to issue a G o'clock Sport
Extra. This will be a peach colored
sport sheet detailing the league
games and latest in war bulletins,
for sale on the streets.
The Journal is now selling at a
remarkably low price, $3.50 a year
with the Sunday Journal and its col
ored comic and special features: or
$2 a year without the Sunday paper.
In cities where the Evening .News
can give the readers better service,
the News may be substituted at the
same price as that quoted for the
Journal.
In addition to base ball, which
promises to be an all-absorbing topic
in many circles for some months to
come, thousands of readers will want
to follow the political conventions
and the fall election. A year's sub
scription to the Journal carries the
subscriber through the next session
of the Legislature. The thorough
ness with which the Journal "cov
ers" the legislature is a by-word
among newspaper men and laymen
the state over. Then there is the
great European war and the Mexi
can difficulty.
The Sunday Journal carris many
features of state interest, such as its
recently added state news page de
voted to social and allied events.
sent in by the Journal's large staff
of state correspondents. The color
ed comic is a great thing for the
children and Brisky and Zapp, the
funny philosophers, will thoroughly
amuse the grown-ups.
