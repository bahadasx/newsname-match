NEW FEDERAL
ARMY RE
SERVE
BILL PLANNED
Consider Regular Army and
National Guard In
sufficient. G ARRISON VOLUNTEER
PROJECT ABANDONED
Senate and House Commit
tees Want Prac
tical Test.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2(1. A grow
ing tendency to provide for a
federal army reserve. In addition to the
regular army and federalized national
guard, was manifest today In both the
houi'e and senate military commit
tees. Members of both committees
said they favored a practical test of
the possibility of forming a federal
volunteer army in peace times on
lines somewhat similar to the conti
nental army plan. The apparent In
tention to abandon the continental
project wholly was one of the causes
leading up to tho resignation of Sec
retary Garrison.
Tlie house committee, agreed today
upon general terms of a bill it expects
to get before the house within ten
days providing for n regular army
with an authorized peace strength of
14. '1,000 men; a federalized national
guard which would reach a fixed
minimum strength of 424,000 in five
years; adequate reserve systems for
both of these forces; tho organization
of civilian training camps with wide
discretion reposed In the war depart
ment as to the terms of enlistment,
training and government.
Agreed on plan.
The senate committee has agreed
tentatively to a plan under which
training camps would be authorized
In every congressional district where
sufficient men volunteered for train
ing under an obligation for war serv
ice. The maximum force to be thus
raised in any district would be a bat
talion or substantially the same num
ber as proposed for the first year of
the Garrison continental army plan.
The camps would be under command
of full complements of regular army
officers.
Members of both committees, while
saying they would support uny good
plan for federalizing tho national
guard as a first line force, frankly
admitted today that they had doubts
whether a requisite force could be
enlisted In the national guard, even
under the proposed federal pay and
regulation provisions. Representa
tive Kahn. who has advneated an ex
tension of the business men's train
ing camp idea to all citizens who
would not enlist In the regulars or
the national guard, said today that
with thirty thousand men already en
rolled for extensive military training
this summer, without government
aid, he had received assurances that
fully one hundred thousand would be
available next year under this plan.
Senate Favors Plan
Members of the sigiute committee,
are understood to take a similar view.
The tentative plan they are consider
ing is In addition to the regular army
and federalized national guard pro
posals and Is Intended to rearh men
who would not be found In either of
those services.
The house committee arrived at its
tegular army figures as a comprom
ise after suggestions of a peace
strength of two hundred and twenty
thousand; one hundred and eighty
thousand, and one hundred and fifty
thousand had been voted down by
narrowing margins, A nonpartisan
vote finally fixed upon 137,000 or two
thousand more than recommended by
the war department, with a provision
designed to allow a percentage of over
enlistment to maintain that strength
at all times. With this provision the
total strength authorized would be
143,000. To provide officers to carry
out work of Instruction at sc hools,
among militia regiments and for other
special duties, one thousand addition
al men in the commisioncd personnel
was agreed upon as against an In
crease of 7S6 proposed by the war de
partment. Incrcaw In Fields
The Increases over the department
figures would be In field and coast
artillery, the former being doubled
over its present strength. A total of
12 regiments of 108 batteries is con
templated. The mine and torpedo
defenses and one half the guns in
fixed fortifications would be available,
with an additional complement to man
the proposed mobile guns to be ad
ded. The bill also provides that a na
tional guard officer from each organ
ization bo detailed to attend regular
army service schools of the proper
urms, receiving tho pay of his rank
in the regular army whileon such
duty. It contemplates authorizing the
president to draft tho guard Into the
federal service ut any time ho deems
best, without awaiting specific author
ity of congress, and would remove all
restrictions on the force outside the
country.

TIOHART. Okla., Feb. 26. The
JTj Seventh district, uuotlier one of
the so-called Harris strongholds, failed
to show the big mujorlty for the Harris

A, most Impregnable Defense.
Tho French, however, are defending
their stronghold with notable tenacity
and. according to Various accounts,
inflicting terrible losses on the at
tacking forces, Paris has not con
ceded the fall of Fort Doiiiiumont,
although admitting Hint the fighting
there had taken on an extremely snn
gimiry character and It only men
tions the Woevre region In an an
nouncement that the advanced post
held for observation purposes along
the line from Dines to Heiinemonl
has been attacked by the German
Infantry. The German utlaeks along
the front are declared by Paris to
be made without regard to the losses
sustained.
Notwithstanding the concentration
of attention upon the great struggle
on the western front, the current dis
patches show that events of consid
erable Interest, while not coiniuirablo
in Importance to thoHe around Ynr
dun, are happening In other war
theaters.
Hnss Tnke Persian City.
From Persia comes the Russian an
nouncement that the Important city
of Kermanshali has been taken by
storm by Russia's forces. Recent
Petrograd advices have tndieated an
expectation that the southern move
ment of this Russian army might
eventually link it up with the Itritish
operation In neighboring Mesopotamia.
The advance to Kcriminshnh places
the Russian column within lfiO miles
of Kiil-KI-Amara on the Tigris, near
which a Itritish force Is at present
stalled on Its march lo the relief of
General Towushend's beleaguered
army at Kat-Kl-A mara.
