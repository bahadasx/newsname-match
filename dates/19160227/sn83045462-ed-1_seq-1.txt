Local Organization Asks Leaders in

, on Author of the Proposed
Measure.
The fight against the Borland
rider to the legislative, executive
and judicial appropriation bill,
which provides that government
employes shall work an hour
longer each day without any extra
compensation, was given an
impetus yesterday when Representative
(iallivan of Massachusetts,
a democratic member of the
House committee, served notice
he would file a minority report,
and labor leaders in Mr. Borland's
home town, Kansas C'itv. were
asked to help defeat the measure.
Representative (iallivan declared
that the heads of departments.
bureau chiefs and others
who had testified before the com
mntce had shown that not only
were the department clerks not
shirkers, but, on the other hand,
often already do much overtime
work.
J. F? (files, president of the
Stenographers, Typewriters.
Bookkeepers and Assistants'
Union, telegraphed to Kansas
City and enlisted the aid of the
labor men there.
. Gets Permission From the House.
Representative Gallivan was not able
-to be present at the meeting of the
committee when the Borland provision
was tacked on the bill without previous
investigation. However, he took
the pains to look into the matter yesterday.
and determined to fight it. .Just
before the House adjourned Representative
Gallivan arose and asked
unanimous consent to file a protesting
Report against the legislative bill, as
far as the Borland provision is concerned,
and the House gave him permission.
He will probably file the report
early this week.
In discussing the subject Mr. Gallivan
said:
"The Borland rider is not legislation
in favor of an eight-hour day.
It is legislation directly opposed to the
principle and practice ??f an eight-hour
day. The principle of eight-hour legislation
and the practice of its enforcement
is that the employe shall not
w u; k more man t-igni nuurs. i ne let- j
tcr of the Borland ptovtslon arul the
spirit is that the employe shall not
work less than eight hours.
Alleges Defects in Provision.
"Mr. Borland has been quoted as saving
that the legislation he now proposes
will equalize working conditions
among all government employes in and
out of Washington; he declares that it
is in line with the law limiting the
hours of service for government employes
out of W ashington. This statement
is absolutely misleading. The
law applied to employes outside of
Washington is an eight-hour law. be*
cause it prohibits the government from
working those employes more than
eight hours. Tins proposal in no way
abridges the right and practice of administrative
officers of the government
to require ten arid twelve hours' work
a day in rush times.
"The testimony taken at hearings on
the legislative bill shows that practi- j
| cally every bureau and division chief. |
Secretary and assistant secretary, i
testifier! that much overtime work is
done by clerks under their direction. I
No large employer of private labor, j
whether an eight-hour law is in effect
or not in his establishment, would consider
for a minute requiring overtime
labor, other than in exceptional cases,
without providing extra compensation
therefor If an eight-hour law were in
effect he would necessarily be estopped
from requiring non-compensatory overtime.
if the eight-hour law w|ere not
in effect puolic opinion, the demands of
labor and the desire for efficiency
would require overtime provision.
"If the House wants to pass an eight
hour law for civil service employes, it
must make this necessary provision for
overtime. No such provision is carried
in the Borland rider. Practically speaking.
the Borland rider has been considered
by one man ? its author. It should
be considered ill the light of all the
facts by a legislative committee after
full and fair investigation and with a
view to the rights of all concerned."

Poisoning of Soup Suspected,
But the Alarm Proves to
Be Merely a Stunt.
PROMINENT MEN TARGETS
FOR THE SHAFTS OF WIT
Inauguration of President Strayer
Delayed Until Roosevelt Could
Be Heard From.
mm
MH IS U. STRAVRR.
For a few minutes. at the Gridiron
Club's dinner at the New Willard Hotel
last night, it seemed as if the occasion
would be marred in the outset by a
most deplorable and embarrassing incident.
President Wilson. Vice Prcsi- I
dent "Marshall, members of the cabinet
and the company of other distinguished
guests were appalled.
It came about this way: When the
soup was .served one of the members
of the club was seen to be in an excited
and irritable state. Another member
of the club was trying to pacify
him. but without avail. It was shocking
and everybody expressed consternation.
"I will -not sit down," cried the obstreperous
member, "and 1 don't care
if I am making a scene. I tell you
there is something the matter with
the soup. You know what happened
out in Chicago the other night. I don't
claim there is poison in this soup, but
we must protect our guests."
"Oh, this cannot be tolerated for a
moment," said President Strayer of
the Gridiron Club; "this is disgraceful."
"But there is something the matter
with 'he soup."
Hotel Manager Called.
"Call in Mr. Hight. the manager of the
hotel," commanded Mr. Strayer. Thereupon,
Mr. Hight appeared and suggested
that to satisfy the protesting
member he would have the soup
caldron brought In. Forthwith appeared
the chef with the soup kettle
and the complainant was given a long
spoon to sample the contents.
His suspicions proved well founded.
There was something in the soup. He
spooned up a variety of things, including
the continental army bill, the Colombian
treaty, the low cost of living
plank of the Baltimore platform and
a few other articles of soup stock.
Mr. Hight tried to explain, but his
words were lost in the clatter of
spoons as the relieved guests betook
themselves to the very excellent turtle
in their Own plates.
But this is getting ahead of the story.
The narrative really should begin with
the arrival of the guests, their commingling
in the small ballroom, the
coming of the President of the United
States and his leading of the procession
Into the big banquet hall, most
gloriously decorated with flowers and
greens and resplendent in light: with

stood while a song of welcome was
rendered by the Gridiron Quartet and
President Strayer made a brief but
happy introduction, followed by the
Hashing of the big electric gridiron,
which * is the signal that the bridle is
off. and, barring the fact that "ladies
are always present, constructively, and
reporters never present." the guests
can go as far as they like.
President Strayer Grilled.
It was not long after the soup incident
until something else happened.
Ixiuia W. Strayer of the Pittsburgh Dispatch.
the newly elected president of
the club, was to be inaugurated, and
according to Gridiron tradition, had to
be grilled himself before presiding
over the roasting of innocent guests.
An old-time Inaugural parade entered
the hall, led b> a band and a drum

At the outset the progressive party I
objected to the inauguration of President
Strayer until he could assure himself
that the president had received
the indorsement of <*ol. Roosevelt. He
withdrew to consult the colonel by
wireless, but in the meantime several
newspaper correspondents who had recently
visited the colonel entered the
room and reported.
Reports From Col. Roosevelt.
Said the flrst one: "I have just returned
from Bermuda, and while I am
not at liberty to quote Col. Roosevelt,
I feel that I may nay that he will accept
as a presidential nominee Charles
K. Hughes. Theodore E. Burton, Philander
C. Knox, Albert B. Cummins,
Elihu Root or Herbert S. Hadley."
The next report was this:

say that he regards Burton as worse

Has Accomplished Purpose.
Last night Senator Gore of Oklahoma,
author of a resolution warning Americans
to keep off armed merchantmen
flying flags of belligerent nations, issued
a statement to the effect that the
objects sought in his resolution had
been accomplished through public discussion.
Representative McLemore of Texas,
who has a similar resolution in the
House, announced that he was content
to wait until the President and Secretary
Lansing had an opportunity to
try out their policy.
But while members of the Senate and
House who are opposed to having this
country thrust into war over the issue
now pending, the right of neutrals to
travel on armed merchantmen, have
agreed to give the administration free
rein to effect through diplomaUe means
an adjustment of the matter, the impression
was strong at the Capitol last
night that they would not quietly
acquiesce in any steps which would lead
to war." Senator Lewis of Illinois, the
democratic whin of the Senate, re
ported a canvass of the Senate showed
that the Gore resolution could not be
adopted "at this time." But the resolution
is sti 11 pending in the Senate,
and should occasion warrant may be
called up.
Insists on Americans' Safety.
Meanwhile the State Department is
awaiting further communications from
Germany in regard to the armed
merchantman question. Secretary
Dan sing indicated that under certain
circumstances the United States was
prepared to discuss with the German
government what may properly be regarded
as defensive armament for
merchant vessels. In no event, however,
will the United Slates be a party to
such negotiations, it was said, unless
it is assured that American lives will
not be endangered during the course
of tiie discussion.
Although it was admitted that a postponement
of the operation of the order
of the German admiralty to treat
armed merchantmen as war vessels
would not come as a surprise, merewas
T?o indication last night that such
a postponement would materialize.
It was- Indicated at the State Department
yesterday that Germany by recent
acts had shown a disposition to change
her original position in regard to the
right of merchant ships to carry defensive
armament. Originally the Berlin
government denied that it was legal
for merchant ships to arm at all.
Now some officials here consider that
Germany appears willing to admit that
armament is legal if purely defensive.
In other words. It is believed the German
government actually Is attempting
to change the rules rather than the
law. v

to port authorities issued
September 9, 1915, which permit merchant
ships to clear from American
ports provided they are carrying no
more luan uiwuuieu an, or
not more than six-inch caliber. As a
matter of fact, no merchant ships ever
have come into American waters with
the maximum of armament provided
for. Indications that this question
would be opened for discussion resulted
from publication of confidential
advices from Berlin, which forecast a
request from Germany to the United
States to define defensive armament.
State Department officials were emphatic
in saying that while additional
limitations might be placed upon the
defensive armament that may be carried
such action could not be extended
to require the complete exclusion of
armament. That would be equivalent,
it is held, to a change of international
law which cannot be made durfna th?
course of hostilities, except by general
assent. There are strong Intimations
that the entente allies will not consent

LONDON. February 26.?The Amsterdam
correspondent of the Central News
learns that heavy fighting: has taken
place ten miles from Bitlis between
Russian and Turkish troops, the former
coming from the direction of Mush, and
that the Turks fought bravely, but were
obliged to retire before superior forces.
The resistance offered by the Turkish
forces retreating from Erzerum to the
advancing Russians apparently has
frittered out on account of the general
lack of ammunition and supplies, according
to Petrograd advices. Unable to
defend points of natural advantage, the
Turks are continuing their precipitate
flight into the fastnesses of Asia Minor.
Assistance Crippled.
The loss of Ishpir, which was an im
portant munition and food depot, serving
the right wing, the Turkish coast
troops, and the left wing, the Eriserum
forces, further crippled the power of
Turkish resistance. It also cut off main
road communication between Erzerum
and Trebizond. This means that the
Turkish troops, which are recreating
from Erzerum upon Trebizond, can now
only reach the coast through a difficult
mountain district, where they will be
within striking distance of the Russian
Black sea fleet, whose bombardment of
the Armenia littoral continues.
Coast Army Cut Off.
The Turkish coast army, likewise cut
off, is now in a precarious position
with the possibility of a Russian attack
in its rear. Military experts
agree that it is only a matter of a few
days before the whole district occupied
by the Turkish left flank will become
unicnaoic.
The capture of Ishpir is pointed to as

SUPERIOR, Wis., February 26.?
Watchmen guarding big grain elevators
containing millions of bushels
of wheat for the allies were alarmed
early today when an aeroplane, soaring
3,000 feet in the air, circled above
the docks for nearly half an hour.
The machine was first noticed lust
before dawn. When it became light it
disappeared in the direction of the new
plant of the Minnesota Steel Company
on the St. Louis river.
An aeroplane was recently sighted
over a small station near the du Pont
powder plant at Washburn.
The identity of the mysterious aeroplane
had not been cleared tip tonight.
Half a dozen employes of the Great
Northern railway working in the shops
near Allouez described the machine at
length today.
Several nights ago Duluth residents,
according to dispatches, said they saw
moving lights in the sky and heard
the exhaust of a motor. There is no
aeroplane known to be owned or operated
in this district.
