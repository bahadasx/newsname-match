SENATOR WILLIAMS STANDS
FOR SAILING PUIS
SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD BE
GIVEN PROTECTION ON
ALL VESSELS.
Washington, Feb. 24. Whether
the nation shall stay on the ' Rock
of Intcrnatinal Law," or whether it
shall venture from it in an effort to
barren-" the- American people, Is ' the
matter uppermost today in the minds
of every member of the Senate and
House. Opinion differs among Louis
iana and Mississippi members. This
is what Senator John Sharp Williams
thinks: 1
"As an individual I would not take
passage on board a belligerent ship
if an American or a neutral ship
were available. This action, however,
would be prompted by my desire to
reduce my personal danger to the
minimum. But if I had urgent bus
iness and no neutral ships were avail
able, I most certainly would utilize
an available belligerent ship and I
would expect my government to pro
tect me. This is the personal aspect
of the situation and I believe it is
typical of the view held by the aver
age American.
"The national aspect is so clearly
defined that it is hard to understand
why any other course could be con
sidered by a Well informed person.
The President has no right to advise
a citizen that the nation will not pro
tect him in his historic right to travel
the high seas.
"The Germans are trying to change
international law to suit' their needs.
They are trying to make us agree to
uch a change. It is a well recognized
principle that when neutrals change
recognized conditions so as tc affect
nfairly one of the belligerents, it
'mmits an unueutral if not an un
friendly act. In addition to the rights
of an American citizen to claim pro
lection from his goverment, there is
e rit ht of belligerents that we do
nothing to detract from advantage
gained.
"A good niany congressmen and
senators are running around like
chickens with their heads off, excited
by talk and full of superficial sug
gestions, but they will take refuge on
the rock of international law. The
majority of each party strongly
favors protecting American rights
against any nation.
Meantime, there is no imminent
danger of war unless the Germans
choose to have war. If Germany
should decide to make war upon this
country it would be like that fabled
contest of the bull against' eclipse,
If Germany forces the United States
to assume an attitude of war, she
could not transport a policeman to
our coast. I, for one, think the Ger-
man government has better sense.
"Even if it comes to war, wt need
not have war against the German
people or against the German gov
ernment, but only against the Ger
man submarines, those murderer of
the seas. As soon as we could chase
andysink them, we could come on
home. We would make no allium
with the allies, although if Germany
should pick a quarrel with us, we
would have to co-operate with the
aluw to a certain extent

VISION OF PATRIOTIC
ORGANIZATIONS.
At the annual meeting of the Mis
issippl Division, Daughters of the
American Revolution, which was held
in Greenville last week, Mrs. T. B
Fianklin, of this city, was elected
regent. Mrs. Franklin has long been
prominent in club life not only in
Columbus but throughout the state,
being a member of the Daughters of
the American Revolution, the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, the
Ladies' Reading Circle and other pa
triotic and literary organizations.
.She is a highly cultured and most
public-spirited woman, and the honor
recently conferred upon her at
Greenville was worthily bestowed.
The following press dispatch from
Greenville gives a succinct account
of the meeting:
The state ponference of the
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion closed the three days' session
this evening after a successful busi
ness meeting and with many social
honors extended them. , Officers
elected for the ensuing year were:
"Mrs. T. B. Franklin, of Colum.

local chapter, of a blue bird spoon to
the thrce-months-old daughter of
Mrs. Ross Collins, of Jackson. Mrs,
Collins spoke for her daughter, say
ing that the souvenir was accepted

Although positive identification
las not been established, the he.mf
now prevails that the body of the
an who was killed in wreck on
the Mobile and Ohio railroad near
uhl, Ala., last Monday and which
as been reposed in a local under
taking establishment awaiting the
coming of some one who knew him
that of Henry East, the notorious
Alabama criminal, who escaped from
the custody of officers on a railroad
rain between Lewisburg and Con-
ersville, Tenn., on February 12. A
picture of East has been received
ere, and its resemblance to the un-
entified man is remarkable.
The belief that the unclaimed
body is that of East was strengthen-
I Friday, when the fact was estab-
shed that Stanley Kopczymanski,
ho was injured in the wreck and
ho is now in a local hospital, knows
the name of his dead comrade but
will not reveal it. It is surmised that
opczymanski and East were mixed
p togetherf in some crime, and the
Russian fears that, identification of
the body will lead to his arrest.
M. P. Richardson, who work for
local laundry, states that he saw
the dead man in Denver last Decem
ber and later ran across him in St.
Louis and other cities, but asserts
that he does not know his name.
Richardson stated that when , h-
saw the dead man in Denver ift
Decemhet he was posing as a dummy
n the window of the May ClotuM
Company in that city. Local mi)rad
officials early in the week sent
telegram to this concern requesting
reformation regarding the unknown,
but up to yesterday afternoon no re-
plv to this message had been re
ceived.
Kopczymanski and the negro Will
Johnson, who were both injured in
the wreck and who were brought to
a local hospital, were sitting up yes
terday and reported to be well on the
road to recovery.
Hundreds of people have viewed
the corpse at the undertaking estab-
ishment of Messrs. Gunter Brothen
on College street, and pictures of the
dead man have been sent to the
daily papers in New Orleans, Mem
phis and Birmingham in the hope
that his identification could be estab-
shed, but all efforts in this direc
tion have proven futile. It is truo
h-l the body may be that of Harrv
F.ai-t, but it has been viewed by no
ore that ever saw the Alabama felon
n life, and therefore positive identi
fication has not been forthcoming.

TRAGEDY OCCURRED AT Mc
CRARY ABOUT 2 O'CLOCK
YESTERDAY.
Gilbert Ilarri.-on and James Mc-
(.'raw, both negroer living near Mc
Cr.it v, Miss., engaged in . difficulty
yesterday which ended fatally tj the
att-r, who was shot by his adver
sary and died almost immediately.
The weapon used was . shotgun.
The difficulty occurred near Mi
Crary about 2 o'clock in the aftr-
noon, and it is said to have been
precipitated by jealousy, the bellig
erents having been rivals for the af
fections of a dusky charmer of the
female sex.
After having shot McGraw Harri
son made his escape, but Sheriff
Williams soon had a posse of depu
ties out sea thing for him, and stated
over the telephone last night that he
hoped to catch him before morning.
