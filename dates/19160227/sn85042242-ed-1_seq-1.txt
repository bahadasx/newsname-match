United States Ready to Discuss
Matter of Defensive Arma­
ment
3 DAYS MORE BEFORE
ORDER 18 EFFECTIVE
Congress will take no action—
Awaiting word from Pre*
sident Wilson
Washington, Feb. 26.—Secretary
Lansing indicated today that the
United States was prepared under
certain circumstances to discuss with
the German government what may
properly be regarded as defensive
armament for merchant ships. In
no events, however, according to
authoritative information tonight,
will the United States be a party to
such negotiations unless it is assur­
ed lhat the lives of American citi­
zens aboard ships armed for defen­
sive purposes will not be endangered
during the course of the discussion.
Only three days remain before Ger­
man and Austrian submarine com­
manders will be instructed to treat
armed merchant ships as war ves­
sels. There was no indication today
that issuance of the order announced
in formal notification from the Cen­
tral powers for February 29, would
be postponed,- although it was ad­
mitted that a postponement would
not. come aB a surprise.
Leaders in both houses of congress,
who for several days have agitated
passages of a resolution warning
Americans not to travel on armed
ships, seemed convinced tonight that
no such measure could be put
through at present.
Object Secured Already.
Senator (lore, who has such a res­
olution pending, issued a statement
saying that, while he still favored a
warning, he believed the object
aougbt' by bis resolution already had
been achieved through public discus
sion.
Representative McLemore, whose
warning resolution. ijt the house has
beeh kept from coming up by admin­
istration leaders, slid he was con
tent to wait until the president- and
Secretary Lansing

opportunity to
try out their policy of asserting the
right of travel on ships bearing
arms.
Administration officials still were
awaiting the receipt of the additions
to the latest German memorandum
on the subject, which contained what
is alleged to be ft copy of confiden­
tial instructions given to 'British sea
captains. If this document contains
what, the German government claims,
it is said to be probable an inquiry
may be addressed to Great Britain
on the subject.
Germany Gives Reason.,
The British government some' time
ago assured' the United States that
its merchant ships would not operate
offensively.
Germany, in its memorandum,
gives as one of the cardinal reasons
for its determination to sink'armed
merchant ships of her en^niy: With­
out warning, the fact that German
submarines have been fired on re­
peatedly by merchantmen which ap­
parently were engaged in peaceful
pursuit of commerce.
The first formal reply to the Amer­
ican suggestion made weeks ago for
the disarming of merchant ships
came today from Italy. It will not
be made public until all the Allies
have responded, but it was learned
that the document, was not conclus­
ive but rather was argumentative.
While agitation on the subject in
congress has subsided for the time
being, the disposition on the part of
leaders in the movement for a con­
gressional warning seemed tonight to
be a waiting one.
TO ANSWER SOON.
Washington, Feb. 26.—Great Brit­
ain has informed Ambassador Page
at London that it will reply to the
American note regarding interfer
ference with neutral mails and the
trading with the enemy act,. at the

the result of conferences with her
allies before responding.

Hit Here
After two unsuccessful attempts
in past seasons to produce "The Bird
of Paradise" here, Oliver 'Morosco,
last night, gave Bismarck play lovers
one of the oddest and most unique
dramas they have had an opportun­
ity of witnessing.
The scene of the play is laid in
Hawaii, and the stage settings last
n^ght carried one bodily to Uncle
Sam's far off island possessions. The
singing and playing of the native
Hawaiian Quintet, added a realism to
the production which nothing else
could.
The love story of Paul Wiilson, a
young American physician, who suc­
cumbs to the charms of Luana, the
Hawaiian princess, the beautiful
"child of Pele," the sacred volcano,
which all the Kanakas worship. The
power of suggestion is strong in Wil­
son and he falls an easy victim to
-Luana's charms.
The uplifting of "Ten Thousand
Dollar" Dean, a piece of human flot­
sam, by Diana Larned, the American
girl, marks the contrast, in, the play,
which is primarily a, sermon against
race intermarriage. in fin^act,
after fully betifiVjng herself ioi.be con­
verted to the Christian religion, Lu
apa goes back to her people and sac­
rifices herself to the angry Pele, to

stagecraft.
TRIPLE SHOOTfNG.
Decatur, 111., Feb. 26.—Two dead
and one dying is the result of a triple
shooting here today. William H.
'Norman, aged 35, shot Miss Emma
.Harris, a friend, and then turned the
revolver upon himself, dying three
hours later.
iMrs. Norman, his wife, who was
a witness, grabbed the weapon and
shot herself through the tempie, dy­
ing instantly. Jealousy is said to have
caused the tragedy.
Priioner
In a Tree
Oskaloosa, la., Feb. 26.—Charles
Thomas is probably the most uncom­
fortable young man in the United
states tonight. He is perched on the
limb of a tree in the Des Moines riv­
er, seven miles southwest of this city,
and boats cannot reach him because
of floating ice. Thomas not only is
marooned in the dark, but his cloth­
ing is wet, and he has not eaten
since noon.
The adventure which landed Thom­
as in the tree caused the death of A.
E. Rommell, official engineer of Ma­
haska county. The two men, who
are well known, started out in a skiff
to dynamite an ice gorge. The boat
was capsized by a big cake of ice
and Rommell was drowtoed.

MILITARY BILL
BEING WRITTEN
Will be ready for Consideration
of House at an Early
Date
Washington. Feb. 26.—A growing
tendency to provide for a federal
army reserve in addition to the regu­
lar army and the federalization of
the National Guard was manifest to­
day in both the house and senate
military committees.
Members of both committees said
they favored a practical test of the
possibilities of forming a federal vol­
unteer army in peace time on lines
somewhate similar to the continent­
al army plan. The apparent inten­
tion to abandon the continental pro­
ject was one of the causes leading
up to the resignation of Secretary
Garrison.
Training Camps.
The house committee agreed today
on the general terms of a bill it ex­
pects to get before the house within
ten days, providing for a regular
army with an authorized peace
strength of 143,000- men, a federaliz­
ed National Guard which would
reach a fixed minimum strength of
424,000 in five years, adequate re­
serve systems' for fobl!*1 'a ef .these
forces, artd*' organization of' civilian
training camps, with wide discretion
reposed in the war department, as to
Hid terms of enlistment, training, and
government.
The senate committee has agreed
tentatively to a plan under which
training camps would be authorized
in every congressional district, where
KUffbUejifc roan ivohli^aM^ioiv^lwAa'
ing under an obligation for war ser­
vice. The maximum force to be thus
raised in any district, would be a bat­
talion or substantially the same num
ber proposed for the first year of the
Garrison continental army plan, The
camps would lie under command of
a full complement of regular army
officers.
New Equipment.
Experimental..Iqnge-range firing by
the Atlantic fleet, and information
about naval battles in the European
war virtually have convinced the
navy department that ships to be
authorized this year should carry ten
16-inch guns instead of twelve 14
inch guns aboard ships of the Penn
sylvania and California class, now
building or built.
Details of gunnery are confiden
tial, but it became knQwn tonight
that the next target practice of the
fleet will be held at ranges up to
18,000 yards, because of the lesson
taught by the battle between Ger­
man and British cruisers in the
North sea, where 1,700 shots scored
hits.
TO TRAIN AVIATORS.
New York, Feb. 26.—A course of
training in the use of aeroplanes for
officers of the militia in each of the
48 states, and $40 to each officer to
ward defraying expenses incidental
to the training, are offered in a let­
ter sent today to the governors of
the states by Allan R. Hawley, pres­
ident of the Aero Club df America.
The course will "be contributed by
an aeroplane company and the $40 by
the Aero club.
WOMAN DENIES
SALARY WAS SPLIT
Chicago, Feb. 26.—Positive denial
that Mrs. Page Waller Eaton had
been compelled to contribute part of
her salary as a city employe to the
relief of a relative of Mayor Thomp­
son was made today by Mrs. Louise
Osborne Rowe, head of the city de­
partment of public welfare, to whom
Mrs. Eaton had testified she had
made the alleged payments.
Mrs. Rowe's denial was made from
the witness chair, before the civil
service commission investigating the
charges.
After leaving the witness stand to­
day, Mrs. Eaton was quoted as saying
that she had obtained information
which exonerated 'Mayor Thompson
from all knowledge of the payments
which she said she had made to Mrs.
Rowe for the benefit of Mrs. Mar­
garet E. Mivelaz, the mayor's sister
in-law.
,Mrs. Rowe contradicted the story
told by Mrs. Eaton, who had quoted
the head of the welfare department as
saying "Maizie says you will have to
come across," referring to Mrs.
Thompson, with the payment of a
third of her salary to 'Mrs. Rowe.
WORK ENDED ROMANCE.
Chicago, Feb. 26.—According to tes­
timony in court here today, Charles
H. McCormick lived through 20 years
of married life without performing
any labors. Then on Labor Day, 1314,
he went out to look for work. He
never came back. Mrs. McCormick

tonight the bodies of two unidenti­
fied men were found lying near the

MAKE BELIEVE RAILROAD
A FEATURE OF EVENING
Fun and Amusement galore creat­
ed by Arrival of the Various
Passengers
Washington, Feb. 26.—The Gridiron
club tonight, at its second dinner of
the winter, projected itself into the
convention activities of next June
and helped a distinguished party of
presidential makers and candidates
board trains for Chicago and Sa. Lou­
is, to meet the fates awaiting tbem
there. In a make-believe railway .sta­
tion the actor 'members of the club
satirized the foibles of some of their
guests and some well known men
who were not. present.
President Wilson was among those
who looked on and he may have re­
ceived an intimation of the opposi­
tion he will meet later in the year.
Vice President '.Marshall, the secre
^arifiR Qt state, navy and interior,, the
Brazilian ambassador, tfce Chinese
and Bolivian ministers, several mem
bers of the senate and house, officers
of the army and navy, and a number
of the jnost notable figures in the
nation's financial and industrial life
were present.
The most ambitious of several
sketches presented by the club was
the political one. Scrambles to make
trains, strange traveling companions
and ticket complexities that confound'
ed the railway gatemen offered extra­
ordinary opportunities for fun-making,
Passing through the Chicago gate
were regular and progressive repub
licans, characters representing for
mer Vice President Fairbanks, Sen
ators Sherman, Borah, Cummins
Weeks, and Penrose (Representative
Cannon, former President .Roosevelt
William (Barnes and George W. Per
kins of New York. Through the ,St
Louis gate passed Secretary McAdoo,
Postmaster General Burleson, Charles
F. iMurpby of New York and William
Jennings E'ryan.
Nervous and Fussed.
The first passenger to reach the
Chicago train was recognized by one
of the two gatemen as Senator Bur
ton. Nervous and fussed, he inquired
if he were too late and appeared
greatly relieved when told that he
was "leading the parade."
"You won't be too late till you get
to Chicago," he was informed as the
gateman punched his ticket.
Next came a passenger for St. Lou­
is, who was haled as Secretary Mc­
Adoo. He produced a weird looking
ticket, finally recognized as mileage,
which the gateman examined labori­
ously. Muttering that it seemed "as
complicated as the shipping bill," the
gateman asked if a mistake hadn't
been made. Its intricacies were ex
plained by methods of addition and
subtraction, and the passenger pass
ed through, grinning. The gateman,
recovering, remarked to his pal
'That wasn't no railroad ticket that
was today's treasury statement."
Among the next batch of passen­
gers was a tall, heavy-set man, car­
rying a broken plank under his arm,
who tried to crowd through the St
Louis gateway.
"Hey, ,Mr. Speaker," expostulated
the gateman, "this ticket ain't no
good. It reads for Baltimore. And
it's four years old."
Ticket No Good.
'I knew it!" shouted the passen­
ger, who resembled Champ Clark.
"Bill Hearst told me to try to work
it off, 'but the darn ticket never was
any good."
The speaker finally got through on
"Missouri mileage," but the plank be­
came wedged in the gateway. As he
tried to disengage it he explained that
it. "came out of the Baltimore cy­
clone," and wa sthe last surviving
bit of the one-term plank. They ask­
ed him what good it was, and he re­
plied that he was merely following
T. R.'s advice—'Learn to swim, but al­
ways carry a life-preserver.'"
Vice President Marshall, extremely
nervous, was closely followed by Sen*
ator Lewis of Illinois.
"I ought to be nervous," he ex.
plained. "He follows me all the
time. He followed me up to the ros­
trum in the senate today and almost
sat in the chair."

ARTILLERY BLASTING
Notwithstanding the concentration
of attention on the great struggle on
the western front, events of consid­
erable interest, while not comparable
in importance to those ardund Ver­
dun, are happening in other war the­
aters.
'Russians Make Headway.
From Persia conies the Russian an­
nouncement that the important city
of Kermanshah has been taken by
storm by Russia's forces. Recent
Petrograd advices have Indicated ah
expectation that the southern move­
ment of this iRussian army might)
eventually link it up with the British.
operations in neighboring 'Mesopota­

places the iRussibn column within 150
miles of Kut^El-Amara, on the Tigris,
near which a British force is at pres­
ent stalled on its march to the relief
of General Townsend's beleaguered
army at Kut.
Italians Suffer Losses.
In Albania, the Austrians are evi­
dently having things their own way,
particularly as far south as Durazzo.
An official statement issued in Rome
admits the evacuation of Durazzo by
the Italians, who recently were re­
ported to have been defeated on the
outskirts of the city by the Austri­
ans.
The capture of 235 officers, 12,753
men, and 323 guns, in the operations
about Erzerum was announced in the
official Russian statement tonliiht.
The pursuit of the Turkish armies
continues, and the Russians have oc­
