WASHINGTON MAY
DISCUSS WHAT IS
AN ARMED CRAFT
Lansing: Indicates United State
May Take Up Question with
Germany if it is
Baised.
LESS EXCITEMENT AT CAPITOL
Leaders in Congress Apparently
willing to Await Outcome of
Diplomatic Exchanges.
PRESIDENT WILSON IS ITEM
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26. The
United States, Secretary Lansing In
dicated today, may discuss the ques
tion of what property may be re
garded as armament on a- merchant
chip, if the question is raised.
One of the entente allies, to which
Secretary Lansing suggested disarma
ment of merchant ships, replied to
day, but the nature of the reply or
the name of the government which
made It will not be disclosed until
all of the allies hare answered. The
Impression prevailed that it was not
Great Britain, but probably was
France or Italy.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. With
the apparent quieting down of the
situation in congress, the submarine
crisis shifts back to the negotiations
between Secretary Lansing and
Count Von Bernstorff.
Mr. Lansing said today there was
no intention of transferring the nego
tlatlons to Berlin to be conducted be-
een Ambassador Gerard and the
erlln foreign office, as was inti
mated' In dispatches published
abroad, and reiterated that the State
department had heard nothing more
from Germany on its request for a
declaration that the new submarine
campaign would not be conducted in
violation of previous assurances for
the safety of Americans traveling on
unresisting liners.
The situation In congress apparently is
belm held In check by the administra
tion leaders, while President Wilson re
mains firm in his determination to In
sist on the rights of Americans to travel
on ahlDi armed for defense only.
vrom German sour come suggestions
that the Teutonio goTemments were In
spired to issue their new notice by the
American circular note to the allied pow
ers proposing disarmament of merchant
ships, and the German bsllet is that the
allies will not accept the American sug
gestion.
From BrltlsH sources come the positive
statement that the British government
t least has not rejected the American
suggestion, but la consulting It allies.
The Issue Is complicated by the atti
tude of the Italian government and the
presence at New York of three -armed
Italian merchantmen.
Ice Goes Out of '
Platte at Fremont
: and Flood Subsides
FREMONT, Neb., Feb. . (Special Tel
egram.) Ice In the main channel of the
Platte went out early this morning and
the danger of flood la believed to be over.
Th river is over a foot lower than dur
ing the night, when it overflowed the
lowands in this vicinity. The ice from
the Loup, which broke up yesterday, was
the cause of the high water here.
Near Mercer the Union Paclfio tracks
were threatened when a gorge formed,
throwing the water cut, but the use of
several carloads of cinders and bags of
sand prevented a washout. There was
no delay to trains. The Burlington rail
road and the county bridge at Fremont
withstood the high water without any
damage.
The wagon road leading from the Fre
mont bridge to t'.e dyke, a half mile
north was covered by water during the
night to a depth of over a foot. When
It subsided several big cakes of Ice were
left on the roadway.
It was necessary
to remove them before traffic could be
resumed. There Is very little Ice In the
main channel of the river.

anyone about Mr. Brandeis' employment,
