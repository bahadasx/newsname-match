will be taking form within the very
near future,,
The work of clearing the 60-acre
factory site In South Grants Pass is
progressing as rapidly as men and
teams can accomplish It, portions of
the site ba.vlag.lail heavy growth

the quitting of work,rthe hoomlng
of blasting powder tells the story of
the blowing out of stumps and trees
too large for the teams or the 80
horse power tractor to pull. Exca

begin early in the week.
Geo; Austin, who waa in the val
ley during tho week, left Saturday
to return to Utah, but will return
lator in the season to offer export ad
vice in beet culture, and to watch
the progress of the work here. His
son, E. N. Austin, has returned to
Grants Pass after a few days In the
Medford district, where he attended
the meetings which his father ad
dressed. He says that the mooting
held at Central Point Thursday night
was especially successful, standing
room being at a premium, and the
Interested farmers staying till mid
night to listen to the talk and to ask
questions regarding beet culture.
Alex Nlibloy has also returned from
Medford, Messrs, Story-and Pottlnglll
being in charge of the work there at
this time. A mooting was held at
Medford Friday night, and while It
was not largely attended, much of
value will probably come from it. At
this meeting Mr. Austin renewed the
assurance that All the upper end of
the valloy had to do to got a factory
next season was to grow the beets,
The soil and cultural exports are
greatly ploaBod with the outlook In
the Rogue valley, finding here muoh
soil that is admirably adapted to the
culture of boots. The senior Austin
tated before leaving that he expected
that the record for high yield of
fceots per acre would foe taken by
this valley, as there were tracts here
that he had never soon equalled for
the growth of the vegotable. -

CRISIS 111 III THE

Washington, Feb. 26. With the
German submarine warfare on armed
enemy merchant ships scheduled to
start in four days. It appeared un
likely today that congress would in
terfere effectively before then In the
German-American diplomatic situa
tion. " '
A crisis In relations (between the
two countries, however, is Imminent.
Germany's reply to the American
refusal to acquiesce in the German
project waa expected momentarily,
and It was believed German Ambas
sador von Dernstorff would be ready
to present It to the state department
Monday
That the answer would be unsatis
factory was regarded by the admin
istration aa a foregone conclusion.
Moreover, despite rumors of a post
ponement of the warfare decree, offi
cials did pot believe Germany plans
any delay.
After two days of discord, con
gress prepared today to relax its agi
tation for a warning to Americans
to refrain from traveling on armed
mercnant ships of the belligerents.
Some "flare-ups" were still anti
cipated, but serious attom ptB to pass
over President Wilson's objections
any measures warning Americans to
keep off armed merchant ships had
been temporarily abandoned.
In tho senate the Gore warning re
solution had no chance of coming
up today because of the legislative
maneuver of taking a recess yester
day until today, instead of adjourn
ing as' customarily
As for the statements of Speaker
Champ Clark and Majority Leader
Kltchln that an "overwhelming ma
jority" of the house favors a warn
ing, prominent house members de
clared those views are mistaken.
'A group favoring a compromise
measure suggested that President
Wilson warn Americans from armed
belligerent ships, but declare thorn
within tholr rights if they violated
the warning. As a corollary to this
proposal, the administration would
be asked to warn Germany that It
had taken all possible steps to pro
tect citizens, but still would hold Ger
many to "strict accountability" if any
were injured or killed through Ger
man attacks.

Lid Is Kept Clamped Down,
ad Discussion Over the
Question cf Arced Her
chacteenFzils to f Materialize
Washington, Feb. 26. From one
of the allied nations America has
heard aa to her proposal that, for
the sake of humanity, armament be
removed from merchant ships. What
this reply stated, or from whence It
came, the administration would not
announce today.
It was, however, of such a nature
as to have no effect upon the Ameri
can difficulty with Germany over the
latter' decree of war upon armed
enemy merchant vessels.
Meantime, Washington was today
leas excited about the latter subject
than It had been for several days,
due largely to the administration's
restrictions upon congress.
Discussion of the decree and of
a warning to Americana to keep off
of armed belligerent ships waa kept
from the floors. Chairman 8tone, of
the senate foreign committee, kept
"on the lid" so tightly that even
local tills could not be Introduced,
lest they provoke discussion of the
International situation.
Secretary of State Lansing and
Chairman Flood, of the house for
eign committee, conferred over the
possibility of a compromise warning
measure, which Flood wishes to offer,
but neither would comment upon the
situation.
Officials were surprised that only
one allied reply came, as they had
expected a Joint answer.
Regardless of what this reply Is,
the government can not ask Austria
and Germany to postpone operation
of their decree, as this, it was ex
plained, would put the United .States
In the position of seeking postpone
ment of an act held to contravene in
ternational law.
On the other, hand, If the allies
unanimously agreed to the United
States disarmament proposal, Lans
ing might ask a postponement, since
Germany made It known she would
rescind the decree If the allies prom
ised the destred disarmament.

Berlin, Feb. 26 A great fleet of
Zeppelins flying to America and
bringing food back to Germany, is
a possibility, if this war lasts sev
eral years longer, an authority on
aeronautics declared today.
"Seems like a dream," he said,
"but a war that has seen submarines
go from Wllhelmshaven to Constant
tinople and Zeppelins and aeroplanes
play unexpected tricks, may Bee even
more .startling developments in, say,
three ot four years.
"The very fact that this pf&B(bH-

the realization here that this war be

decisive If not a battlo to exhaustion.
In this finish fight, Germany expects
to win, It necessary, by bringing into
play all the Inventive powers that
already have stood her In such good
stead."

Washington, Feb. 26. The yea-
son for administration opposition to
issuance of a warning to Americans
to keep off armed belligerent ships
was explained by a high state de
partment official today for the bene
fit of the public, at the request of the
United Press, fie said that follow
ing the Lusitania topedoing, Ger
many promised not to attack unarm
ed liners In the future without warn
ing to Insure the safety of passen
gers. Then before the informal
Lansing-Bernatorff conferences were
fairly started over demands for dis
avowal, admission of liability and
punishment of the commander, the
torpedoing of the Arabic occurred.
In settling the latter case, Ger
many promised not to attack any
liner without warning. After months
of Informal negotiations, Germany
phrased a final reply In . the Lusi
tania case, satisfactory to the ori
ginal American demands, hut before
the formal agreement was reached.
however, Germany issued her pro
clamation of war on armed enemy
merchant ships.
"Another reading ot the Arabic
promises showed that the decree waa
wholly Inconsistent with the settle
ment and nullified it. Again, If the
government were to warn citizens, it
would" place the situation In a posi
tion of nullifying and even repudi
ating the Lusltanla demands," said
the official. . , :

Paris,. Feb. 28. The fortress of
Douamont, taken by the Germans
earlier In the day, has been recap
tared by the French after a desperate
struggle, the war office announced
tonight. - Con tinned bloody fighting
around Verdun was reported.
London, Feb. 26 Advancing re
lentlessly along their path of blood,
the Germans, driving for the fortress
city of Verdun, have captured the
strong fortress of Douamont, fonr
miles northeast of Verdun, accord
ing . to a German official statement
today. .,'..'..: f "
The Paris war office did not con
firm this claim, however.
' It the German claim Is true, it
means that the first (breach has been
made la the Verdun torts, and indi
cates that the Teuton offensive now
seriously, threatens the French
stronghold. '
The reported capture Is believed
to have followed the collapse of the
French front from the Ridge Cote du
Polvre (Pepper heights) .through
Bezonvaux, , , ,
In view of the position ot Doua
mont, It Is also believed the whole
French force defending Verdun from
the north and northeast has been
backed Into the fortress under the
most terrible stroke dealt hy the
Germans since their offensive started
Cote du Polvre, key to the city's
northern defenses, had heen regarded
as Impregnable, even though assailed
by the enormous number of guns
the Germans had massed for their
drive. The latest Paris' statement
admitted
that German regiments
were assailing the French armored
trenches and redoubts there, though
It claimed these assaults had heen
halted. - '
I From Douamont, the German guns
can bear upon the forts De Vaur,
D Tavennes and De Belleville and
sweep the northern plain about the
aidered entirely too high, here.
positions the world has ever known.
Capture ot Douamont alone was
.accompanied by tremendous losses,
iTno olood of thousands of men mln-
1 gles with the snow of the region. ., I
Beyond doubt, the Germans have
centered all their resources on the
western front, on the Verdun drive,
hoping that, after taking it, they will
be able to make their way to Paris
and thus bring an early end to the
war.
French reports Indicate that the
Teutons have drawn on their Russian
fortifications to supply needed guns,
and that others, released through
Serbian Bucoesses, have been concen
trated In the Verdun region.
The enormity of German losses
already is considered proof that the
kaiser plans to bring France to her
knee's and to compel a peace.
The French have ibeen thrown
back nearly four miles along the
eight-mile front before the city, and,
acoordlng to Berlin, the Teutons are
still progressing.
While the offensive against the
French proceeds, the English to the
north are not Inactive. The British
