The First Shock.
The first Job the Brooklyn Republi
cans tried to land was that of chairman
of the Slate Hospital Commission. This
place was held by the late. William H.
Friday and It was presumed another
Brookljnlte would be named in his
place. When names wero sent to Oov.
Whitman with the Brooklyn Indorse
ment the Kings leaders received their
first shock on being informed this par
ticular piece of patronage would go to
u county outside of Brooklyn. New
York finally landed it. much to the dis
pleasure of the Republicans of the sis
ter boiousti.
It was about this time that Oov.
Whitman was scouting around for sym
pathizer for his boom for the Presi
dency. If lie had one big county of the
State Indorse hlin as a favorite son he
figured It would go a greit way In help
Ing the progress of his boom. The
Brooklyn Republicans were advised If
they took the InitiatKe In this direction
they would have no le.iMUi to regiet
their action. Consequently a meeting
of the county committee was called and
with a great hurrah the Brooklyn Re
publicans went on recoid as lialorslng
Whitman for President.

Ajmtmuiam, via London, Feb. "i.
Tho l-'iinikfurtcr .cltnnii publishes the
views nt n high German naval oflieer on
submarine warf.ue. He says:
"The view Is shared by the majority
of Girm.in naval oltkers that a complete
bleach between Germany and America
would be conducive to a far earlier ami
victorious termination of thu war, but
only on condition that Germany derived
all the re-ultM logically arising from
such a breach,
"As S"Oti us wo nenl have no more
consideration for the Culled States we
can wage naval warfare with the same
ruthlessiiesN as the British hitherto have
done. We could Immediately declare all
Great Britain and Ireland blockaded, an
nounce that every ship under whatever
Hag tried to inter n British harbor
would on entering the war zone lie re
garded as a blockade runner mid would
be destroyed without warning so as to
eliminate tho hitherto existing tricks,
especially lis past exierlence shows that
every me rchant vessel Is armed."
In reply to tho contention that tin)
sinking of neutral merchant ships with
out warning would piovuke neutral In
dignation the olllctr said:
"The Indignation of neutrals In a mat
ter that touches our existence can In
llnrnce us as little nt. It Influences at
present the British, who unhindered
constantly trample on the rights of neu
trals." Tho eifllcer thinks that such a policy
would lead to the starvation of Great
Britain and then tu her submission and
then niltomiitlcallv to the submission
of RiiMda and France. America would
then be Isolated and would have lo sub
mit liei'iiuse Germany, having oblaluil
from her other beaten opponents the
transfer to Germany of all their great
battleships and submarines, would be
seven times stronger on sea than
America. America then would lie
beaten and would have to surrender all
the German merchant ships which she
has seized and also pay nil the war
costs of the Central Poweis and their
allies.

The cllinav of thu Impending ar was
reached In the contest for the four delc-
Kaie at large to tiie national convention
at Chicago. Itiooklyn presented the name
of William Herri, Regent of the State of
New York and owner of the Brooklyn
MMMifurii t'nfo it, for one of the "Big
Four." It was lonceded that Ciov.
Whitman was In favor of Mr. Herri Im
mediately after Mr. Herri had dined with
the Governor at the executive Mansion, i
On the day of the convention word
reached New York from Albany that
Gov. Whitman had chnnged his mind
atiout supporting Mr, Ben I nnd had
swung to David Jayne Hill of Ro-liester
because Boss Aldridge of Monroe county,
nn ally of Whitman, wanted It. The
nomination committee of the convention,
lifter being In a deadlock between Herri
and Hill lor three hours, finally com
promised on Senator Klon R. Brown of
Jelferson county.
The defeat of Mr. Herri angered the
Brooklyn delegates greatly. They at
tributed this directly to the Governor

The reason for this action did not be
come apparent at the time. Now It has
become clear to the Republicans gen

Hervey and Whitney the motion with
drawing the losolutlon will bo carried.
