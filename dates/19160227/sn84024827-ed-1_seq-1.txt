Way to Reopen Mines Near
Big Sonora Copper Camp.
world, aq a whole, la a visitor in' the
Warren District for several days.
Chariot arrived in Bisbee yesterday
from New York and will leave tomor
row for Cananea.
The visitor is a Frenchman by birth
but has been a naturalized American
citizen for over twenty years and has
had mining Interests in the state of
Sonora for the past sixteen years.
He represents capital from France,
England and Russia, as well as the
United States. '
He is on his way to Cananea to re
open the property of the Cananea
Eastern, located within a few miles
of the famous copper camp. The
mine will be put in active operation
as soon as possible and later other
property, supervised by Chariot, will
also be opened again.
In speaking of the copper situation.
Chariot, who has been residing in
New York for. many years and) con
stantly since the revolution started in
Mexico, and who has kept in . touch
with the recent international situa-
tion, says:
I can see nothing but good in the
future. I am an optimistic by nature
and the present situation, as it ef
fects the great copper producing in
terests of America, will make for
good in my opinion. Even should the
war terminate at an early date, I feel
the demand for the red metal will con
tinue very strong for years to come.
Though it is repetition I feel that
England must rebuild and a i great
part of ' that reconstruction will be
made with copper. The greater part
of the metal must come from America
and a big part of that supply from
the Southwest.
"Though the Southwest is now fam
ous for its great copper mines, locat
ed in Bisbee, Canaiea, Nacozari and
a few other points. I think the future
will see other great properties devel
oped. There are ' several in the
embryo in and near Cananea district
at the present time. Bisbee is the
i first and pioneer and will always
take lt fir8t bid for the f
i no uniiiticfr ui n wunu ui vuyiK-r.
Chariot, though French by nativity,
refuses to talk war to any great ex
tent. He declares he. is an American
and as. an American is satisfied, with
America in evry way. He expects
to remain in Cananea several ' weeks
and then return to his hearqnaiters
and office in New York.

Meetings of the Two Parties,
in June, Are Harpooned by
the Newspaper Men of the
Nation's Capital.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. The Grid
iron Club tonight as its second dinner
cf the winter, projected itself into the
i
convention activities of next June and i
helped a distinguished party of presi
dential makers and candidates board
trains for Chicago and St. Louis to
meet the fates awaiting them theie.
In a make-believe railway station the
actor members o fthe club satireized
the foibles of sjme of their guests and
some well-known men who were not
present.
President Wilson was among those
who looked on and he may have Re
ceived an intimation of the opposition
he will meet later in the war. Vice i
President Marshall, the Secretaries of
State, Navy and Interior, the Brazilian
Ambassador, the Chinese and Bolivian
ministers, several members of the
Senate and House, officers of the ar
my and navy, and a number of the
most notable figures in the nation's
financial and industrial life were pres
ent. The most ambitious of several
sketches presented by the club was
the political one. Scrambles to make
trains, strange travelling companions,
and ticket complexities that confound
ed the railway gatemen offered extra
ordinary onoortunities for fun-making.
Passing through the Chicago gate
were regular and progressive Repub
licans, characters representing former
Senators Burton and Beveridge. for
mer Vicp President Fairbanks, Sena
tors Sherman, Borah, Cummins. Week
and Penrose, Representatives Cannon,
former President Roosevelt, William
Barnes end George W. Perkins of New
York. Through the St. Louis gate
passed Secretary McAdoo, Postmaster
General Burleson. Charles F. Murphy
of New York and William Jennings
Bryan.
The first passenger to reach the C
cago train was recognized by one
the two gatemen as Senator Burton.
Nervous and fussed, he inquired if he
were too late and appeared greatly re
lieved when told that he was "leading
the parade."
You won't be too late till yon get
to Chicago," he was informed as the
gateman punched his ticket.
Next came a passenger for St. Louis
who was hailed as Secretary McAdoo.
He produced a weird looking ticket.!
finally recognized as mileage, which
the gateman examined laboriously.
Muttering that it seemed as complicat
ed as the shipping bill, the gatempn
asked if a mistake hadn't been made.
Its intricacies were explained by meth
ods of addition., and subtraction, and
the passenger passed, through grinning.
The gateman, recovering, remarked to
his pal: "That wasn't no railroad tic
ket: that was today's treasury state
ment." Among the next batch of passengers
was a tall, heavy-Set man, carrying a
broken plank under his arm, who tried
to crowd through the St. Louis gate
way. Hey, Mr. Speaker." expostulated
the gateman, "this ticket ain't no good
It reads for Baltimore. And it's four
years old."
I knew It!" shouted the passenger,
who reen"oled Champ Clark. "Still
Hearst told me to try to work it off.

The SDeaker finallv got through on
"Missouri mileage" but the plank be
came wedged in the gateway. As he
tried to disencaire It. he explained that!
it "came out of the Baltimore cyclone"
and was tliP last surviving bit of the
one-term plank. They asked him what
eood it was, and he replied that he
was "merely following T. R's advice
'Learn to swim, but always carry a life

nervous, was closelv followed by Sen
