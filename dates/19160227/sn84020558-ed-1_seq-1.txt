WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. The Grid-
iron club tonight at
its second dinner !
of the winter, projected itself into the
i onvention activities of next June and
helped a distinguished party of presi
dential makers and candidates hoyd
trains for Chicago and St. Louis to
in. et the fates awaiting them there.
In a nifke-helie e railway station the
actor-members of (lie club satirized the
foibles of some of their guests and some.
well-known men who were not present.
President Wilson was emong thos-
v. ho looked on, and he may have re- .
reived an intimation of the opposition j
he will meet later in the year. Vice ;
President -Marshall, the secretaries of!
state, navy and int :Hor, the Brazilian j
ambassador the Chinese and Bolivian
ministers, several members of the sen- j
ate and house, officers of the army and
navy, anil a number or the most nota
ble figures in the nation's financial and
industrial life were present.
The new ly elected president of the I
club, Louis W. St raver of the pi'.tslmrg j
liispatch, -vas inaugurated with a hti- j
morons skit in which all membeis par- :
ticlpated. variously attired to represent .
the old guard, the regular army re
serve, the continental army, the gov-
eminent merchant marine, progressive i
parts' and war revenue tax collectors. !
The most ambitious of several
sketches presented by the rluh was the '
political one. Scrambles to make trains,
strange travelling companions, and .
ticket complexities that confounded the ;
railway gatemen offered extraordinary j
oppoittmities lor f tin-making. Passing j
through the Chicago gate were regular
end progressive republicans, characters i
representing former Senators Burton
and Beveridge, former Vice President
Fairbanks, Senators Sherman, P.orah,
Cummins, Weeks and Penrose. Repre
sentative Cannon, former President
Roosevelt, William Barnes and George
W. Perkins, of New York. Through
the St. l.ouis gate passed Sec-etary
McAdoo. Postmaster General Rurleson,
Charles F. Murphy of New York and
William Jennings Bryan.
The first passenger to reach the Chi
cago "rain v as recognized by one of the
two gatemen as Senator liurton. Nerv
ous and fussed,' he inquired if he were
too late and appeared" greatly relieved
when told that he wrs -leading the
parade."
' You won't be too late till von get
to Chicago," he was informed as the
gateman punched his ticket.
Next came a passenger for St. Louis,
who was hailed as Secretary McAdoo.
He produced a weird looking ticket,
finally recognized as mileage, which the
gateman examined laboriously. Mut
tering that it seemed "as complicated
as the shipping hill," the gateman
asked if a mistake hadn't been made.
Us intricacies were explained by meth
ods of addition and substraction, and
the passenger passed through grinning.
The gateman, recovering, remarked to
his pal: "Thai, wasn't no railroad
ticket: that was today's treasury state
ment." Among the next hatch of passengers
was a tall, heavy-set man, carrying a
broken plank ender his arm, who tried

I Republican A. P. Leased Wire
The French war office in its lat
est official statement described the
battle around Fort Oouaumont,
one of the out.ying forts of Ver
dun, as desperate, but makes no
actual admission of the capture of
the fort by the Germans, claimed in
the official communication issued
at. Berlin.
Fort Oouaumont, says the French
statement, is an advance element
of the old defense organization of
the old Verdun fortress, ad goes
on to say that the position captured
Saturday morning by the Germans
after several fruitless assaults was
reached again by French troops,
who succeeded in advancing beyond
that point and have maintained
their ground. The position referred
to is not clearly defined
Heavy bombardments by the
Germans to the oast and west of
the Meuse were met by vigorous
counter attacks, and the French
have resisted the attempts of the
Germans to capture Champneuville
and La Cote De Poivre (Pepper
Hill), two positions of strategic
importance.
Late dispatches from Parts say
that utmost confidence is felt there
in the abdity of the French troops
to withstand the German assaults
and in some quarters a continua
tion of the battle centering around
Verdun for the next two weeks is
looked for. !
Tin- crovn princt's armies engaged
in the terrific battle have had their
way blast -d for them, according to
correspondents near the scene, by what '
is said to be the greatest concentration
of artillery fire, known to 1 1st ry. 1

mans and Aosirians, brought from the '
Serbian and Russian fronts, have
played an important part. i

though it was admitted that a posi

who for several days have agitated
passage of a resolution warning Amer-
i icans not to travel- armed ships,
seemed convinced tonight that no such
mca-Mirr could be put through at pres
ent. Senator Gore, w'ho has sucl'i a res
olution pemliuii, issued a statement
saving that while he still favored a i
warning he believed the objects sought
by his resolution already hail been ac
complished through public discussion.
j Representative McLemoiv, whose
i warning resolution has been kept from

said he was content to wait until the
I president ami Secretary Lansing had
I opportunity to try out their policy of
j asserting determinedly the riht of
I travel on ships bearing arms.
Administration officials still were
i awaiting the receipt of the appendices
i to the latest German memora!!duin on
i the subject which contained what ii al
j h-ged to be a copy of confidential in-
struotions given to llritsh sea captains,
j If this document contains what the
i German government claims, it is s.i.o
I to he probable inquiries may be ad
dressed to Ireat J'.ritain on the sub
ject. The llritish government some
time assured the Fnited Stales
that its merchant ships would not op
erate offensively.
Germany in its memorandum gives
as one of the cardinal reasons for its
determination to sink armed merchant
ships of her enemies without warning
1 ....... . . ,
the fact that German submarines havo
j been fired upon repeatedly by merchant
men which apparently were engaged '
i in peaceful pursuits of c immerce.
A high oiiicial ot the state deparl
j ment questioned about this contention,
gave it as his opinion that there might
! ill certain cases be justification for one
(gelligerent committing acts in retalia-
tion for violations of international law
committed by an enemy. It was made
plain that the department will not make
any decision in this Connection until it
has had opportunity to carefully in
spect the appendices to the German
memorandum.
It also was indicated at the state de
partment today that Germany lie re
cent acts had shown a disposition to
change her original position in regard
to the right of merchant ships to carry
defensive armament. Originally the
Berlin government denied that it was
legal for merchant ships to arm at all.
Now some officials here consider that
Germany is willing to admit that arm
ament is legal if purely defensive, in
other words, it is believed Hie German
government actually is attempting to
change the rules rather than" the law.
Should the subject be opened up for
i discussion the state department mav.
it was said, be willing to admit that
there should be some regulation regard
