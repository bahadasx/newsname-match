I. S. Mullen, president of the
Ciianibcr of Commerce, ..pent all of
Friday with various property owners
v ho own Main street property, in an
efiort to net several sites where :i
ho'el might be erected, in the event
capital can be interested, and lie sla
ted yesterday morning that there is
i general disposition on the part
most of them to be liberal in l heir cl.
nrmds, realizing that a big hotel will
be a bi:,' asset to the city, while others
lie staled, were inclined to want more
than the property is really worth
tninking it was a good time to "put
on the squeeze
Mr. Mullen stated that one thing is
cc tain, that the hotel committee Is
not going to stand for a "holdup."
If t he property they finally decided
upon was boosted beyond reason,
I. ley would decide upon some other
site, and there are several that can
hr purchased, and all in good loca
I ons, at a figure commensurate with
their worth.
I). A. Simpson left for Tulsa Friday
afternoon and while there lie will
talk the hotel matter over with sev
eral wealthy persons who have made
inquiries about a big hotel here, and
who are evidently interested. Mr. Simp
son has all figures, plans and loca
tions ready to present to these par
ties, and also sho wthem what Ard-
n. r re needs in the way of a hotel.
Joe iiuckins, who was here a few
et.js ago, sounded the rigid chord
when he advocated a hotel of not less
than 12j rooms, and this suggestion
seems to meet with the hearty ap
proval of all who are interested in
I the hotel proposition.
J. H. Sharp, millionaire oil operator,
was in the city yesterday In confer
ence with President Mullen of the
chamber of commerce relative to a

I'rof. A. S. Faulkner, president of

ed tin address to the Carter count v
teachers' organization nn r.-t.i.v. i..
which was truly remarkable and prac
tical.
Speaking of t lie present unrest, he
showed that such a condition was his
toiically characteristic of changing
epochs. The time when men were
blindly partisan and loval to nolitlcal
or religious organizations and tradi
tions is passing.
Men are measuring their sinnm-i

more and more.
This, again, Is characteristic of
.....aging epoch. These epochs, how.
ever, are not sharply marked in i l).-ir
boundaries. One does not K t ,,j
fit night in one epoch and awake next
day in another epoch. Epochs .ner
lap and merge into each other. Tl..'
changes are gradual.
This unrest and change is present
in educatiim as in oilier social activi
ties, and to education is heini? nut the
icul tests of results. . presen' edu
cation is yoing ov. r the past know
ledge and remodeling and adapting
it to meet the new needs arising from
new cond. Hons.
Two contending ideas are nctive
mi educai.ic.il.-the cultural and the so-
rational or nrac-iie..,!
i
One theory contends Unit tlu nil
ture of the mind, without direcf p f
erence to I he ability as a breadwinrei
or producer, is the object of .dura

! to the ages when the free men were
given a classical education or -gainst
the practical education r.en to Un
shoes as producers. Since the slaves
did all tip. producing, the only object
of education in the Grecian age fr
tne fteeni.iii was for cu!ti.r effert.
The ocational or praclic: I educa

F'resident Faulkner as.-erl-i tha'
social cl-velopnient had obliterated
