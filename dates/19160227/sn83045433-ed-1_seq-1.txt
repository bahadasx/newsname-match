Against Borland Plan
By JOSMEP P. ANNIN.
The real strength of the opposition to
the Borland eight-hour rider--o-called
began to manifest itself yesterday in the
House. Representative Gallivan, of Mae
saehusetts. Democrate member of the ap
propriations conmnittee, obtaned unani
mous consent to file a minority report on
the legislative bill.
Representative Gallivan was absent

ea.a .a --- -- ~ag -e-- yese
day that he proposes to fight twrider to
the "ilt ditch.
Despite the eoendence with which
friends of the rider declare that a point
of order will not lie against it. partia
mentarians in the House yesterday felt
that its fate under the rules was un
questionable, to say the least, Repre
sentative Crtsp, of Georgia, will be called
upon to rule on the point of order in
volved, Mr. Crisp having been selected
by the Speaker to preside over the House
during consideration of the bill In com
soittes of the whole.
New legislation is prohibited on appro
priatlon bills except when the legislation
cames within the purview of the so
called Holman rule. The Holman rule
provides that any member may offer an
namament involving new legislation on
an appropriation bill when on its face
the legislation proposed will reduce the
number of offices or the, total of appre
priations carried in the bill, and that leg
islation reported by a committee is in
order when it would serve to reduce the
expeMitures of the government.
4kntvaa UMreS Facts.
Several of the leading parliamentarIans
In the House yesterday held that the
above reading of the law presupposes
that the ligfslation proposed shall have
been reperted out by a legislative com
mittee and that the Borland amendment.
never having been passed upon by a leg
islative coamittee, would not come within
this interpretation.
Representative Gallivan pulled the
moask from the argument in favor of the
proposal yesterday when he showed that
far from being a proposal for an eight
hour law, the Borland rider seeks to
saddle on government employes a work
ing day of mn- ' n eight hours.
Mr. Galivan sai4d:
-The .. r Ia not legislation
In favor of an eig;ht-hour day. It is legis
lation directly opposed to the principle
and practice of an eight-hour day. The
principle of eight-hour legislation and the
practice of its enforcement is that the
employe shall not work more than eight
hours. The letter of the Borland pro
vision and the spirit is that the employe
shall not work less than eight hours.
"Mr. Borland has been quoted as say

will equals. working conditions among

At a wecial meeting of the board of
governors of the association yesterday
afternoon that body went on record
against the eight-hour stipulations and
instructed Its officials to deliver its reso
lutions to members of Congress tomer
row.
The passage of this measure would
necesaitste a rearrangement of all Wash.
Ington stores, in the view of the govern
ora of the retailers' association. Under
the law of the District no woman can be
employed for longer than eight hours.
Department store men asserted that with
this rider as a law, they must shift their
workers Into two tricks or deprive the
government clerks of the opportunity of
mnaking their purchases.
Would Work Hardships.
M: A. Leese. vice president of the mer
chants' organization, who presided in the
absence from the city of President R. P.
Andrews. pointed out to the governors
that the law would work innumerable
hardshivs upon the government clerks.
One of these, he said, would be upon
those who are buying their homes in
Virginia. Maryland or - portions of the
District removed from the street car
lines, and who would be'forced'to work
until so late that It would become a hard
ship upon them to get home In time for
the evening meal.
It was also brought out that many
clerks now work until 6 and 7 o'clock
h the evening, some of them to a later
time, so that this measure will be, in
effect, a slap In the face for those who
do not "watch the clock," but give their
undivided attention to the duties involv.
ing upon them.
Other organisations of business men
will take up this question at meetings
to be held tomorrow. The executive com
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce will
meet tomorrow noon to consider similar
action to that taken yesterday by the
merehants. and the executive committee
of the Board of Trade may adopt its pro
test at the meeting to be held in the
board rooms at 1 o'clock tomorrow.

For that reason there was a well da
fined report in Washington last night
that the administration leaders may go
so far tomorrow as to force a vote en
one of the pending resolutions for the
purpose of defeating it and thus Im
pressing Germany with the idea that the
President has Congress behind him.
The repdrt gained headway when press
dispatches reaching here yesterday
from Berlin reorted a feeling in Ger
many that the President would not dare
force the Issue over the Kaiser new
submarine policy in view of the revolt
In Congress.
At the same time, however, the Preel
dent's leaders in Congress yesterday did
not relax their vigilance.
Try to Cheek Reeurrenee.
Despite the present inactivity of the re
volters against the President's foreign
policy, Administration leaders are leav
ing no stone unturned to prevent a re
currence of the trouble. In conformity
with suggestions by the Presidept's ad
visers they are doing a lot of missionary
work in an endeavor to convince the bel
ligerents that action by the House on a
diplomatic question might seriously em
barass the United States in Its interna
tional relations. Among those who ae
assisting in this work is Representative
Adamson, of Georgia. a Demnocratte
leader. Mr. Adameo'n announced yester
day:
"In case any resolution cones up in the
House afecting the PreeldenV manage
mnent of foreign affairs I will ofer the
following resolution, and all the Georgia
members will support it."
The resolution reads:
"While it Is.obviously foolish and reck
less, showing criminal disregard of the
rights. duties and obligations and peace
able relations of their government for
American citizens to take passage on the
ships of any of the belligerent nations
engaged In the present universal war,
yet we have unbounded confdence in the
ability.and integrity of the President of
the United States, whose constitutional
duty is to tondaet,all diplomatic business

It is understood the signals were found

had completed his investigation of the
wreck and was- at work on his findings.
It i9 understood the coroner is strongly
Impressed b,, the theory.of the possibility
of Engineer Curtis having died at the

The theory is borne out by the two
facts. The signals were set against the

London, Feb. 26.-The develop
ments of the great German oi
fensive dominate the-news, col
umns in all the papers which
eagerly weigh the possibilities of
ultimate re-eess for the Germans.
Thillebe 6ays:
"The Germans are endeavoring
to repeat at Verdun the tactics
czrried out with such success by
Von Nlackensin last spring on the
Dunajec. The Germans then con
centrated on a short front huge
numbers of men and guns and
just blasted their way through.
The rcult was the Russian re
treat.
"This method necessitates simup
ly a frightful loss of life, the
attacking troops being indeed
used as so much cannon fodder."
The Evening Newss, alluding to
the fall of Fort Douaumont,
says:
"The ncws is unpleasant and
unexpected. The famous Bran
denburg corps ranks with the
Prussian guard in driving force
and is one of the Kaiser's dear
est favorites.'
The Westminster Gazette men
tions that the crown prince'
army was strengthened by five
corps for the great effort again'
Verdun and by new troops drawn
from the Russian front.
"This fact," it goes on, "bring'
home the necessity the Germans
are under to make their attack
now if they wish to decide mat
ters in the west before spring
makes it possible for Russia to
nmove in full strength in the east.
If the blow fails, Germany will
be so much less able to hold up
the weight of the Russians."
The Evening Standard says:
"France is fighting grimly with
a full knowledge of the conse
quences of failure and w ith no
enervating optimism, such as has
been the bane of this country.
"Tle French think a, we tink
that if 4he attempt fails, that fail
ure will be decisive. but they arc
wisely prepared for the w orst.
The Pall Mall Gazette says:
"It is within the power of any
belligerent to cffect gains of
ground by paying a disproportion-'
ate price. Neither France nor her
allies will pay undue significance
to the fact that the invader is
(orcing his way nearer Verde'n,
but the violence of the onslaughit
might almost suggest that Ger
many will pay anything for a
resounding achievement."
