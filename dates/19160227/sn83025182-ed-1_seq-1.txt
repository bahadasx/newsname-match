Without Aid of CongMM,
[United Press Leaded Wire gervlos.]
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26.—President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing to
night again took the helm in the con
troversy with Germany ovw subma
rine warfare.
For nearly a week, congMM bas
flared into a turmoil of excitement
over the Question of whether Ameri
can citizens should be warned off an

house quit business for the day, that
there would be no legislative interfer
ence for the time being at least, with
the handling of the situation, by the
white house and the state depart
ment
Congressional as well as adminis
trative offloiaJs were agreed that the
turning back of the problem to Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
was significant In that it tended to
smother the hope, reported in dis
patches today from Berlin that con
gress would force the president to
settle the armed merchantmen issue
in a way acceptable to the oentral
powers.
Coincident with the shift of interest
to the state depm-tment. Secretary
Lanstag announced receipt of a re
ply from one of the entente powers
to his suggestion for a modus vivendi
in the armed merchantmen question.
Officials frankly expressed surprise
that all tho replies did not come to
gether, stnoe it was believed the al
lies were jointly considering the pro
posals and would respond Jointly.
'1 no fact that th4s inference was in
correct, led officials to forecast a dif
ference of opinion among the allies
regarding the proposals.
Another important development was
the dispatching by cable to Atnbassa
I dor Gerard of the president's letter
I to Senator Stone, announcing the lat
ter's determination to oppose any act
that might tend to abridge the rights
of American citizens on the high seas.
Tno letter was sent to allav what
seemed to be growing belief through
out the central empires that this
count.i-y was inclined to regard the
March 1 submarine decrees of the
teutonic powers not only as reason
able to a degree, but as justifiable.
Despite the seeming certainty that
the United States will hold to Its at
titude of being irrevocably opposed
to any act by any belligerent that
does not adhere strictly to the let
ter of international law, state depart
I ment officials tonight indicated a pos
slble avenue of compromise that
I might eliminate chances of a diplo
I matlc collision on the point of armed
merchantmen.
The possibility rested on the ecm

Berlin and here is that the alleged sec

Officials refused to speculate on
this point, but was explained biy a
prominent international lawyer that
an original copy of these secret or

must be no doubt, however, this law

membered that German officials here
claim they took a copy of one of these
