Burton Holmes Travelogues and the :
idea of forming Travel Clubs to read j
and study thee correctly. He writes: '
"Before purchasing the TRAVE
LOGUES I convinced myself of their
several points of merit.
First, I found tbat they are told and
illustrated in such a,i interesting style
as to invite one to take them from the
shelves in the evening after a day of
mental strain: Then, I proved that
tbey could be'relied upon for facts and
are so true to the local coloring, or at
mosphere, of each country tbat one en-
joys anew tbe keen pleasure he experi -
enced when he first traveled abroad.
But tbeir greatest MERIT lies in the
author's abili'y to make the reader
see tbe place be has NEVER visited
a nd for that reason tbey are of real '
educational value.
