Fort Joffre's Men Wrest It Back

London. Feb. 2o\?Fort DouaumorU, four miles northeast
of Vertun, captured by the Germans this morning, uas Stem
back by the French this afternoon. The battle for the strong?
hold was the fiercest that has been fought since the Crown
Prince launched his drive at Verdun, last Tuesday.
Early in the day the Brandenburg regiments, under the
eye of their Emperor, began the assault. Under fire of the
guns on the west bank of the Meuse and shelled by the heavy
artillery of the fort, they swept acros.s the open plain. The
heavily massed troops fell in rows under the fierce French fire,
but the advance did not halt. In a final fierce effort they reached
the crest and took the fort. They had made the first breach in
the cordon of protecting forts.
