Will Organize
Next Thursday
Board of Trade Is Rescued from
l- Dormant State. ,
The lunch and smoker given by our
business men as a Hoard of Trade last
Wednesday evening at the Russell
House, proved to be far more reaching
in the effort to get our business men
together than was anticipated. A rep
' resentative gathering oT nearly one
hundred of our leading citizens answer
ed the call, and every man present
evinced a keen interest in the develop
ing of our community.
Following an appetizing supper made
pleasing by the delightful music of
Metropole Orchestra, cigars were lit
and an informal talkfest was held pre
sided over by Chairman W. C. Spring.
Secretary R. A. Brintnall gave a brief
history of the East Jordan Board of
Trade citing its successes and failures,
and giving a brief financial statement
showing a balance in the treasury.
Following this addresses were given
v by Att'y D. L. Wilson, Hon. II. I. Mc
f!illan, R. O. Bisbee, C. S. Abbott of
V (Detroit, W. P. Porter, W. L. Peck,
y "Mayor Cross and, for the farmers J.
n Chew.
The consensus of opinion seemed
favorable to a reorganization of the
Board of Trade, and it was agreed that
a meeting to organize should be held
at the Armory next Thursday evening,
March lGth, commencing at 8:30. This
will be a business meeting in its true
sense, and everyone is urged to be
present at this time to help in perfect
ing the organization and mapping out
a campaign.
It was also suggested that the Retail
Merchants Ass'n also be reorganized
and a meeting will be held for this pur
pose probably next Monday evening.
There is no question but what result
getting work can be accomplished by
the re-organizing of our Board of Trade
and the interest manifested at the
meeting of Wednesday night, is evi
dent that many things will be done to
ward the developing of our resources
in the coming year.
'OBSERVER" URGES
MORE FRIENDLINESS
By (Observer)
When kind words and pleasant
smiles do so much good, yet cost noth
ing, why don't, we turn more of them
loose? Why will we harbor a pent-up,
grouchy feeling when we, ourselves,
can feel a buoyant spirit kicking our in
sides to get out, and when we know
we would feel better if we let it out
, at least to graze around nearby?
v Someone has said: "There's so much
'good in the worst of us, and so much
bad in the best of us that it little be
hooves any of us to talk about the rest
of us."
That fellow was right. No one is
wholly bad. No one is hoplessly grou
chyor even melancholly. The trouble
with us is we're so wrapped up in our
selves, in our own thoughts, that we
fail to consider anyone else. The
average person is not only friendly,
but is really sympathetic when he rea
lizes his friendship or sympathy is
needed. Let death visit a home, and
the survivors discover warm hearts in
souls they had always thought frigid.
Let fire wipe out a family's dwelling
and it is at once the reccipient of favors
it had never believed possible.
But why do we wait for misfortune
to overtake our acquaintances before
we consider them? Oftimes there are
sorrowful and oppressed hearts in our
' midst of which we do not know. Kind
words and smiles, if given freely, if
given always, will often strike in one
of these places, and the comfort it gives
is much. And too, the smiling face and
cheery disposition arc their own re
ward. Show me the man or woman
who smiles always and speaks kindly
and J will show you a person whose
frifds are numbered by the acquaint
ances he or she may have. The habit
is worth striving for.

EAST JORDAN AGRI
CULTURAL CLUB
About twenty students of the East
Jordan High School have just com
pleted the organization of a society to
be known as the East Jordan Agricul"
tural Club. Their purpose is primarily
to hold weekly meetings, at which pro
grams will be given along agricultural
lines. However, they intend to go
further. Plans are already under way,
to organize and carry out a township
field meet, and the club is also plan
ning to organize and foster Corn-Growing
and Garden Clubs among the grade
pupils of the neighboring rural schools,
as well as here in East Jordan.
BAD ROADS KILLED HER
A few years ago a beautiful woman
in the prime of life lay suffering upon
a sick bed in a rural community.
It was imperative that she have a
physician at once.
The hired man was dispatched for
one in haste. V
He made the best time possible, but
the roads were muddy, and bad, and
cut up, and traveling at best was very
slow.
He lost much time in going and the
physician was equally delayed in his
progress.
After many hours he finally reached
the side of the sufferer.
But death had beaten him for death
had no bad roads to cover.
Had the physician reached her a lit
tle sooner her life could have been
saved.
But he did his best and bad roads did
the rest.
Bad roads killed this woman.
And bad roads are killing others ev
ery day in like manner.
Now isn't this a compelling argument
in favor of better country roads?
Or is the lite of human being of less
value than the cost of a few dollars
spent in road improvement?
A member of your own family may
furnish the subject for the next story.

Our Firemen
To Dance
Annual Ball at Armory Next
Friday Evening.
The members of the East Jordan Fire
Department are making arrangements
for their annual ball to be given at the
Armory next Friday night St. Patricks
Day.
Members of the various committees
are at work on the arrangements and
there is no question but what a fine
time will be afforded all who attend.
The evenings bill will be one dollar and
will include a luncheon.
East Jordan Hose Co. No. 1, is one of
the best drilled and equipped volunteer
fire departments in the state. And
when it is considered that the members
only receive pay for tne hours that they
are actually fighting fire that the
hours devoted to practice is remunerative-
then the local organization
should receive the hearty support of
every citizen when they put on any
entertainment of public nature.
School Commissioner's Notes
Monday, March Gth, is the beginning
of "Tuberculosis Week" for the schools
of Michigan. Every teacher who did
not receive one of the state outlines for
the instruction of her pupils this week
may get one by applying at this office.
Every physiology class should be taught
tnese five lessons even if the instruc
tion is delayed.
The commissioner put in a very pro
fitable and enjoyable week in Detroit.
The N. E. A. was splendid, but the
victory of practice over theory was
later so completely demonstrated that it
was worth all the rest of the meeting
put together. It was a pleasure to
spend three hours in the W. S. Perry
School in Ann Arbor. Words cannot
do justice to the complete mastery of
teachers over their pupils, and of
pupils over their lessons. By thought
and by tholfght applied, which is
system, every teacher can solve every
problem that confronts her. Every
evil which the human mind can analize
it can also conquer. This school com
pletely demonstrated the mastery of
the human mind.
Claiborn County, Tennessee, has 102
rural schools. The first year the
standard school idea was introduced, 52
schools worked for and received their
"Standard School" plates. The next
year all the rest received them, and a
number received "Superior School"
plates. Think of it. Why, we've just
got to get there!
The commissioner was invited to a
party last week, a real live surprise
party. The ladies of the Deer Lake
Grange Aid planned it. The parents
and school board of the community
surprised the school and teacher, Miss
Johnson. They brought with them a
sack of candy for each boy and girl, a
flour sack full of popcorn, and scores
of apples There were songs and
speeches, and speeches and songs.
Then at the close, Mr. Terry Barber re
vised the grange yell for school pur
poses and we all yelled:
"Good, better, best! Never let her rest,
'Till our school is "Standard,"
Better than the rest!
1916 Digests and School Laws sent
out this week.
The Rag Doll Junior Seed Corn Tester
explained in leaflets and sent 'to all
schools that are desirous of the same.
So little corn on hand this year and so
much may be wasted in planting. So
much poor seed can be discovered in
the testing.
Teachers whose certificates are not
on file in this office are not qualified
in this county and caunot legally draw
public money. Teachers whose insti
tute fee is not paid should know that
their certificates are not on file.
The spring promotion tests for Char
levoix County will be in the hands of
teachers for April 27-28. They will be
based on the course of study and boys
and girls will do well to work hard to
make a good record for themselves and
for their school. .
No man is so strong or so great that
he is not afraid of somebody, and in
nine cases out of ten that somebody is
a woman. '
Never do anything disagreeable today
that you can just as well put off until 1
tomorrow. By that time you may not
have occasion to" do it.
Even if you have nothing to give the
poor but a crust of bread, make it pala
table by softening it with a little of the
milk of human kindness.
"BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"
TO BE SHOWN HERE
Auspices Company I Temple
Theatre March 29-30.
One of the biggest film productions
ever shown in the United States, has
been engaged by Company "I,!' and
will be exhibited at the Temple Theatre
the evenings of March 29-30. "The
Battle Cry of Peace'' has heretofore
been shown only in the larger cities of
the country, and Company "I" have
gone to considerable expense to bring
this to the people of East Jordan and
vicinity.
Below is given a brief synopsis of the
story.
SYNOPSIS
Hudson Maxim, international author
ity on arms and ammunition, delivers a
lecture graphically describing Americas
defenseless condition. John Harrison,
inspired by Maxim's disclosures and
realizing the awful consequences to
which our national unpreparedness
may lead, resolves to consecrate his
every effort to the cause of adequate
defense. He is engaged to Virginia
Vandergriff, whose father is an ad
vocate of national disarmament and
"Peace at any Price." John makes a
C4MMQT . avat v.aa
fruitless effort to show Vandergriff the
fallacy of his stand. Vandergriff's
friend, Emanon, ostensibly a peace
propagandist, but in reality a foreign
spy, is the head of a band of conspir
ators plotting the invasion of America.
The invaders approach New York. The
news reaches a huge peace meeting at
T J :im : i t A.t
niiiiu vuiiucigim is uspeaitur. in me i
midst of this meeting a shell crashes
through the walls of the building. The
battleships of the enemy, out of range !
of the guns of Forts Hamilton, Hancock
and Wadsworth, are able to bombard
New York.
Shells are devastating the buildings
in the downtown district. Homes are !
desecrated; citizens slain without
mercy. Terror reigns. i
John's mother and sister are killed. '
Vandergriff is shot in the street. . John
is bayoneted in defense of the " girl he .
loves. As a climax to the horror,
Virginia's mother, to avoid disgrace at
the hands of the enemy, kills her two
daughters and herself.
An allegorical masterpiece is shown
contrasting Columbia, crushed, bleed
ing and trampled upon by a merciless
foe with Columbia as she should be
proud, commanding, supreme.
"Yes, there shall be peace but
peace with plenty peace with honor."
ELBERT BEDE SAYS
Appointments and disappointments
go hand in hand.
A number of people in a large Ore
gon city have died from eating meet.
We, too, have been laid out by the
butcher's bill.
It must have seemed peculiar to Wil
son at the wedding to have to feel for
the time being that he was not the first
person in the land.
It is claimed that every part of a dog's
carcass is valuable. The dog may not
be the only being that gets better re
sults as a fertilizer.
It is stated on good authority that
twice as many crimes are committed by
unmarried men as by married ones. Of
course, when a man marries he has
done his worst.
A preacher says the women are tak
ing up the vices the men are discarding.
The ought to get into heaven with
little trouble if they adopt none but
those discarded by the men.
A New York doctor says that bald
headed men never go crazy. They in
dicate good sense and sound mind by
the very fact of having no hair for a
handhold in a family altercation.
"The man who labors with his hands
must be recognized as well as the man
who labors with his brain," says a
country editor. Possibly so, but jsn't
the editor to get any recognition what
ever. If some of the energy and money
that has been expended in getting to
the north and south poles had been ex
pended in getting people to the polls
on election day, we probably would
have profited more.

THE ROAD TO HELL
An old document issued by the school
board of Lancaster, Ohio, in 1828, and
brought to light by being recently pub
lished in "Railway Engineering,"
brings a broad smile to our faces as we
read it, but how many of us will make
application to our own time? Here it
is: "You are welcome to use the
schoolhouse to debate all proper ques
tions in, but such things as railroads
and telegraphs are impossibilities and
rank infidelities. There is nothing in
the word of God about them. If God
has designed that his intelligent crea
tures should travel at the frightful
speed of 15 miles an hour, by steam, he
would have clearly foretold through his
holy prophets. It is a device of Satan
to lead immoral souls down to hell."
Patents an Engagement Ring.
How to place an engagement ring on
the finger of a woman who had unusually
large knuckles .was the problem which,
until recently, bothered a California
ranchman and occupied many thought
laden days and restless nights. The
fingers were of normal size except just
at the joints, and hence a ring that
would go on 'was too large when in
position.
The subject was studied from every
conceivable angle, and the fingers
measured and remeasured and pressed
for hours, with the view of reducing
the obstruction, but with little effect.
At last, just as matters were assum
ing a desperate state the California
man invented a ring that could be tak
en apart and adjusted to the finger and
then fastened together with two minute
pins. A minature lock and key can be
used instead of the pins, in case there
should ever be danger of the ring be
ing tampered with. A patent for the
device has been issued by the United
States patent office, and Cupid is now
entitled to be ranked among the in
ventors. Bits of Information

President Wilson's decision to run

A Washington dispatch to the New
York "Evening Post" exults that the
report on Mexico which has been sent
to the Senate "is by no means as full
of dynamite for this administration as
the Republicans had hoped." The
dynamite, let us say, exists. It may be
kept in cold storage in the files of the
State Department for a time. But it is
bound to explode one of these days.
Concealment of facts never yet helped
an administration. -
The recent disgraceful scenes in the
(Democratic) legislature of Oklahoma
are the logical result of President Wil
son's pardon of two (Democratic) poli
ticians who were convicted for enfor
cing the "grandfather, clause" which
the Supreme Court has declared inva
lid. When a man who is sworn, as the
President is, to maintain the Constitu
tion, will pardon, for partisan reasons,
men who have violated the Constitu
tion, he passes the word to all the
thugs to get busy.
We have not always agreed with the
utterances of George W. Perkins in
matters political, but he surely strikes
a responsive chord in our nature when
he describes himself as believing in
Republicanism "of the. Abraham Lin
coln, Thomas B. Reed, James G. Blaine,
William McKinley" brand. Reflecting
upon the present manner of conducting
our foreign relations, we are inclined
to place our emphasis upon the "James
G. Blaine" portion of Mr. Perkin's
words.

It is said that a cat has nine lives

A Chicagoian says if we would take

And Along Came Ruth
"What In the world are you trying to
do, auntie?" asked Ruth, seeing her
aunt trying to stuff a rag- into a small
crack where the window was broken.
"Well. I'm trying to fix this crack,
can't you see?" answered the woman
plainly provoked.
"If I were you," answered Ruth," I
would merely dampen a piece of ad
hesive plaster and paste it along the
crack. That will keep out every bit of
wind, and will strengthen the glass,
too."
"Fine," exclaimed her aunt "Thati
just what I'll do." And she did.
