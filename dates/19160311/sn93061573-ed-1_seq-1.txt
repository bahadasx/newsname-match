.Indue I.eih Dissolves Injunction
Aliainsl Slicril)' Crumley mid
Orders Saloon Closed
The temporary injunction en join
ing Sheriff Crumley from closing
the K. .1. Walters saloon was disolv
ed by Judge Thus. 1 1. I.eih at a hear
ing before him at Union March
The Wallers saloon is now closed
and will remain so in Jls present
location. Mr. Walters intends to
re-open in a different location with
in .'in days, out side Ihe .'inn foot lim
it of a church. Following is a copy
of the Judges opinion which, in i
fact, is the order disolving the in- !
junction again! Sheriff Crumley: ;
"In The District Court of the Fijjhlh '
Judicial District of the Slate of
Xrw .Mexico Sitliuu W ithin and I
for the County of I'nion -
K. J. Wallers. IMahitill'.
vs. I
I. J. Crumley, acting SherilT of I'n
ion County, New Mexico, I icfendant.
"THIS CAISK is now before the
Court on the motion of the defend
ant lo dissolve the temporary in
junction issued herein during the
absence of the judge of this court
from the. Stale. A temporary or
der was issued restraining the de
fendant from attempting to close
a saloon operated by plaintiff in
block ta'iO or the town of Clayton,
New Mexico which Hie defendant
SherilT claims was being operated
illegally because within the distance
from a church prohibited by Sub
section 1H of Section yr(ii of the Cod
ification of the Laws of New Mexico
l;ii.-.
"The part of this sub-section
which is applicable to this case
reads as follows: "Hut no license
shall be granted for Ihe sale of
liipior within one block or square
of any church."
, "The saloon operated
plaiutilT is at the North
block loüo. The church
tion is on the north sidi
by the
edge of
in tpies
of block
loóO, some little distance from the
street. lllock KI.'jI is directly
north of Ior.ll. lllock toM together
with the street hcivvcc i it ami
block lor.0 measures :i.o feel. The
distance between the church an the
saloon in ipiestion in a direct line
is I'S.IC-III feet, These various
facts i:re before the court by stipu
lation. "It is the contention of the plain
tiff that when the law says that "no
license shall be granted for the sale
of liipior within one block or. situare
of any church" it. means that a li
cense could not he granted for Ihe
sale of li.pior at any point within
the particular block in which the
church in. ipiestion may be located.
That, in the case, before the Court,
as the church is located in block
lo.'il. no license could be granted
for the sale of liipior any where in
said block, but. that such license
could be granted in any other block,
no matter how close that would
bring a saloon to a church. With
this contention the Court cannot
agree.. If that be the law. (here
could be a row of churches on one
side of a narrow street, anil a row
of saloons on the other side, hut a
few feet apaft. We would have a
law so absurd as to prohibit, a sa
loon on one side of the church for
three hundred feet, with buildings
located between, and on the other
side of the chuccli to permit them
in I' within a few feet with the
intervening space ami open street.
Such cannot be a reasonable inter
pretation of the law.
"The Court construes the law he
fore it to mean that each church is
a center of a prohibition district,
whose railing is a distance of one
block or sipiare measured m a
straight line, ami that in comput
ing the length of such radius the
width of the sli I should be taken
into consideration. In reaching this
conclusión the Court is following
decisions rendered by the Courts of
other -dales where similar ipicstions
have arisen. A like ii:eslioii was
before the Supreme Court of l.uo
isiaua in Stale vs llerard. .'I Southern
iti.'l. When that Court was consid
ering a statute (,f (hat stall- which
prohibited the keeping of private
markets within a radius of six
squares of the public market in
New Orleans, the Court held that
Wlien the KeuMalure ,;sed urh
i:, iguale they had in view to li an
eijurl and uniform distance in or
der to ;oid any arbitrary discrim
ination, and intended that the dis
tance should embrace both the
leiiglh f Ihe squares and the width
of the .streets. The Court says.
"The i iii 1 1 1 i r- is therefore narrowed
down as to whether the width of
the streets is or not :o be included

C.ontiniied on Kilitorial I'age.1
