to John Bull.
OPPOSE BREAK WITH GERMANY
Hatred of England, love of Ire
land and opposition to war on Ger
many under any circumstances were
the high notes of the meeting of
1,800 Irish men and women in the
Hotel Astor Saturday. Billed as
the "Irish race convention" admis
sion was restricted to those who
are opposed to the conduct of the
Irish members of Parliament In
supporting England's course in the
war. Therefore those who went to
the Astor expecting friction were
disappointed.
At the evening session an iron
clad organization was worked out
under the tiame of the Friends of
Irish Freedom. The organization
plan, as outlined by a committee
headed by John T. Ryan, of Phila
delphia, provides for a national
committee of sixty members, an ex
ecutive committee of twelve mem
bers and biennial meetings. Any
person of Irish extraction who sym
pathizes with Ireland in her aspira
tions for independence is eligible to
membership. The objects, as set
forth, are to oncourage and assist
any movement for the national in
dependence of Ireland, to aid in the
industrial development of the coun
try and the revival df the language,
literature, music and culture of the
Gaels.
Justice John V. Goff was selected
as first President of, the organiza
tion. The following Vice Presidents
were named: Dr. Thomas Addis Em
met, Victor Herbort, O'Neill Ryan,
St. Louis; Monslgnor Henry A.
Brann, New York, and Monslgnor
Joseph D. Couglin, Philadelphia.
Thomas H. Kelly, of New York, was
elected Treasurer, and John .D.
Moore, of New York, Secretary
Justice Goff presented Mgr.
Henry A. Brann, who after deliver
ing tho greetings of Dr. Thomas
Addis Emmet, who was unable to
bo present, offered prayer. His of
fering was brief. "God, Eternal
Father; God save Ireland," he
prayed. "And," after a pause,
"punish her enemies."
Then "Tho Star Spangled Ban
ner" was sung, and JuBtlco Goff
named various committees. James
K. McGulre, one time Mayor of
Syracuse, moved the appointment of
a committee on credentials and was
appointed to tho Chairmanship;
Judge Martin Lawless, of Norfolk,
headed tho committee on rules;
John F. Ryan, of Buffalo, tho com
mittee on permanent organization,
and Joseph P. Quinu, of Lowell,
Mass., the press committee.
When Justice Goff called the af
ternoon Bosslon to order James K.
McGulro reported that 2,267 cre
dentials had been Issued, of which
number 1,836 had been presented.
Some of tho bearers, ho declared,
came from Nomo, Alaska; others
from Tampa, Fla.
The commltteo on permanent or
ganization reported this ticket: Per
manent Chairman, O'Neill Ryan, of
St. Louis; Vice Chairman, Dr.
Thomas Addis Emmet, of Now
York; John J. Fitzgerald, of Brook
lyn; Victor Herbert, Monslgnor
Henry A. Brann. Dr. Robert L.
Thompson, of Philadelphia: Josoph
P. Mooney. of Cleveland; Dr. "Will
lam Carroll, of Philadelphia; Judgo
Martin Lawless, of Norfolk, Va.;
Thomas H. McGinnls, of Philadel
phia, and Monslgnor Josoph P.
Coghlan. of Philadelphia: Secre
taries, John D. Moore, Philip J.
Sullivan. Patrick J. Griffin and
Alfred J. Talloy.
This out of the way, Mr. Ryan
began his address with a tribute to
the high character of those present,
and tho declaration that not even
In tho days when the Land League
was formed were conditions more
critical in Ireland. "On this eve of
wo know not what, when tho eyes
or all nations are turned on our
Capitol," he went on, "we come to
say this to the nation and to Wash
ington: We want not war. We say
It with the keenest appreciation of
the words 'tho honor and integrity
Of the United States.' Wo have al
ways defended Its integrity. We
have always stood foremost In "de
fence of Its honor. But with the
deepest appreciation of the feelings
and) the cause of these utterances
ye also say that this nation, having
passed tnrougn eigmeen mourns ol
cross-winds, and having weathered
the storms, ought not now upon a
less serious provocation than was
offered in May, 1015, throw down
the gauge of battle and engage In
war with the Central Powers."
That was the utterance that the
meeting; had beon waiting for.
Again and again Judge Ryan was
cheered.
"May God avert from us the
calamity and devastation of war,"
he continued. "We have not yet
eofcie to the parting of the ways.
We want bo entangling alliances,
and when the die shall have been
cast, if oast it be, we shall stand,
as we always have stood, behind
the Stars and Stripes." Mr. Ryan
denied that the people of Ireland
are loyal to the English crown,
quoting the London. Times to show
that enlistments are small.
foaslfnor Coghlan, of Philadel
phia, declared that "speechmaklng
Is the great bane of our people."
He pleaded for Irish unity and in
sisted that if after tho war Benglum
is to be restored, Poland m ado free
and Serbia put back where she was,
Ireland should be given her ancient
place as a nation.
"We have been too inuch given
to eloquence," said Chairman Ryan
In presenting the next speaker. "We
have been superb in passing reso
lutions, but we have not been so
efficient In carrying them out. Ire
land has need of fewer orators und
wore men of action. Thero lived
among you for mnny years a man
cf action. He was Irish of the
Irish, who gave his strength, his
years and his llfo for Ireland. This
man was O'Donovan Rossa." The
mention of the old dynamiter's
name brought the convention up
cheering, which was renewed a
moment later when Mrs. Jeremiah
O'Donovnn was presented. The lit
tle faded woman, dressed In black,
covered her confusion by reciting
the poem, "We're Irish Every
where." At the afternoon session there
were also brief remarks by Dr. R.
E. Thompson, of Philadelphia: Col.
Louis D. Conloy and J. Harry
TIcrney, recitations by Mrs. J. J.
Rooney and Brandon Tynan, who
read Emmet's speech from the dock,
and songs by Miss VIda Mllholland.

VOICE FOR PEACE.
Pope Benedict has again raised
his voice for peace. In a special
letter written for tho Lonten sea
son, the Pontiff says ho can not sit
silent. Indifferent to the terrible
conflict which is rending Europe. He
recalls all that he has done to in
duce the contending nations to lay
down their arms, virtually throwing
himtelf between tho belligerents and
conjuring them, in the name of the
Almighty, to desist In their plan of
mutual destruction.
The Pontiff again sets forth the
proposal which he made some
months ago, as follows: "Each
belligerent should clearly state his
desires, but should bo ready to
make necessary sacrifices of pride
and particular Interests, thus onding
the monstrous conflict in accordance
with justice and re-establishing
peace, advantageous to neither side
but profitable to all, and theroforo
a just and lasting peace."
"This paternal voice," continues
the Pope, "was not heard. Thus tho
war continues with all its horrors.
I rejoice that our cry for poacu has
had a profound echo in the hearts
of the belligerent peoples, Indeed
the peoples of the whole world, and
has aroused a deep deisre that the
sanguinary conflict soon cease. I
must therefore once more raise my
voice against this war which ap
pears as tho suicide of civilized
Europe"
The second part of the letter
deals with prayers, penance and
alms to be devoted especially to the
relief "of the pitiful children of
thorns dead In this horrible war."

DISAPPROVES AND DEPLORES WAR
Cardinal Fnleonio, formerly
Apostolic Delegato to the United
States, made an exception to his
rule a few days ago and granted
an Interview to tho Rome cor
respondent of the New York Sun,
because, he said, he wanted to
speak as an American to his fel
low citizens. Cardinal Falconlo
said that the policy which the Holy
Sco has followed in regard to the
great European war has beon one
of absolute and impartial neutrality
and that this stand occasionally has
been misunderstood, chiefly owing
to the fact that Pope Benedict
XV. Is almost expected to sit in
judgment on the belligerents and
decide who Is wrong.
In explaining the situation and
pointing out the principal reasons
why the Popo hns to be neutral
Cardinal Falconio said:
"If His Holiness should evon ex
press a personal opinion as to who
is right and who is wrong in 1111s
war it would follow no a matter of
course that he' would practically
bo siding with ono group of
belligerents against the other. The
Pone disapproves of war ami de
plores it. His mission on earth as
the head of tho Catholic church
is essentially a peaceful ono and
naturally enough all his efforts are
directed toward peace.
"The Popo has been powerless
to avert tho war. Neither before
nor since Its outbreak has tho dis
pute which started the conflagra
tion been submitted to him for
arbitration or mediation, and he
enn not assume the role of judge.
alas, so far not oven that of peace
maker. Tho sovcrolgn rulers 01
other neutral nations are in the
same position as the Pope. They
can not do anything to stop tne
war or to shorten It.
"Pope Benedict XV. Instead
strove successfully to lessen the
horrors of tho war. He used his
Influence on behalf of victims of
tho war non-combatants and dis
abled prisoners. He raised his
voice in protest when the laws of
humanity and the usages of civil
ized warfare were violated. He
repeatedly and eloquently appealed
to the rulers of the peoples at war,
urging them toward peace, and at
his request prayers for peace wore
raised In every Catholic church and
In every Catholic home throughout
the world. Could the Pope have
done more?
"It is absolutely necessary, apart
from any other consideration, for
tlio Holy See to obsorve tho strict
est and most Impartial neutrality,
as otherwise tho Pope's influence in
favor of peace would be lost. Ev
ery rlghtmlnded person will admit
as much and only those whose
minds are biased think wrongly
that tho Pope's efforts toward poace
are based on motives of partiality
"I have heard it said that an
Indication of the Popo's leaning
toward Austria-Hungary 1b afforded
by tho fact that Mgr. Fruhwlrth,
the Apostolic Nuncio In Bavaria,
who is an Austrian citizen by
birth, will bo created a Cardinal nt
tlm next consistory. Mgr. Fruh
wlrth has been Apostolic Nuncio
for more than eight years. He
has been raised to tho purple on
account of his services, not on ac
count of his nationality, juat as
In former years other diplomatic
representatives of the Holy See
have been similarly honored even
if of foreign nationality."
WHY Tins WAR.
Cardinal Francis Bourne. Arch
bishop of Westminster, In his
Lenten pastoral letter, declared
that the world-wide war is the out
come hot of the failure, but of the
rejection of Christianity. "There
is," he, said, 'no nation guiltless in
this respeet. England, indeed, will

be preserved from sucli forgotful

to proclaim, as part of public pol
icy, that moral evil is nonexistent
where the. Interests of the State
are concerned and that all means,
right or wrong, honorable or dis
honorable, may be omployed when
tho needs of the country demand
them. Bu$ England has had her
part, and a great and leading part,
in tho revolt against the funda
mental tenets of Christianity in the
sixteenth century and the sub

religion, which In so many nations

The following account In the
Chicago Tribune tells .of tho riot
caused by tho anti-Catholic meeting
under the auspices of tho Guardians
of Liberty Inst Wednesday with ex
Priest Slattery and his wife as tho
speakers of tho evening:
Boulevard Hall and tho regions
adjneent to Garfield boulevard and
Halstcd-s.tr eot-wero-sccnes-of-rlotlng
Inst night when a mob broke up an
anti-Catholic meeting conducted by
Joseph Slattery and nis wife, under
tho auspices of the Guardians of
Liberty. Slattery, who claims to
havo been formerly a priest In the
Catholic church, and who Is now as
sailing that church, was driven to
bis hotel under a police escort. Only
ono arrest was made. Policemen of
tho Englowood station brought In
Patrick S. Brennan, of 821 West
Garfield boulevard. Tho police said
he struck and knocked down u pas
senger In a street car. He wub
cooked by Lieut. Enrlght. or the
Englowood station, on n charge of
disorderly conduct. Later J. W.
Merrlon, of 5621 South Peoria
Rtreet, obtained his release on $400
bonds.
The meeting was called at 8:20
o'clock. There are said to have boon
around COO persons in the hall when
Slattery nroso to speak. Slattery
said later that about 200 of those
present scorned disposed to make
trouble. "1 was speaking under the
auspices of tho Guardians of Lib
erty." Slattery said after his flight
In a taxlcab to the Hotel Sherman.
"I wns ordained a Catholic priest,
and later relinquished my orders.
But I was merely lecturing on free
speech. I had not proceeded far
when a band of about twenty young
mpn encored nnd Tcfused to pay the
eritranco fee. They were ejected by
the police. Later on an old man
started out to disturb mo by asking
questions. I called for order, and
It seemed that about 200 young men
becanio boisterous. - A policeman,
whoso number, I believe, Is 1133,
nnnouneed that he would permit no
further speaking. The noiso and
yelling bocamo so pronounced I
could speak no further and the meet
ing was broken up."
One street car, after getting under
way with n load of those who had
been to hear tho lecture, was stopped
when tho trolley was pulled off the
wire and a half dozen men pulled
out and beaten. There were fights
by the score In tho snow and the
police were unablo to quell tho riot
ing. Early In tho rioting tho tele
phone wires were cut from tho
stores in tho neighborhood and at
tempts to call tho police were futile.
Finally a dotachmont from tho En
glowood station in command of
Llout. Enrlght arrived and attempted
to restore order. Yells of "down
with the A. P. A.'s" greeted tho ar
riving policemen and the pelting of
missies continued. Presently patrol
wagon loads from the Thirty-fifth
Btreot and Stockyards stations ar
rived. Somoono who had beon un
ablo to got tho police station on the
telephone turned In a fire alarm nnd
presently two companies of firemen
galloped up.
The Guardians of Liberty Is said
to have a number of prominent cit
izens among Us members. Charles
R, Young, Rear Admiral G. W. Baird
and Llout. Gen. Nelson Miles are
listed as officers.
The following Is a synposls of
Slattery's Tecord: Joseph J. Slattery
was a Dublin priest dismissed by
Archbishop Walsh for drunkenness.
Came to this country and entered
Colgate Seminary to study for the
Protestant ministry, from which Jn
etltution he was expelled; later went
to Philadelphia and was expelled
from tho Baptist church by the
Philadelphia Conference. Later on
no was arrested in Boston for selling
immoral and obsceno literature.
This record, however, did not pre
vent the Detroit Baptists from taking
him In. He has since married the
woman who styles herself as an ex
nun, of whom a sketch, Is given be
low. Slattory and his wife lecture
under tho auspices of the Guardians
of Liberty and kindred societies.
r"he Menace has conferred a "rw-
torate" on both Slattery and his
WHO.
Margaret Slattery, the wife, who
claims to bo nn ex-nun, formorly of
the Convent of tho Poor Clares,
Cavan, Ireland, is as trustworthy as
her husband. Tho records of tho
convent show that no ono of her
name was ever thero; no ono of her
namo can bo found to have over lived
In tho town where sho says she
lived. On Juno 29, 1883, the date
she claims to have entered the con
vont, there was no one admitted on
that day. The nuns she mentions in
her lecturo are all fictitious and can
not be found In the convent records.
Her whole story Is a poor woven
myth and people of England and
Ireland are well acquainted with the
fact.

Hill.
Measure Vests Knormous Power
in Hands of Few County

"Will Breed Anarchy and Dissen
sion in Itanks of the Dem
ocratic Party.
AN UNWISE POLITICAL MOVE
The Ilutchcraft bill, known as
the saloon regulation measure,
passed the Senate Thursday by a
vote of thlrty-flvo to two. Senator
Charles Knight and Senator Sam
Robertson, of this city, being tho
only two to oppose .this measure.
The bill now goes to Gov. Stanley
for his approval and with his signa
ture attached, of which there is no
doubt, the bill will become a law
Immediately. Senators Knight and
Robertson tried to delay passage of
tho measure, as Sonator Knight
stated that he had some amend
ments to offer, but both were over
ruled by Llout. Gov. Black and a
voto was taken ovor tho protests of
tho two Louisville Senators. Tho
Prohibitionist members lined up
solidly in support of the bill, none
seeming to realize that they wore
being used as a lever In Ihe build
ing or a political machine that will
create anarchy in the ranks of tho
Democratic party before the State
convention In May.
Tho Ilutchcraft bill takes tho
reigns of government out of tho
hands of the legally elected offi
cials In overj county in tho State,
which Is a blow to Democracy, and
tho fact that supreme power is
placed In tho hands 0111 a Common
wealth's Attorney Is another stag
gering blow not only at Democracy
but against the Inherent rights of
the people. That tho peoplo will
rebel Is an absolute certainty, und
in that rebellion the Democratic
party is bound to suffer. It re
quires no great logic or penetration
to realize that under this obnox
ious measure the saloonkeeper and
liquor dealer can bo buffed about
at the will of one official in every
district and whipped Into support
of any political machine with which'
the Commonwealth Attorney is al-
llgned.
Looking at it from a political
standpoint, and Democratic at that.
It Is a short-sighted policy on tho
part of the administration backers
who see a possible way to control
the different county committees. To
show that this Is tho programme
the administration's press agent in
the Cincinnati Enquirer on Sunday
says that the Louisville Democratic
leaders will be punished for the
support of Beckham In 1914. etc.
To begin with, the Democracy of
Louisville was never for Beckham
or Haly, as the writer In these col
umns has asserted moro than onco.
and tho Democrats of Louisville as
a whole havo always refused to
rally to his support, the vote in the
primary for Beckham being mighty
small, and most of that was given
at tho urgent request of the Even
ing Post. Domocrata who voted for
Beckham did so with bad grace,
and only did so out of gratitude
for tho support of tho Evening Post
in the municipal raco of the year
provious. Now If Louisville Democ
racy Is to be punished and per
secuted for this, what will bo the
consequences? They will bo driven
from a defensive standpoint nnd
against their wishes into an alli
ance with the Beckham-Prohlbition
faction. What would bo the out
come if tho Haldeman-Wattorson
crowd obtained local control and
