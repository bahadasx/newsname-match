ACT OF PRESIDENT
Punitive Expedition Not to
Be Considered iri Nature
of
Intervention
Washington, D. C., March 10.—
The Mexican embassy got
te,e"
gram from Oen. Carranza late to
day aaylng that 5,000 troops from
various garrisons to the south had
been ordered to move upon the
Villa bands.
Late today an expression of re
gret from Oen. Carranza for the
Columbus massacre was received
by the state department. No offer
ef" cooperation with American
troop* for hunting down the Villa
bandits was made but If one does
come it was said that It hardly
could be refused.
Mexico City, March 10.—Oen.
Carranza does not care to make a
statement In regard to the situa
tion resulting from the raid on
Columbus, N. M. A rigid censor
ship has been imposed. News
papers are printing nothing of the
raid and the public hab not been
advised of It.
San Antonio, Tex., March 10*—
MaJ. Gen. Funston
Will
personally
command the expedition which
will invade Mexico and capture
Villa unless the war department
orders otherwise.
Gen. Funston is at Ft. 8am Hous

tions.

4- Washington, D. C., March 10 Presi
dent Wilson today ordered American
"1v troops over the Mexican border to cap
ture or kill the VillaT bandits who yes
terday raided Columbus, N. M.
Jt Major General Scott, chief of staff,
of the army, announced that the ex
pedition would consist of not less than
6,000 men, all of which are available
on the border under Major General
Funston.
No orders had been issued to the
"navy this afternoon hut it was consid
ered probable that some of the At
lantic fleet might'be placed in Mexican
waters to'he, near if Americans in
5*: coast towns were endangered by anti
V.American demonstrations. The govern
ment is reluctant to make any naval
demonstration that might be construed
i:as
against Gen. Carranza.
Elesio Arredondo, Gen. Carranza's
ambassador here, received the news
of the president's decision with the
". {statement that he could make no com
ment and would at once notify Gen.
:r:Carranza. Yesterday he declared it
was his own opinion that such action
would not be resented.
Not Intervention.
In its present stage the president's
"order does not mean armed interven
tion in Mexico. It provides for a puni
'tive expedition to deal with lawless
forces over which the Carranza gov
ernment has no control.
*, The following statement was issued
1 4^ at the white house:
"An adequate force will be sent at
,,, :once In pursuit of Villa with the single
object of capturing him and putting a
IfHfctop to his forays.
This can be done and will be done
,in entirely friendly aid of the constl
jtuted authorities in Mexico and with
scrupulous respect for the sovereignty
-Mot that republic.''
?7h It was Bald at the white house that
fcrfthe American government wants Villa
P'Sdead or alive and that no Bteps will be
^neglected to carry out that object.
It was declared that the United
States will not consider the punitive
'expedition an Invasion of Mexico and
ilwill continue to deal with the Carran-
za
•••ri'
government. The -American govern-
!ment
is still opposed to armed inter
vention in Mexico but has decided that,
the peace of both Mexico and tho
United States is imperilled by the con
tinued activities of Francisco Villa.
The cabinet was unanimous in decid
ing
that Villa must be caught.
Congress Wildly Excited.

VILLA'S PUNS TO
HIDE U.S. MADE
PAPERS LEFT BEHIND IN FLIGHT
ARE FOUND BY AMERICAN
SOLDIERS.
Columbus, N. M., March 10.—Pa
pers found on the battlefield opposite
here yesterday revealed that Francis
co Villa decided last October to war
against Americans. This step, accord
ing to Villa's personal documents,
was taken immediately following
recognition by the United States of
the Carranza de facto government,
and began with the institution of Vil
la's campaign in Sonora, which end-'
ed .disastrously at Agua Prieta on No
vember 20. Among the papers found
was an alleged agreement between
Villa and Mexican residents of Colo
nla Morelos, near El Tigre, to take up
arms and oust MormonB and other
Americans, confiscate their property
and operate their mines and farms.
Villa was tq furnish the Mexicans
of the district with JjJve stock, to bei
delivered by April, 1916, "after he'
had overcome Carranza and estab
lished himself as supreme chief in
Mexico."
Another of the papers acknowl
edged receipt of $25,000 in gold from
the Consolidated Cananea Copper Co.
at Naco, Sonora, shortly after Villa's
retreat from Agua Prieta. The re
ceipt credited the money to export
duties on copper ores from Cananea,
but a notation showed that the money
really was paid for the lives of three
Americans held as prisoners and who
at the time were reported to have
been marked for execution.
Zapata Aid Asked.
An Invitation to Gen. Emiliano Za
pata to march north and join in an at
tack on the United States was sent
by Francisco Villa in January, accord
ing to one of the letters found among
Villa's captured papers. The letter
was dated San Geronimo, Chihuahua,
January 6, 1916.
"I shall not expend another shell on
brother Mexicans," Villa wrote in the
letter, but will prepare and organize to
atitack the Americans on their own
soil and let' them know that Mexico
is a land of the free and the tomb of
traitors."
Villa proposed that the joint move
ment with Zapata against the United
States should occur six months from
January 6. Zapata so far as known
made no move to accept and this may
have been responsible for Villa's de
cision to march on Columbus alone.
Villa, In the letter, attributed his de
feat at Agua Prieta last November to
the action of the United States govern
ment in permitting Carranza military
authorities to send over American ter
ritory reinforcements tor the Mexican
town opposite Douglas, Ariz., and de
clared that act an invasion of the sov
ereignty of Mexico and an insult to the
people.
"At that time," Villa told Zapata, "I
restrained, but with the greatest diffl
culty, the impulse .of my. troops to at
tack the city of Douglas."
Carranza, he also stated in the let-1
ter, had sold Mexico to the United
States agreeing to lease Magdalena
bay for ninety-nine years and giving'
over control of the Mexican National
railroad.
BORDER FAVORS PURSUIT,
Columbus, N. M., March 10.—Civil
and military authorities along the
border here todiay gave unanimous ex
pression in favor of immediate pursuit
of Villa by American troops when the
contents of Villa's correspondence be
came known.
Carranza authorities, according to
official reports from Juarez, would not
object to the entry of American troops
into Mexico to attack Villa.
1,
In fact, messages have been receiv
ed here stating that Carranza cavalry
had left Guzman to take the bandit
chief in the rear with the expectation
that American
troopB,
whom they sup­
posed to have already crossed" the
border, would attack him.
ILLINOIS MILITIA
IS READY FOR WAR
Chicago, March 10.—Illinois state
militia, numbering 6,500 officers and
men, would be available for active
service in Mexico within four hours,
if President Wilson should call for
volunteers. Four thousand would come
from Chicago.
Most of this statete military organi
zations have recently passed an inspec
tion by war department representa

Columbus, N. M., March 10.—Army
border patrols and armed civilians
early today maintained a'close watch
for the reappearance of Mexican ban
dits along the border. A report that
armed Mexicans had appeared oppo
site Benson's ranch, fifteen miles
west, was being Investigated by mili
tary authorities. On receipt of this re
port a considerable body of armed
civilians left here in automobiles.
Unconfirmed reports of the appear
ance of Mexicans near Victoria also
were received.
Maj. Frank Tompkins who yesterday
returned to Columbus with troopers
that followed Villa into 'Mexico, esti
mated the Mexican dead in the battle
with Villa's rear guard at fully 100.
Death List is Sixteen.

Americans Executed.
In addition to those killed by Villa's
men in Columbus, several others are
believed to have been executed by the
bandit chieftain before the American
invasion. Arthur McKinney, William
Corbett and James O'Neill, employes
of the Palomas Land & Cattle Co.,
which property was raided on March
1, were captured and are said to have
been executed. Edward John Wright
and Frank Hayden, taken prisoners
near Pearson, Chihuahua, recently, are
also believed to have been killed.
Mrs. Maud Hawk Wright, wife of
John Edward Wright, was taken pris
oner with her husband and after nine
days of captivity was released yester
day during the height of the battle be
fore Columbus. Her baby, she said,
was taken from her and she was told
given to a Mexican family.
The first reinforcement arrived early
today when the first battalion of the
Twentieth infantry,, 250 men, under
MaJ. William R. Sample, arrived from
Ft. Bliss on a special train. The bat
talion, after receiving a fresh supply
of ammunition, was dispatched by Col.
H. J. Slocum, commanding the troops
here, to Victoria, thirty-two miles
W6&t«
Other troops were reported to have
been dispatched at various points
along the border.
Costly For Villa.
The pursuit of Villa and his men
yesterday by 250 American cavalrymen
under Majors Tompkins and Lindsley
ended when the Villa force made a de
termined stand after reaching a seri
ous of hills fifteen miles south of the
border. The casualties to the Ameri
can forces during this battle consisted
of the death of a corporal whose name
has not yet been learned and the
wounding of Capt. George Williams,
who sustained a bullet wound in the
hands. The Mexican casualties in this
engagement were not reported.
The attempt of Villa to carry out his
threat to "kill all Gringoes" proved
disastrous to his own men. It is esti
mated that more than a hundred Mexi
cans were killed and twice that num
ber wounded in the assault upo^ Cot

CORRESPONDENCE FROM SALONI.
Kl INDICATES OFFENSIVE
MOVES FOR MAY.
Saloniki, Feb. 5.—( Correspondenoe
of The Asociated Press The great
Balkan offensive of the allied armies
is popularly believed to be arranged
for the first week in May. Should
weather conditions prove exceptional
ly favorably it may occur even earlier.
That it will take place soon, no one in
Saloniki doubts. The only thing that
can stop it is for the Germans and the
Bulgarians to move first—and there is
little belief in this contingency.
The increasing stores of munitions
and supplies arriving in this port, the
cans tan hard~work"of Gen.'sarrail and !etup Jn
i.his staff, the'activity of the allies
the high
scouts and aeroplanes and the high
I spirits of fhe French and British *galn
soldiers and the eagerness of the**1®"!®'
Serbs to get themselves in fighting
trim again at the earliest possible
moment add to-the conviction that an
allied offensive from Saloniki in the
spring is a certainty.
There are today some. 85,000 French
and 120,000 British troops here which
is about a man to- every foot and a
half of offensive line to be held. Be
sides the British and French, there are
a total of 236,000 allied troops as
garrison for Saloniki, not counting the
troops. Every preparation to this en] ^er
has been made Ions' since. The French
naval hiislon' under Commander Picdt,
the British naval mission under Ad
miral Towbrldge, not to speak of the
Russian marines under Lieut. Volko
vlnsky and the French aerial squad
ron. were not idle during their stay in
Serbia the first year of the war.
Roads were inspected, the peculiarly
inaccurate Balkan maps,
which
ported upon, in view of just such a
contingency as a general Balkan offen
sive through Serbia at some later date.
All of this data is now in the hands of
Gen. Sarr&il and additions are being
made to it every day from aerial ex
plorations and the reports of Serbians
making their way through the hostile
lines.

FRENCH PLEA8ED.
Paris, March 10—The situation at
Verdun is regarded as much better
from the French viewpoint, as a re
sult of yesterday's fighting. The pub-
nn*
stinted sacrifice of life, the Germans
have failed to bend, much less break,
the blue line.
The inference drawn is that the
German wave has advanced as far as
Is in its power without further wast
age on a larger scale, which the Ger
man general staff hesitates to make,
with four army corps already put out
of action in the struggle of eighteen
days.
•Exhausted by three days of violent
efforts, the,assailants called a rest to
replenish the depleted ranks of infan
try. The French took advantage of
the respite to sweep, out the Germans
still remaining in Corbeaux wood and
in this effort were most successful.
Discussingv the attack directed
fropi iLes Caurettes, about a mile
down the Bethlncourt-Cumi^res road,
against the Germans, an officer of
light infantry said:
"I had never seen my men go at
the enemy with such fury. They
clearcTd my section of the Cumieres
wood in less than an hour.
"At one point on the opposite edge
of the wood, a German machine gun
was posted in a ditch, protected by
breastworks of felled trees. It poured
a deadly fire into us. A sergeant and
twenty men voluteered to drive out
the enemy.
"Advancing by leaps and bounds
from tree to tree they got in among
the Germans with bayonets. They
took the gun- and turned it about,
starting a raking fire on the Germans.
This did not last ldtog for they soon
jammed the gun In their enthusiasm.
"By early afternoon virtually the
whole wood was in the hands of the
French. The Germans, however, pre
pared another onslaught which began
at dusk. The fighting lasted all night
and most of Thursday. The Germans
steadily lost ground until at nightfall
of yesterday they retained a bare
footing in the wood.
