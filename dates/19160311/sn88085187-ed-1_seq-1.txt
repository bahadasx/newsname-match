CHAPTER 111.
Elect No Secret Foe of City-
Owned Utility Plants
BY THE EDITOR
In giving your vote to candidates for city com
missioner it is important that you know how
they stand In regard to municipal ownership.
The City of Tacoma owns and operates a wa
ter system worth many millions of dollars.
It owns ant} operates a lighting plant worth
other millions.
It owns and operates a dock valued at several
hundreds of thousands.
It owns one car line.
In the next few years the city might wish to
extend the scope of these Operations.
In any event we will want to retain all the
municipally-owned utilities we now possess.
Consequently it is imperative that no more
commissioners be elected who are not heart and
soul in sympathy with the principle of public
ownership.
# ■ *
One underhand way in which the present
council showed its enmity to municipal owner
ship was in trying to rob the light and water
fund of its rightfully earned money.
When the li) 16 budget was in process of for
mation last summer the commissioner! got to
gether and decided that it would be much easier
For them to transfer a large sum of money from
the light and water fund into the general fund
than it would he to make a legitimate reduction
of the expenses in their various departments.
So they voted to rob these funds of about
That showed both mental laziness and a de
cided lack of genuine economy.
Wone than that, it was a deceitful attempt to
discredit municipal ownership, also a fraud on
the merchants, manufacturers and householders
of Tacoma.
For in using the money those RESIDENTS
had contributed and applying it where it would
reduce the taxes of NON-RESIDENTS, most of
them speculators who hope to profit from the un
earned increment.
It was so flagrant a robbery that The Times
had no great difficulty in heading it off. After
six days of hard hammering we made the foiii
lnissioners turn a complete somersault. How
ever, in other and more suhtle ways the same
practice is still going on.
AND, TACOMA VOTERS, IF YOU DON'T
ASSERT YOURSELF IN THIS CAMPAIGN
THE SAME OLD THING WILL HAPPEN
AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND THE NEXT.
Why? Because it's the easy course. It's the
course that the public service corporations and
other special interests like— BECAUSE IT IS A
COURSE THAT DISCREDITS MUNICIPAL
OWNERSHIP.
# # #
The public heretofore hasn't been awake to
the significance of these tactics. It has been
blinded more or less by the word Mprofit".
The subtle boys who secretly hate the idea of
municipal ownership vet profess to be its friends
continually urge that the city-owned plants be
made to earn a "profit". When this profit ac
cumulates, they favor transferring it into the
fund that will help Mr. NON-RESIDENT.
Instead, the profit ought to be made a REAL
PROFIT for the patrons of the plants. RAT US
OUGHT TO BE CUT, and the receipts and dis
bursements made to balance exactly from year
to year.
See, in this campaign that you put every can
didate on record in this matter. Make him tell
you how he will treat our existing city-owned
plants, and what his attitude will be toward ex
tending their scope.

Banks have a creative
force, stronger perhaps than
that of any line of business.
Through their general policy
they concentrate the funds
of the community and re
loan them for the benefit of
the community.
It 1b essential that every
person play an active part in
thus building the community.
There can be no better ad
vertisement than the total
amount of deposits in the

make times better and Is
therefore beneficial to every

"What'll you take, six months

up to J. 1). Fordlt, a Tacoma
street car conductor, by Police
Jtldgo UeWitt M. Evans, this
morning.
"Why-ah, I guess I'll get mar
ried, judge," stammered the con
ductor.
And the marriage was then
and there solemnized in Judge
!•_. vans' private office.
Irene Tuel of Sumner, who
was arrested some time ago for
participation in a "joyride" on
the Puyallup road, was the bride.
Fordit's father was the "best
man," and a young girl accom
panied Miss Tuel as bridesmaid.
After the girl was released
from her recent sentence of '.0
days, she eloped with Fordit.
They went to Seattle, but arrived
just after the mariage license
bureau had closed for the day,
according ot their story.
They returned to Tacoma and
rented housekeeing rooms, Fordit
continuing his work as a conduc
tor. The question of a formal
marriage ceremony was discuss
ed from time to time and post
poned for various reasons.
This week Fordit began re
luming home late from his run.
Finally lie did not return at all.
