Preparedness
IF what has been go
M ing on around Verdun
i ' ( , during the past fifteen
days means anything, it
means that Germany
has put forth her ut
most strength to break
the coils drawn around
her in the northwest.
Whatever the result
she will have about ex
hausted herself. So has
France.
No matter how bold
may be the front that
either may present, the
splendor of both their
armies has been re
duced to well nigh a
forlorn hope. It is differ
ent with Great Britain
and Russia. They rep
' resent a power and te
nacity of purpose as
yet not to be computed.
But both give promise
of making a better
showing this year than
last. Russia is already
doing so. The capital
of Turkey is in more
f danger right now than
& it has been before since
? p the days of the Crusad
I (, ers. Not in immediate
X danger, but an enemy
? far more powerful than
herself is even now
thundering to the east
,$ of her, and there is no
I power to protect her
f any more as there al-f-
ways has been.
r The raw recruits of
j Great Britain have been
jj V trained into battle
I4 form during the past
! eighteen months, train
ed by millions and
there is no thought of
their quitting.
From all this the con
clusion is reasonable,
that aside from train-
'" ing our young men, and
seeing that enough mu
nition plants are estab
, lished with facilities for
swift transportation
from them to the coast,
our country's chief con
cernment should be to
strengthen our regular
iu navy, our submarine
assassins and our aircraft.

w - S. McCORNICK, son of George and Mary McCornick, was born near Picton, Prince Edward
W county, Ontario, Canada, September 14, 1837.
1 I m W. S. McCornick worked on the farm until he was twenty-one years of age. It was
MS good for him for a man who can make a living on a Prince Edward county farm will find
everything in life after that easy.
Mr. McCornick had a public school eduation. In 1860 he turned his face to the west, and in
California worked on a farm near Marysville, and for two years was a combined farmer and teamster.
He was then drawn to Virginia City, Nevada, remained there one year, then went to Austin, Lander
County, where he was engaged in "the lumber business for seven years. He then followed the rush t
0 Hamilton, White Pine county, where the great Eberhardt mine was yielding $17,000 per ton. When
that camp went into a decline he went to Belmont in Nye county where he purchased mines for
a San Francisco company and built a twenty-stamp quartz mill, but the cream of that camp had
already been skimmed, and the next year ho removed to Salt Lake City, which place he reached
May 5th, 1873.
His old time betrothed, Miss Hannah Keogh, of Bellville, Ontario, came west and married him
in January, 18G7.
A month after reaching Salt Lake Mr. McCornick joined with Mr. A. W. White in a small ban
(Continued on page 1G.)
The reason is that H
when the present war's H
forces shall have been M
exhausted, the most ap- M
palling spectacle to M
them will be the almost M
hopeless weight of debt M
upon them. M
They will be looking M
in all directions for re- M
lief and the most hope- M
ful place to them will M
seem to be South Amer- M
ica. Some of them can M
quickly reason them- M
selves into the belief M
that if they can help fl
themselves by cultivat- M
ing the as yet wasto jH
soil of South America, H
we will have no right to M
interfere, and that to M
fight our country they H
will take us as far from iH
our base as they will , H
have to go. H
Again, when Japan H
gets all ready, she will
suddenly cease dissem- H
bling and reveal herself
with her mask off. The H
way to meet her will be H
ship for ship and with H
if possible, more sav- H
age guns. Formerly if H
one asked a Japanese H
boy what he was going '-H
to do when he grew up, H
he would at once reply, il
"Going to fight Russia." IJ
Ask him now his reply (fll
will be, "Going to fight
United States." M
The way to avoid H
that is to have Japan H
understand that she is H
outmatched by our H
country in both ships ,H
and guns. 11
The battles around H
Verdun have demon- 'H
strated once more that iH
costly and scientific H
fortresses do not count H
for much in modern de- H
fenses. The money they H
cost can better be ex- H
pended in trying to pro H
duce more terrible guns H
than any yet known, ev- H
ery realm of science H
should be explored un- iH
til the one thing is H
found in one or another 'H
field that because of its H
destructivencss wars H
will finally be dropped, 11
