DRAINAGE PROJECT IS
PROGRESSING RAPIDLY
SAYS MANAGER CARDON
- Engineers to be here Monday to Lay
out lines for Drainage tile. $60,000
will be expended on this project in
laying tile.
Work on the drainages project about
two miles west of Logan belonging
to the Logan Land and Drainage Co.
isprogresslng very satisfactorily to
the management. Mr. N. M. Han
son Jr., with a number of workmen,
has ueen surveying this tract of land
ever sinco January and has now al
most completed the work. Next Mon
day H. S. Klclnschmldt of Brown
&. Klclnschmldt, Salt Lake City, the
engineers on the- project, will bo
here to lay out the lines for tho
drainage work. As soon as possible
thereafter actual work will be begun
in tho way of trenching and laying
tho tile. ,
"There will bo over fifty miles of
tiling," said A. P. Cardon, manager
of tho Company, "to bo laid In the
area wo have under our project. This
tiling will bo from flvo to eighteen
Inches in diameter and will bo laid
every four hundred feet throughout
tho land needing drainage. There
will be an expenditure of nearly six
ty thousand dollars for this work
alono. In addition to this wo expect
to lay out roads, to grndo them, to
assist in putting tho present roads
in shape, to remodel tho irrigation
system and to make It as modern as
any system to bo found In tho Inter
f mountain country.
"This drainago work, if successful
and wo havo overy assurance from
the best engineers wo can get in
tho country that It will bo success
ful, will all mean a development In
agriculture In this valloy which has
long been needed. Only a few areas,
such as tho one at Hyde Park and
one at Smithflcld havo been drained
and these havo shown what wonder
ful results can bo obtained by this
feature of reclamation. Tho mlstnkes
mado in theso areas havo been stud
ied by tho drainago oxports of thin

to make theso costly mistakes but

can profit by them, Ono of tho chief
difficulties of thoso areas was root
growth within tho tiles which com
pletely choked them up. These trou
bles can now be overcome by keep
ing tho wholo drainage system flush
ed out and by using other precau
tions which have been ndopted In
other drainage areas. As years go
on, however, it will be found that
most of tho valley floor, especially
where tho heavy clay typo prevails,
will be ruined by Irrigation unlesa
somo means aro used to better drain
tho soli.
It has been the experience of drain
ago in other parts of tho United
States that tho lands have Increased
in their productive powers in ono
season to tho extent of tho cost of
dratning. Right at present there aro
many farms In this valley which aro
losing tons and tons of beets because
tho drainago Is poor. This is notice
ablo In tho case of scalded beets
when tho water has failed to run cf
tho land after irrigation. Frequently
a small depression In a Hold acts as
sort of cup which holds tho water
that does tho damage Drainago can
overcome much of this scalding, and
tho loss of the crops of a single sea
son would pay the cost of such drain
age. That Is why, I think that If our
project down here is as thoroughly
BUCcesBful'aa wo havo every reason
to believe it will bo, that tho cause
of drainage will bo greatly promoted
and agricultural conditions Immense
ly better in this valley. This sort
of work is really a second reclam
ation of tho Desert, as R. A, Hart ot
tho Drainago Service of the United
States has said."
Tho Logan Land nnd Drainage
Company is considering tho purchase
of two machines which will bo ubci!

TOS500.000
Anderson & Som Company Also Add
Two New Director, to Their
Number
In tho oDlco of tho County -Clerk
was filed on Thursday an amendment
to tho articles of Incorporation of tho
Anderson and Sons Company whith
Increases tho capital stock of this
company from $100,000 to JGOO.000,
enlarges tho directorate of this rapid,
ly growing business from flvo to
seven persons. In tho amended ar
ticles tho following officers and di
rectors aro named: Anthon Ander

Anderson VIco-Presldent and direct,
or; A. B. Olscn, Secretary, Treasur
er and director; Hobert Anderson,
General Mannger and director; M. S.
Eccles, D. C. Eccles and W. And
erson, directors.
With the additional working capital
as provided by the amended articles,
tho Anderson and Sons Company bo
comes ono of tho largest lumber
dealers In tho state. Whllo Logan Is
tho chief distributing center, tho
company has been extending Its
branch yards so that now they are
found In practically overy town of
any slzo in northern Utah and south
ern Idaho. Tho prospects nro that
more yards wl'l bo opened in other
towns and thus tho business of this
pioneer lumber concern is making Its
Influence felt In nil territory which It
serves.
Tho Anderson and Sons Company
dates back to tho year 1890, when
Anthon Anderson, tho president of
tho company which bears his name,
first entered tho business. Of course
ho did not do as much business then
as tho company does now, for this
concern at tho present time, has but
few rivals in tho wholo lntor-moun-tain
region.
Thero aro fow lumberyards, If any,
In tho entire state that can handlo
their business with the dispatch and
efficiency as can tho Andorson and
Sons Company.
I While Mr. Andorson wns foundor
of the company, nnd It hns nlwoys
been In a flourishing condition, its
I I greatest growth dates back to tho
1 1 year 1908 when tho lato David He
i cles Interested capital In the business
s nnd today thero Is nothing In the
business, and today thero is nothing
' in tho building lino which requires
lumber in Its construction that can
not bo supplied by these yards. The
mill in Logan is ono of tho most
modern and up to dato in tho West.
It Is equipped with tho best and tho
latest machinery for turning out first
class building materials. Tho most
dellcato machinery for Interior fin
ishings for work of tho highest or
der all find place in this mill.
Tho management of this company
is to bo congratulated on Us splendid
business and on tho envlablo position
which It holds among llko concerns
throughout this territory.

At the regular monthly meeting or
tho directors of tho Club held on
March S, communications from the
Industrial Club and Holstcln Brec.1
ers Association of Richmond, invit
ing tho pcoplo of Logan to attend tho
Black and Whlto Day at Richmond,
March 17 were read. It was decided
that tho Club work up an excursion
to Richmond for this day.
It has been suggested that a Dairy
day bo had overy year and establish
a market for tho pure bred cattlo
whero buyers from all over the Inter
mountain may como to purchaso and
sell cattlo
Tho club committees no doubt will
get in touch with tho Richmond club
committees and work to this end for
another year. If worked up properly
It would be tho means of leavlns
thousands of dollars In Cacho Vnlloy
ovcrp spring. Richmond Is now tho
dairy center of Cacho Valley. Tho
holding of nn annual Dairy day would
bo tho means of Btlmu'atlng tho oth
er towns to lmprovo their herds and
becomo centers.
HASTY BUYING
MAY MEAN
LONGJEGRETS
If you can't get a Super-Six today
wait fpr it!
Ddil't bo -persuaded into buying nn
Inferior car. Don't allow our good
judgment to be stampeded by a clov
er salesman. Don't be hasty In buy
ing, or you may bo n long, long tlmo
regretting.
Thero is a wonderful now princi
ple embodied In tho Super-Six motor.
How marvelous that discovery Is you
never wl'l realizo until after )ou havo
owned and driven your own car.
Thero Is no "bunk," no "hot air," no
misrepresentation of nny kind In tho
car, in tho advertising, in tho deal
er's statement'.
Tho Super-Six Is Just what wo
Bay. It does .'list what wo sny. It
has proved to tho satisfaction of
American Automobilo Association of
ficials, and scores of prominent en
gineers to bo everything that we
claim.
But you cannot enjoy tho advan
tages that aro waiting for your ac
ceptance If you rush hastily Into tho
purchaso of an ordinary car rather
than wait for a few days, or wcoks,
for your Super-Six.
Tho spring buyer is eager for his
now car. Ho thinks ho cannot wait.
But If he gets It during the months
of snow, mud, bad weather and had
roads ho can do little- with It. How
much better to drive tho old car or
none' and get delivery of his Super
Six all bright, beautiful, and fresh
at a tlmo when roads nro good, wea
ther Is settled, and ho can enjoy his
new car to tho full.
Tho Supor Six Is worth waiting for.
You nover enn know how well worth
It until after you drlvo It.
If you glvo up tho SupeivSlx hast
ily, carelessly without thoroughly un
derstanding what you are missing,
you'll havo somo long, long regrets
ahead of you.
Delivery of Super-Six Is expected

PRIMA DONNA
SINGS DUET
WITHHERSELF
Wonderful Demonstration of Tone
Reproduction by Phonograph
Is Given
Ogdcn, March S Comparison of
tho human voice with tho recreation
of the somo voice by means of an
Edison phonograph wns mado at tho
Alhnmbra theater here this afternoon
when an audience of more than 2000
persons nttended a complimentary
concert by Miss Elizabeth Spencer,
nn American soprano who has pre
pared soveral records for the Edison
company. Thero woro nlso several
flute solos and a general musical pro
gram. Tho principal object of tho demon
stration was to show that there is no
tonal chnngo when the human voice
or musical noto Is recreated. This
was successfully shown when Miss
Spencer rendered ono of her own
songs In duet with tho phonograph
and tho lights wero switched off. Tho
singer had modulated her volco so
that it was equal to tho recreated
volumo nnd in most parts of tho big
theater It was lmposslblo to doter
irlno when Miss Spencer was sing
ing, ns tho movement of her lips
could not be Been.
In another demonstration tho tal
ented soprano sang a duet with her
own volco ns recreated on tho ruach
Ino. Tho success of this numbei
was such that It was ropeated. Tho
lluto boIob, especially thoso played
with a silver Auto of purest tono qua!,
lty, were among tho beat numbers on
tho program. Tho concert nlso had
tho effoct of demonstrating that tho
accoustlcs of tho Alhambrn theater,
following n recent treatment of tho
walls, aro almost perfect.
Tho Harris Music Company, prom
ises to glvo tho peoplo of Logan n
tono test concert In tho near future.
Mr. Frnnk Hnrrls who heard Miss
Spencer at Ogdcn also states that tho
nrtlclo abovo was not overdrawn, and
that Miss Spencer has a wonderful
personality. Ono very notlccablo
thing to her credit Is that sho never
speaks anything but pralso for those
who aro following n musical career
llko herself. Wo will bo glad to play
ono of Miss Spencer's records for any
ono who wishes to call nt our storo.
