LARGE BEAR CHASES
YOUNG WOMAN A MILE
Blairsville, March 9—Miss Sue
Rassler, 18 years old, who lives at
Furnace Run, Armstrong county,
a small settlement across the Al
legheny river from Kittanning.
had the most thrilling experience
of her life the other day as she
was walking along the road near
her home. She was encountered
by a large bear, which made for
her.
Miss Rassler started to run and
the bear ran after her. She says
she was followed for more than a
mile by the animal and just as she
reached the power house of the
Mohawk mines she fell uncon
scious. A physician was summon
ed and she was taken to her home,
where it was found that both her
feet had been frozen, and there
may be serious results from the
exposure and fright. There was
no bear around when Miss Rass
ler was found by the employes of
the power house, but it is thought
that the buzz of the machinery
frightened bruin away.
