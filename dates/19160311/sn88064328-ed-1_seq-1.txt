effect upon!
the country. The senate partic
ularly which contains many vig
orous critics of the administra
tion's Mexican policy has just
settled down from the flurry over
the Cusi massacre of several
weeks ago.
At the State Department it was
said that the situation was "very
serious." hut that no announce
ment of what action corld he tak
en would he announced until an
official investigation was con
eluded.
The Department is understood
to have hegun the draft of a mem
orandum to Gen. Carranza. hased
on the report of Hen. Funston.
At the White House the only
word given out was that steps
would hp taken to punish the
V ilia bandits out it was not indi
cated whether Gen. Carranza
would hp called upon to do so. or
whether American troops would
he sent over the line.
Senator Fall of New Mexico,
Republican, one of the foremost
opponents of the President's
Mexican policy, sent telegrams to
railroad officials and citizens in
the vicinity of Columbus asking
for details.
The news of the raid spread
over the eapitol with startling ef
feet. Senator Stone, chairman of j
the foreign relations committee,
at once got into communication'
with the State Department and
asked Senator Fall for a confer
ence. j
Senator Robinson of Arkansas,
Democrat, said: "
"That means intervention. I
don't see what else can be done."
the i
Senator Tillman declared
news was almost incredible.
"There never has been a presi
dent who tried so hard to keep
out of war as President Wilson,
he said, "but if this is true, it
j looks as if Gen. Funston would
I have to get busy at once."
The State Department's mem
orandum is being prepared with
a view to its disnateh in case Sec
retary Lansing decides to present
the case to Carranza. It prob
ably will hp drafted along lines
similar to the communi-at ion s»'iit
to Carranza on the Santa Ysohel
massacre, but because of th»' more
serious aspect will probably he
firmer.
i
At the White House the report
of tin- massacre was received with
evidences of the greatest concern.
Officials most familiar with the
President's Mexican policy were
silent, but they indicated that the
raid had brought the situation to
n critical point, where it might
he difficult to stand by the policy
of non-interference. ;
After the President and N. I)..
Baker had discussed th»' reports
briefly, the President decided that
the new secretary of war should
take office at once. He signed
Mr. Baker's commission and the
new secretary went to his new
office to b<» sworn in.
One of the probable courses
most discussed in official circles
was to semi American troops
over the line to clean out the
bandits. It was pointed out that
such action could be taken with
a ueeiaraiion inai mere was no,
intention to impair the sove-l
reignty of Mexico, or purpose of;
occupation of territory, but wa s j
situation
patw
simply to deal with a
menacing to the American border j
over whi.-h the Carranza govern
ment evidently had no control.
There is some conflict of opinj
ion regard mi g the authority of
he War Department to send
troops into a foivi«rn country
without the consent of Congress.
Those who doubt the authority
contend that all American tro»q>
ers may do without further au
thority would bp to repel Mexi
can marrauders by fire.
Other officials, however, con
tend that the constitution vests
the President with the authority
to repel invasion, and that au
thority they sav includes the pow
»r to send troops over the line.

Similar Cases Eeing Published in
Each Issue.
The following case is but one
of many occur; iiii.; daily in New
Iberia. It is an easy matter to
verif.v it. You cannot ask for
better proof.
W. A. Walsh. 7L'!> Center St.,
New Iberia, says: "My kidneys
and bladder were in bad shape
and wlici: attacks of the trouble
cam. on, I was in awful pain. My
back ached and 1 felt miser. 1 hie
all over. The kidney secretions
were discolored and conteiued
sediment like hrickdrst. The se
retions were also painful in pa>
sage. Nothing did me any good
until I got Doan's Kidney Pill., at
Taylor's drug store. After I had
taken three boxes, my kidneys
acted nornullv and I didn't have
any more trouble from the kidney
secretions. I now feel better in
every way and liav n't had a re
turn of the trouble."
Price at all dealeis. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy

BUREAU DOES GOuD
WORK.
CHILD
j
How government can be of use
to the people is being demonstrat
ed every day by the Children's
Bureau. The 'bureau has been
sending out a series' of articles on
ffnet!arc oMhe Baby,"lHiich any
body can have free by writing to
the bureau, in Washington. A
bulletin on "I'arentai care is
one of the best publications ever
issued by a government depart
ment and contains the most up-to
date and best medical advice to
the prospective mother. Any one
can have a copy free by sending
a request to the Children's Un
real!.
This is merely an illustration of
how useful our government could
be made if it were really social
ized. The Children s Bureau in
terferes with nobody 's pocket -
'book, and so it is allowed to ex
ist, but it is storing up some ugly
facts about our industrial system
and its effect on the babies which
capitalist iiulustrv may some <fay
have to face.

Another government depart
ment which is doing rsefui work
is the Public Health Service. This
service has made a beginning in
serving the people. One health
problem it has recently attacked
is the malaria problem in the
south. Following surveys in thir
ty-four places in nearly every
state of the south, the Public
Health Service was able to reduce
the malaria cases from an inci
of 50 per cent in U>14 to
less than 4 or 5 per cent in UM"».
This was done simply by telling
the people how to prevent ma
laria. Had the bureau had some
of the money that is annually
wasted on battleships and guns,
it could have reduced disease in
the United States to an enormous
extent and the Public Health
Service would undoubtedly be
one of the principal activities of

Washington policemen arrested
a girl the other day because she
read their palms and told their
fortunes when she was not a reg
ularly licensed palmist. Think
of the public being imposed upon
by the spurious revelations of
palm readers not duly vouched
for and sponsered by the govern
ment of the District of Columbia.

with disgust; the lawyer scoots
along the street and covers me
