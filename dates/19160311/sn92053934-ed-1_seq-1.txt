left to General Funston.
Secretary Baker specifically refer
red to the expedition as "defensive" in
line with the administration's policy
of regarding its action as one to repel
invasion.
No American troops crossed the
border this morning. Many dispatch
es from General Funston, however, in
formed the department as to the dis
position he was was making of his
forces.
Secretary Baker said that v.hatevor
reinforcements General Funston
miffht require to maintain an adequate
patrol along the border in addition to
the expeditionary force could be
ptomptly furnished. The department
h;:.; not l:eeu advised whether Gen
eral Fut.ston would lead personnaly
the ; t iitionary force.
Volunteers Mil Needed.
There was at present, Secretary
Baker said, no need for summoning
volunteers to the colors although the
depaiunt ut appreciated lully the pat
riotic spirit behind the deluge ot
off-'-rs.
General Funston confirmed today
officially the killing of Pablo Lopez,
Villa's chief lieutenant in the raid on
Columbus and also the report that
Lopez commanded the bandits who
murdered nearly a score of Americans
a! Santa Ysabel. General Funston al
to oon'irnii-d the report that 409 Car
ranza troops had reached I'alomas,
six miles south of Columbus, to join
in the pursuit of Villa.
Fi:ty-; yen dead Mexicans have
been found in and about Columbus.
General Funston reported. General
Kunston said the effectiveness of the
fire ot the American troops during
the encasement was splendid.
"itei'enshe" Expedition.
Secretary Baker today referred to
the American expedition as a "de
fensive one." This was regarded as
a significant indication of the the ad
ministration to make it clear that it
is progressing with scrupulous re
gard for the sovereignty of Mexico and
entirely iu aid of the constituted au
thorities. Villa was today reported moving
southeast with not more than 300 men.
Last night's report gave his force as
3,000 but that is believed to include
sympathizers in his territory.
Villa Hand Located.
Latest reports of the whereabouts
of General Villa say he reached As
cencion, south of Palomas, some time
yesterday with 300 followers after his
flight following the attack on Colum
bus. This Information reached here to
day in a message to the Carranza em
bassy from Consul Andreas Garcia at
El Paso.
Consul Garcia reported that Cen
tral Gavira, military commander at
Juarez, was informed of this by Gen
eral Hertani, from Palomas, at H
P- m. yesterday. Hertani also reported
Villa bad 60 casualties in the encoun
ter with the American troops at Col

FEAR FOR SAFETY
0FM0RM0NS FELT
Critical Position of Farming Colony
Further Menaced by Approach of
Villa Men.
El Paso, Texas, March 11. The pos
ition of the 500 members of the Mor
mon farming colony in the Casas
Grandes district, Chihuahua, 158 miles
by train from El Paso, critical as it
was in the first place, has been further
menaced by the presence of Villa with
a band of 300 followers at La Ascen
cion, close to the railroad over which
they must travel to the safety of the
American frontier.
Carranza guards from Chihuahua
City were expected to accompany a
train load of refugees due to leave
Casas Grandes for the north last night
or early today.
The natural covers of the land near
La Ascencion, however, afford protec
tion, should Villa attack the train.
In El Paso, hope for the escape ot
the Mormons is based largely on the
unverified rumor that Villa is short of
ammunition. Although only 300 men
are reported to be with him at La As
cencion, Villa still has a force of 2,000
ir that region.
The arrest of number of well
known Villa agents by the El Paso po
lice, iucluding a5 general who was try
ing tc buy arms in a gun store, a col
onel wao was found in the general's
home and an alleged spy with penciled
maps of Mexican railways in his pock
ets, indicate that the situation in El
Paso has been more serious than has
appeared on the surface.
La Constitution, a local Mexican pa
per was suspended by the police last
night and all editions seized because
of an inflammatory article against the
United States. Furthermore, the mili
tary authorities at Fort Bliss received
word that a large quantity of rifle mu
nitions was taken from a place of con
cealment in the Mexican quarter and
put in a wagon train presumably bound
for Villa's camp. As the wagons could
not have crossed the international
bridge, the pursuit of the soldiers in
automobiles took place on the road
that follows the boundary on the Amer
ican side.
Traffic over the international bridge
between the Mexicans on both sides of
the boundary, usually large, has de
creased materially. Horse racing still
goes on in Juarez but the attendance
from the El Paso side is less than halt
the normal. At night heavy guards
are placed on patrol along the boundary
'and at the smelter, the light plant and
J other points open to attack,
j The troops at Fort Bliss are await
jing orders to wove at auy moment.

on Border Trouble. .
ASKS COOPERATION
Would Send Mexican Troops
Into This Country to
Hunt Bandit Bands.
Washington, March 11. General
Carranza, through Consul Silliman, has
asked the American government for
permission to send Mexican troops
across the border and into the United
States in pursuit of bandits.
Consul Silliman transmitted the fol
lowing communication dated at Gua
dalajara, March 10, which was handed
to him by Jesus Acuna, Carranza's
minister for foreign affairs. It Is a re
ply to the Amercan government's rep
resentations for permission to pursue
the Villa bandits with American forces.
Carranza's Reply.
"In due reply to your courteous note,
dated yesterday and transmitted today,
through John W. Belt, Silliman's
secretary, I have the honor to inform
you that having brought the above
note to the attention of the first chief
of the constitutionalist army and de
pository of the executive power of
Mexico, he has directed me to say to
you, to the end that you may, in turn,
transmit it to the department of state
ot the American government, that he
learned with regret of the lamentable
incident which occurred in the town
of Columbus, N. M., on account of the
assault jt suffered yesterday from the
bandits led by Francisco Villa.
"That although there has been a
competent number of forces in the
state of Chihuahua to reestablish or
der and afford protection to nationals
and foreigners, ever since Francisco
Villa appeared in the mountains of the
above state, at the request of the gov
ernor of the state and of the constitu
tionalist consul In El Paso, Texas, the
first chief ordered the timely depart
ure of 2,500 men commanded by
General Luis Gutierrez with in
structions to pursue the bandits who
had Just crossed the line to American
territory, which they undoubtedly did,
compelled by the tenacious pursuit of
the above mentioned forces.
"The above lamentable incident Is
similar to the Incursions which were
made in the state of Sonora and Chi
huahua by Indians from the reserva
tions ot the government of the United
States. Incursions into the state ot
Sonora occurred more or less about
the year 1880 when Geronimo, the In
dian chief, who died not many years
ago in Fort Mount, Ala., led a numer
ous horde and invaded a part of the
north of the state of Sonora, commit
ting many murders and depredations
of life and property of Mexican fami
lies, until after a long and tenacious
chase by American and Mexican forces,
the band of malefactors was annihi
lated and its chief was captured.
"The incursion into Chihuahua, led
by the Indian chief, Victoria, command
ing 800 Indians took place between the
years 1SS4 and 18S6. Then the bands
of marauders committing also many
crimes, went into the country a. far as
the village of Tejolohic of Tres Castil
los, very near the capital of Chihuahua
and during the first formal encounter
between them and Mexican forces,
after having lost their chief, they were
dispersed.
"In these two occasions through an
agreement betwen the governments of
the United States and Mexico it was
decided that the armed forces of one
and the other country might freely
cross from the territory of one to the
other in pursuit and for the purpose of
punishing the above named bands of
marauders. Recalling these incidents
and the good results for both countries
on account of the above agreement, the
government presided over by the first
chief, anxious to exterminate within
the least possible time the hordes led
by Francisco Villa, who has been re
cently placed beyond the law and to
capture him to apply condign punish-,
ment, resorts to you as a confidential
agent and addresses the government of
the United States requesting the nec
essary permission for Mexican forces
to cross into American territory if the
incursion which took place in Colum-
1 tin a fihmiM litlfurf imo olir a yanioliuY
in any other point of the boundry line.
The Mexican government would great
ly appreciate a prompt and favorab!
reply from the government of the Unit
ed States.

Agent, the assurances of my high con-
