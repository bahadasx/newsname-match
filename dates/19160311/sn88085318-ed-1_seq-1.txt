OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
The project to raise the parcel
post weight limit from 50 to 100
pounds was lost in the house of
representative! by a majority of
40. The republicans voted al
most solidly against it, while a
majority of the democrats, includ
ing Congressman Dill, voted to
raise the limit.
There is to be another election
this fall, with the democratic
party opposed by the republican
party. The party and the men
who favor the express companies
at the expense of the people and
popular service are distinctly
marked. The Examiner will be
pleased to hear such excuses as
standpatters have for favoring
congressmen who oppose the ex
tension of the postal service, or
who oppose such men as Dill who
favor giving the public the bene
fits of greater postal facilities.
There is more to a political
party than its name. The issue
is being drawn quite closely be
tween those who favor popular
privileges, and those who favor
special privileges for certain cor
porations.
The Columbia river valley near
Kettle Falls has discovered itself
in the bean business. What Bos
ton eats. Kettle Falls may here
after raise.
A representative of the D. M.
Ferry company of Detriot, has
contracted with the owners of 600
acres to raise beans and deliver
them to Meyers Falls for 4V 2 cents
per pound. The seed for the spe
cial kind of bean wanted is fur
nished by the company, also the
sacks, and full instructions are
given when needed. The soil of
the Kettle Falls country was ana
lyzed and found among the very
best in the United States for this
industry, and the price offered
leaves a good margin of profit to
the grower.
The Bank of Colville is doing
some genuine educational work
along the booster line by distribut
ing a number of copies of book
lets on alfalfa. Study of this
booklet need not be confined to
farmers, for every one interested
in the growth of this section can
read with profit the facts relating
to the production of alfalfa in
this county. In-closed in the book
let is a slip which starts with the
wording, "Save a few of them
and you will realize why they put
the Goddess of Liberty on the
dollar."
This has been "better baby
week" throughout the United
States. We hope that a compila
tion of the week's record will
show that the babies of the United
States were a trifle batter during
the week than previously, although
Colville statistics seem to show
that they were a little worse than
usual owing to the bad weather.
However, the "better baby
week" has come to stay. A gen
eral effort is made to teach moth
ers how better to safeguard the
health of the youth, how to know
and demand purity in foods, and
how to handle the diseases inci
dent to childhood. The state has
taken over the problem of the
education of the child, but the
health of the youth is still de
pendent upon the parent. There
fore the parent is being educated
to the plain facts of food and hy
giene, and the result will be not
only "better babies'' but a better
citizenship for the future.
Before the war mills of the Pa
cific northwest had an ocean
freight rate on Hour to China and
.Japan as low as $3 a toti and never
higher than $5. The astounding
prohibitive charge is now made
of $40 a ton —2 cents a pound, $1
freight on a 50-pound sack. Pas
sage of the La Follette-Furuseth
seaman's act was followed by the
abandonment of American lines

OLD HICKORY CHIPS.
Necessity is also the mother of
preparedness.
Funny some of those "acci
dental" (ires never happen in a

"See America first" sounds
good to the preparedness man.
NO wonder money talks. Isn't
there a woman's face on the coins?
Smne men look into the muzzle
of a gun to see if it is loaded—and
others fool around married women.
We judge from the republican
exchanges that President Wilson
was responsible for those disas-
trous Hoods in California and
Arkansas.
Evidently when Moses called
Canaan the Land of Promise, he
didn't know much about Germany.
The horrors of war continue to
increase. It is said that London
is now talking American slang.

The state of Washington is pay
ing dearly for the men she sent
to the national capital who voted
against President Wilson's ship
bill. With no merchant marine
of our own and with the refusal
of the republican contingent to
aid in securing one, the American
producer can ship his wares at
the other fellow's price— or he can
stick his goods in his eye.
The northwest wants the Orient
al trade. Some certain eastern
financial interests did not want
the government to enter the ship
ping business. Some certain con
gressman from this state favored
the eastern interests by a vote to
kill the shipping bill. And this
state gets the hole in the sack.
However, those who like this
system can of course keep on vot
ing for it.
The republican party confesses
that after 16 years power, and at
a cost of $300,000,000 spent under
the guise of national defense,
there is no army, no navy, no
aviation corps, no submarine
branch, no fortifications, befitting
this nation and able to maintain
an adequate defense.
Now the question comes to the
people: Shall we be charitable and
give them 16 years more to see
if they can't do better, or shall
we follow the business man's
theory of hiring no man who has
proved himself incompetent?
Sometimes a little common
sense mixed with the political
game will make the other fellow's
proposition seem quite foolish.
Judging from newspaper re
ports from the various cities and
towns of the state, the present
liquor law has proved a revela
tion to those who formerly be
lieved that local option and high
license were the best financial
methods of handling the liquor
iraffic.
Spokane county has found that
the number of arrests has sudden
ly decreased to the minimum, with
fewer indigent! to care for. fewer
crimes, and less court costs.
Sheriff Miller states that in Ste
vens county the results of the
new law are quite evident in his
office, the arrests having dropped
to the vanishing point, with the
results of the excessive use of
liquor in little evidence in any
part of the county.
If all people were temperate, no

trouble would arise from the use
of wines, lii|uors, beers, or cor
dials. Hut unfortunately the in
tern perates cause the trouble eveu
for the temperate*, and the pres
ent law seems tended towards
forcing all people to be temperate.
The results show for themselves.
We recall no instances wherein
the state press united in praising
the financial results of local op
tion. We find no record of the
open towns being free from vio
lence and drunkenness for any
length of time. But the news
papers of the state are now giv
ing many columns to the new con
ditions found under the regulative
law. The inference is that the
present kind of a law will have to
be retained until all the people
are educated to judgment in eat
ing and drinking—which will
probably be a long time after we
are all dead.
TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courtesy of the American Rank
ers Association, Savings Bank Dept.)
HOW THE BANK "MAKES"
MONEY.
It would seem that after the
bank takes your money, protects
it, pays it back on demand or as
you order, lends you money, dis
counts your neighbor's note for
you, it would have nothing else
to offer in your behalf. But it
has—it "makes'' money for you,
and incidentally makes money for
itself.
When you see the president or
the cashier of a bank signing his
name to a row of four crisp new
bills (they always come in sheets
of four) you may wonder what
he is doing, and what is behind it
all. We w,Sll show you by a
simple illustration. Let us sup
pose you want to borrow a thous
and dollars and offer your note
to your banker. He knows you,
knows that you will pay, and
wants to accommodate you, IFe
looks at his books and says: "1
can't spare the money. The liiw
says I must have fifteen cents oui
of every dollar I owe my depos
tors in cash, or where I can get
it on demand; and I have just
what the law requires. Ff F give
you credit for the note and let
you check against it, I increase
my debts and make my condition
worse, for if f do not pay you in
cash I must stand ready to <lo so."
But being a resourceful banker,
and knowing how, In; asks you
* <> wait, a minute while he goes to
his strong box. He finds a gov
ernment bond which he bought a
year ago when be had plenty of
span- money, for cash, and comes
hack smiling and says: "Very
well, in three days you can have
your money. I will turn this)
bond into hank notes for you."
So he sends the bond to Washing
ton, and in return the govern
ment sends him 200 crisp new
five-dollar bills, to be signed by
two officers of the bank, cut and
handed out to you.
The government keeps the bond
as security that he will redeem
the notes in "lawful money" on
demand—that is, pay greenbacks
or gold for them if demanded (but
this is seldom done), pays him in
terest on the bond and you pay
him interest on your note for the
use of his notes, and both arc satis
fied.
You see, l>y this proposition, he
has turned your note into hank
notes, with himself behind it mid
the government behind him. Your
promise wouldn't go very far from
home, these promises will. Kvery
liody knows them. They arc
"money" and circulate! H such.
Now what has the banker done
by this process? Me has furnished
the community as well ,-is you with
aireuliting medium, handy to all.
Nc Ims taken your credit and
turned it into bank credit. lie
makes money and you take the
money he has made and make
some money for yourself. It is

m very simple proposition, under
stood by few, but practiced by
many. ll' you don't fully under
stand it, ii.sk your banker to tell
you more about it. This feature
of banking, however, is performed
in Hi is country only by banks un
do- control of the federal govern
ment, namely, the nutional bunks
and federal reserve bunks, but is
a common banking practice the
world over, differing in form but
not in substance, it being a uni
versal function of the bank to
turn credii which is unknown into
thai which is known and will
therefore be freely taken, and
bank note credit is the most com
mon and useful form.
The United States senate, by a
vote of l(i to 22, lias passed the
water power bill and paved the
way for the greatest boom to
northeast Washington ever known.
The liill provides for leasing water
power sites for 50 years, giving
control dI rates to the various
stales, and providing against any
combinations which will restrain
the output of electrical power.
The Hill now goes to the house for
rat ification.
The bill, if passed by the house,
means that the Columbia river
and the I'end Oreille river may
be opened to capital for power
development, after many years of
constant, effort to secure some fa
vorable action by congress. It
means an unprecedented develop
ment for this great section rich in
power resources. It means cheap
light, power, heat, and current
transportation and for mining de
velopment. It means factories
and industries where now there
are none. It means activity on
the banks of the streams where
now fishermen and woodticks have
sole possession.
The conservationists in congress
bitterly opposed the bill—as usual.
The college-boy idea of the east
is to keep our resources intact so
that future generations may do
something with them for the bene
lit of the whole country. But we
who live here believe that water
will still be running in our streams
alter Pinehot and his gang have
all been wafted to their special
corner in the conservative here
after, and that we ourselves should
have a part of the prosperity
which of right belongs to this sec
tion wherein we have settled and
made our homes and aided in de
veloping all that haR been de
veloped.
Senator Poindexter, who is a
candidate for reelection, voted
against the bill.
