JUDGE FAVORS AN AGREEMENT
Creditors Plan Campaign In County
In Effort to Create Sentiment
for the Plan.
Judge Van Vnlkenburg In the fed
eral court at Kansas City appealed to
tho county Judges of 2t. Clair county
and tho representatives of creditors
of tho county for 4 million dollars to
compromise and end. forty-fire years
of litigation. March 24 wns set by
the judge for all Interested parties to
appear there and discuss an ending
of tho light.
Tho fight had Its beginning In 1871
when the county Judges of St. Clair
county voted bonds to help promoters
build the Nebo & Neoaho railroad
through tho county. Tho road never
was built.
The county lias always refused to
pay the debt and tho principal and In
terest have grown to 4 million dollars.
This Is said to bo tho total assessable
value of all tho property in St. Clair
county.
County judges have evaded service
of federal authorities, others have
been put In jail for refusing to obey
cuurt mandates nnd still other county
judges liavo hid In the brush In defi
ance of the federal court. Tho citi
zens of the county have backed the
Judges In theso tactics. Always they
havo refused to pay or to compromise.
Judge Van Valkenburg said the con
troversy had become a stain on tho
state. Ho said ho did not desire to
bo compelled to pass judgment. Rather
ho desired to sit as a friend of both
sides and help them to como to an
amicable agreement.
The Impression at the end of the
hearing was that those concerned
would campaign in St. Clair county
tho next month in an effort to bring In
a compromise plan March 24.

PLAN TO ENTER A PROTEST
The National Garment Makers Woula
Bar Goods Made by Convicts In
Missouri Prison.
Plans to do away with the use of
convict labor at tho Missouri peiilten
tlary in the manufacture of goods for
sale wcro mado at a meeting of tho of
ficers and trustees of the National As
sociation of Garment Manufacturers
at Kansas City recently. Missouri
members of tho association also were
In attendance.
"This is oue of tho few states that
still permits the output of prison con
tractors to compcto In the open market
with the products of factories In which
operatives aro paid living uges," said
Gnlbralth Miller, Jr., bl Milwaukee,
president of tho association.
"The prison contractu pays a small
sum to the state for each day's work
by each tf tho convicts. Ho Is fur
nished vfith power, light, heat aud rent
by tlio stato and pays no taxes. As a
result, manufacturers find it impos
sible to compete with him on au cquul
basis.
"In tho penitentiary at Jefferson
City for Instance, are mado overalls,
jumpers and shirts which arc sold In
competition with the labor of free men
nnd women. That tort of thlug is an
evident injustice.
"Wo aro seeking to ellmnlato this
unfair competition not only from the
garment trade, but from all other
trades with which the prisoners have
to do.
"The various stato institutions con
sume an enormous quantity of manu
factured goods each year. We would
have tho prisoners make these sup
plies. Also there has been some agita
tion of putting the convicts at work
building roads. Many activities for
them could be found which would not
conflict with outsldo interests, both of
capital and labor."
A bill will bo prepared for Introduc
tion in the Missouri legislature taking
the convicts out of competition with
factory workers. Tho association also
is seeking support for pending legis
lation In congress, known as the
Hughes bill which gives a stato tho
right to prohibit convict-made goods
Imported within its borders from
another state.
DEMOCRATS PICK ST. JOSEPH

Tho natural production of
I first-class furs seems to bo
H I approaching a suro end, nnd
I tho growing world-wldo do-
manu lor uicm .requires
that the present supply bo
supplemented with stock
obtained through domestica
tion. Experlenco has demonstrated
that somo of tho fur bearers may bo
raised without difficulty. This Is like
ly to lead to tho establishment of fur
farming on a small scale as an addi
tional sourco of incomo on farms In
many places along our northern
border, much as poultry Is now raised.
When properly conducted, fur farm
ing may become vory profitable. It
will pay not only In direct returns to
the producer, but indirectly, tho nat
ural aud legtttmato deslro for furs can
bo gratified, tho extirpation of tho
most valuablo and Interesting of our
fur bearers can bo prevented and an
oxtenslvo department of manufacture
and trado supporting a large popula
tion can bo continued.
Success In domesticating wild ani
mals, as In other branches of hus
bandry, depends on experience, adapt
ability, and prudence. No one should
cngago in tho business unless ho en
Joys It and ls-famlliar with the habits,
characteristics and climatic require
ments of tho animals he intends to
propagate. Tho cholco of location Is of
primo Importance The best furs como
from cool, moderately humid regions
It a locality furnishes native furs of
high grade, that locality Is favorable
to the domestication of fur bearers
The climate of the mlddlo and south'
em states is not well suited to this
industry, as shown by tho medium or
,low prices commanded by furs from
theso areas. Tho ratio of expense to
Income must be considered with caro.
One cannot pay tho exorbitant prices
animals for stocking purposes some-
times bring, and expect to raise fur at
a profit. Neither can ono expect to
ralso furs of a lino quality from infe
rior stock. But given a normal mar
ket for breeding stock and pelts, a fa
vorable location, a love for animals,
and an ordinary degree of prudence,
ono may ongage In black or sliver fox
farming with a good prospect of satls
factory returns, provided, of course, a
high prlco for pelts Is sustained.
Values of animals and pelts were very
high a few years ago, when tho Indus
try was being launched, but aro now
on a much lower basis. Persons who
contcmplato going actively Into tho
business or Investing their mouoy in
corporations or companies organized
for fox farming should thoroughly In
vestigate It In all its phases.
Tho namo "silver fox" as commonly
used by furriers, Includes tho dnrk
phases of the ordinary red fox, varl
ously called sllvor, silver gray, sliver
black, or black. It should not bo con
fused with tho gray, or true fox of tho
United States, tho fur of which Is of
comparatively littlo value. Tho color
of tho red fox of the northeastern
states and of Its allies of tho colder
parts of North America varies from
rod to black, and tho30 extromes, with
their graduations, form four moro or
loss distinct phases, known respec
tively as red, cross (or patch), silver,
and black.
The color of silver foxes varies from
grizzly to puro black, oxcopt for a fow
whlto-tlpped hairB on tho back and
rump. In the black phase, tho whlto
Is absent from all parts except the tip
of the tail, which Is whlto In all four
phases. Tho red phase Is much moro
abundant than the others, hut all four
Interbreed freely, and wherever one
occurs occasional examples of tho
others may bo expected. In general
the cross fox is fairly common, tho
silver gray scarce, and tho puro black
very rare.
No Improvement.
"Don't you know," remarked the
humorist, "that it is Impossible for mo
to think nnd , operate tho typewriter
simultaneously."
"That being the caso," rejolnod tho
editor, "you aro no better off than
when you used a pon."

Domestication of tho fox was first
achieved In 1894 by Robert T. Oulton
and Charles Dalton on Prince Edward
Island, a Canadian province In tho
Gulf of St. Lawrence. Sliver fox pelts
havo continuously f commanded high
prices, and hunters have been corre
spondingly keen to securo them. It Is
not strango, thercforo, that tho first
successful breeders of this raro animal
were men who had pursued It In the
chase. Tho two mentioned had hunted
foxes together, and had frequently
bought and sold fox pelts of tbelr
neighbors. Oulton was onco lucky
enough to shoot a silver fox tho skin
of which netted $138. Becoming im
pressed with tho possibility of domesti
cating such valuablo fur bearers,
Oulton and Dalton separately experi
mented In building fox-proof fences
and In feeding and breeding tho ani
mals. After soveral years' work on
theso problems they formed a partner
ship In 1894, built a ranch and stocked
It with two pairs of silver foxes. This
became tho first profitable fox ranch,
tho forerunner of a remarkable and,
for that region, a revolutionary In
dustry. At that tlmo black pelts brought
much higher prices than silver pelts.
This prompted Oulton & Dalton to re
tain their darker animals and dlsposo
of tho lighter ones, and as a result
each successive lot of pelts from their
yards was darker than thoso of pre
vious years. Finally in 1910, they
wero able to send to tho London sales
tho finest collection of silver fox pelts
that had over appeared there.
Dlsclosuro of the results of tho 1910
sales was tho climax of the first stage
In tho development of fox farming.
Peoplo who formerly had known some
thing of the business wore now eager
to engage In it, Thoso having money
invested in foxes. Others mortgaged
their farms for tho purposo of fitting
up ranching facilities and boarded
foxes for a share of the progeny. How
rapidly prices for breeding Btock ad
vanced is well Illustrated by the expe
rience of ono ranchman who sold his
first pair of cubs for $750, and other
pairs successively for $3,000, $12,000,
$13,000 and $14,000. In the fall of
1913 good ranch-bred cubs six months
old sold for from $11,000 to $15,000 a
pair. Pairs that had had largo litters
wero valued at about twice as much
as slx-mouths-old cubs.
In tho pioneer days, when proper
methods for handling foxes wcro un
known, many failures rcsultod from
Ignornnco and carelessness. Tho ex
citement following tho fur sales of
1910 hastened tho Improvement of
methods of feeding, handling, and
breeding. It also broko the monop
oly, aiid caused a rapid distribution of
foxes and of Information concerning
them. Now, with a comparatively
largo number of silver foxes In do
mestication, with a clearer under
standing of their successful manage
ment, and with a return of modorato
prices for breeders, a steady, healthy,
and general development of silver fox
farming may bo expected. Fox ranches
are established In most of tho Cana
dian provinces and in Maine, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Now York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Mlchl-'
gau, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon,
Washington and Alaska.

City's Children Slaughtered.
Upward of 300 children nre being:
killed each year in thn iimni. t
York and about 7,500 others injured.' 'j
f
mals aro moro valuablo when pro
duced In northern localities, furriers
havo learned that certain localities
aro not too far south to produce val
uablo furs, but the conclusions they
aro able to form aro of only very gen
eral application. To determine the re
gions suitable for fox farming, there
fore, It is necessary to learn the areas
within which foxes aro known to pro
duce superior fur. Records show that
such localities occur only north of
the southern boundary of the Cana
dian zone. This boundary crosses the
States of Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Michigan, Wisconsin, Min
nesota and North Dakpta, and ex
tends southward along tho mountains
In New York, Pennsylvania, West Vir
ginia, and in all the states of tho
Rocky mountain region and westward.
South of tho forested regions of tho
northern tier of states and western
Oregon, however, tho Canadian zone,
although sufficiently cold, 1b too dry
and sunny for tho production of first-class
fur.
A fox ranch should be situated
whore It will havo good drainage and
bo partially shaded by a young
growth of deciduous trees. Each pair
of foxes should have a runway ot
about 2,500 square feet. They thrlvo
on a varied diet. Including meat, fish,
bread, mush, milk and table scraps.
The reproductive period Is about ten
years. Tho young are born in April
or Slay, tho average litter containing
four cubs; but as only about half of
tho captive females produce young in
any given year, tho annual increase
has not averaged above 100 per cent.
Foxes bear captivity well. No wide
spread disease has appeared among
them. Wounds hoal readily, and
cases of sickness aro usually attribut
able to a lack of propor caro. By
soloctivo breeding tho originators of
fox culture produced a superior strain
of animals in the courso of a few
years. This fact Is an assuranco that
even groater Improvements can be
achieved by selecting, from different
geographic races, foxes of the largest
size and crossing them with animals
having the fineBt fur.
Tho exceedingly high value of sil
ver foxes has led to tho adoption of a
variety of precautions against their
loss. On tho more pretentious ranches
tho animals aro regularly examined by
n doctor and guarded by watchmon,
