Villa started out as a bandit—a
bold, blood-thirsty bandit. He climbed
from the bottom of the social ladder
to a high military post. And now he
has reverted to the bandit type again.

ARMED INVASION OF MEXICO ON
AVIATIOM CORPS WILL GET BAPTISM OF FERE
SHIP SUNK;
AMERICANS
ARE ABOARD
Washington Confronts a New Crisis in Tor
pedoing of Neutral Norwegian Vessel;
American Passengers Are Saved; Prompt
i Action by Wilson Expected
WASHINGTON, March 11—A dispatch from the
American consul at Havre to the state department today de
elared seven Americans were on board the Norwegian bark
Silius, bound from New York to Havre, which was torpedoed
without warning Thursday night, in Havre roads. The Amer
icans were saved. Three o{ the crew were drowned.
The Silius Was the first vessel carrying American re
ported sunk without warning since the kaiser's decree of sub
marine warfare against armed merchantmen Iwcame effective.
Immediately on receipt of dispatches describing the
sinking, it was stated unofficially that the United States would
hold to strict account the nation whose submarine made *he
attack, provided later messages confirmed the original meager
message.
Believe Attacking Submarine Was German
It is believed the submarine was German. Secretary
Lansing will not act officially until he has complete detail*.
Before proceeding, 1 anting must have affi<lavits from
passengers and crew showing "beyond a reasonable doubt
that the Silius was torpedoed.
That the Silius was unarmed is accepted as a fact, a*
»he was a neutral merchantman.
>. said this might make the ease more
tnanany yet confronted By the department during Tne sub
marine disputes.
No power has ever hinted that non-crnnbatants, whether
neutral or belligerent, have no right to travel on neutral
vessels.
America Will Insist on Prompt Punishment
Hven if the submarine had made sut'e of the passengers
safety, America would satisfied, it was stated authori
tatively.
If the attitude of President Wilson and Secretary Lan
ding, as frequently expressed in notes to the central, power*,
has not changed—and officials grimly declare it has not--
America must insist, on an immediate disavowal, reparation
and condign punishment for the offending submarine com
mander.
If this is demanded, it is believed the desired steps wi'l
.be taken without hesitation and without the exchange of
notes, which marked former incidents of like nature.

Gen. Funston Placed in Command of
Punitive Expedition; Army Depart
ment Hopes to Shorten "War" by Quick
Enveloping Movement.
WASHINGTON, March 11.—Behind a veil of censorship already established by the
war department, Maj. Gen. Frederick F. Funs ton today began mobilizing American
troops on the Mexican border to execute the task of capturing Francisco Villa, dead
or alive. Secretary of War Baker said today he did not know whether any troops had
yet entered Mexico.
Despite the fact that high army officials said today they did not believe the Ameri
can expedition into Mexico had started yet, Chairman Hay of the house military affairs
committee declared, after a conference with Secy. Baker: "I believe our troops are now
well across the border on their way to run down Villa and his bandits."
The war department is busy mapping out a campaign which will allow the largest
possible number of troops to return from Mexico alive and unhurt.
To minimize American losses, instructions to Funston directed him to strike hard and
quickly. Facing a campaign of guerilla warfare in unfamiliar territory against a des
perate and treacherous foe, there is no doubt Funs ton's men will probably suffer heavy
casualties.
By an overwhelming and sudden envelopment of all bandits, the army hopes to pre
vent fighting over an extensive area and also to shorten the "little war. If Villa is not
crushed quickly and decisively, military operations on a much larger scale probably will
be necessary.
President Wilson wants to avoid a campaign entailing use of militia or volunteers.
Americans must march thru a wilderness of mesquite-tangled desert, where water
is scarce. Many obstacles will be encountered. The establishment of bases of supply at
various points along the border is a prime factor in the success of the movement.
Funston's word that ambulances would accompany the expedition gave grim warning
that casualties are expected. The signal corps aeroplanes will receive their baptism
of fire scouting after Villa.
The war department today recommended to Funston that a squadron of eight aero
planes at San Antonio be engaged in active service.
President Wilson was yachting today, but he kept in touch with the situation by wire-
Solidly supporting and approving the president, congress has obliterated all partisan
ship and members promised to keep "hands off."
After Sen. Stone had given the senate foreign committee official news of what the
administration had done with regard to Mexico, the committee, meeting today, unani
mously consented Ijo all steps taken.

MORMON REFUGEES SAVED FROM SLAUGHTER;

EL PASO, March 11.—Gen.
Francisco Villa's plan to mas

traveling, pending the result of
Villa's new moves.
The exact whereabouta of
the Mormon party la unknown,
but Garcia Is confident they
will now escape the trap.
The Carranzistas had positive In
formation that Villa planned to In
tercept the Mormons at Guzman
and massacre all, men, women and
children.

Mexican Shot
by American Sentry
Tno rlgldness of the American
patrol around Columbus. N. M . Is
Indicated by the fact that a Mcx-
Ican who failed to halt at command
was shot by a sentry.
Columbus was restless all night,
expecting another attack. It is lw>-
lleved that warning of the Ameri
can expedition reached Villa, how
ever, and that reports that he was
returning to attack Columbus
again were baseless.
Army men deplore the publicity
which has been given their plan of
campaign. They believe this pub
licity prevented them from sur
prising him.
All talk here Is of the hunt for
Villa. None Is positive when It
will begin. It Is believed the main
movement of troops will not start
before Monday.
Gen. Pershing has received ao
word giving hint of when the
smash Is to be launched.
He said all communications with
regard to the Invasion had appar
ently passed bt tween Secretary
Haker and Gen. Funaton.
Perching'* officers admitted,
however, that they believed the in
vasion would be started simul
taneously from HI l'aso, Columbus,
Douglas, Kagle Pass, Tex., and per
haps Brownsville, with the pur
pose of making u clean sweep of
all bandits.
Pershing has sent a detachment
to pursue a Mexican wagon tr.iln
moving westward along the border
with severul hundred thousand
rounds of ammunition Villa had
cached near C'hlhuahuahulta. a
Mexican settlement on the Ameri
can side.
If the Vllllstas approach the bor
der to save this wagon train, array
men admit a clash would result.

wounded soldier in the hospital at.
Fort Hllss, the total number of
American dead as a result of the
