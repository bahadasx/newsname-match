PUBUSHERS ARE
MUCH DISTURBED
Refusal of British Consul in
N. Y. to Sign Certificates
Causes Trouble.
London, March 11.—British pub
lishers who issue English editions of
American books are much disturbed
by the refusal of the British con
sul in New York to sign consular cer
tificates for the export of unbound
books. This action has been taken
presumably under the orders of the
board of trade, which prohibit the
importation of paper except under
license.
When an American book is pro
duced in England, the loose sheets
are sent to the United States and the
'binding and publishers imprint are
added here.
The publishers say that as there is
no prohibition against the import of
bound books, the new order is ridic
ulous, as the shipping of books in
bindings will increase the amount of
space untllized instead of diminishing
it as the prohibitory order contem
plates.
SUB-COMMITTEE
HAS DISCUSSION
New York, March 11.—The sub
comlttee of the anthracite operators
and miners which met here yester
day discussed the demand for an eight
hour day in the hard coal fields. J.
P. White, president of the United
Mine Workers, gave an interpreta
tion of how he expected the eight
hour day to work if the anthracite
operators granted this concession.
The request of the miners embraced
in thier demand covering a twenty
per cent increase in wages also oc
cupied the attention of the confer
ence again today. The miners' rep
re sentatives claimed the increase
cost of living was a serious problem
for the men as the purchasing power
of their earnings was less now than
In the past. They submitted statis
tics computed from data furnished by
business men in the anthracite dist
rict, purporting to show Increases in
rents and other necessities of life.
No agreement was reached on either
question.

AND ON BORDER
ANOTHER RANCH IS ATTACKED
BY MEXICAN fillERUlAS VILLA
IS REPORTED TO BE L0CATH
Washington, March 11.—No definite announce
ment has been made by the war department, but it is
understood that General Pershing will command the
principal column of troops in pursuit of Villa. General
Funston retaining command of the general operations.
It is expected that three columns, probably from
Douglas, Columbus and El Paso are to enter.
NO ADVANCE YET.
No American troops had crossed the border up to
noon today so far as the war department is advised.
Many dispatches have been received from General
Funston, however, informing the department of the
disposition he is making of his forces at strategic
points. Secretary Baker said that whatever reinforce
ments Funston might require to maintain an adequate
patrol along the border in addition to the expeditionary
force would be promptly furnished. General Funston
has confirmed officially the killing of Pablo Lopez,
Villa's chief lieutenant, during the raid on Columbus
also the report that Lopez commanded the bandits who
murdered nearly a score of Americans at Sant Yosobel.
General Funston also confirmed the report that 400
Carranza troops had reached Palomas, six miles south
of Columbus, to join in pursuit of Villa.
NOTE FROM CARRANZA.
Washington, March 11. General Carranza,
through Consul Silliman, has asked the American gov
ernment for permission to send Mexican troops across
the border into the United States in pursuit of the
bandits.
General Carranza's note will be answered after be
ing seen by President Wilson. The reply probably will
say that his suggestion will be considered if at any time
it is necessary for his troops to pursue bandits across
the line through lack of American troops to protect the
country.
FULL AUTHORITY GRANTED.
Instructions conveying full authority to General
Funston to dispatch an expedition into Mexico in pur
suit of Villa and his bandits are now in General Fun
ston's hands. Secretary Baker has announced that full
discretion as to the number of men, route, etc., has been
left with Funston, who is expected to have American
troops in large bodies moving into Mexico before
nightfall.
The strictest secrecy is being observed by the war
department officials regarding the army's plans for
the capture of the bandits. This is in accordance with
the urgent request of General Funston, the object be
ing to prevent Villa from learning of the movements
of the expeditionary force.
Secretary Baker specificially referred to the ex
pedition as "defensive" and in line with the administra
tion's policy of regarding its action as one to repel
invasion.
ANOTHER OUTRAGE.
Columbus, N. M., March 11.—Eighteen mounted
Mexicans are reported as having raided the home of
H. A. Blankenship, a section foreman at Malpias, 18
miles east of Columbus. The family escaped through a
rear door and crawled to cover in the darkness, where
they lay in the brush during most of a cold night. The j§
family was taken to El Paso aboard the train this morn
ing. The Mexicans are said to have passed south into
Mexico.
Seven wounded Villa soldiers who were captured
by Colonel Slocum's troopers in Thursday's battle here
will be charged with murder for the killing of the
American soldiers slain in the fight, according to E. B.
Stone, special agent of the department of justice.. The
prisoners include two officers, and a boy 12 years old.
Arrested.
Scouts have brought In reports
that Villa Is at Boca Grande. S5 miles
southwest of here. Other advices
stated that a large unmber of Carran
za troops had reached PaJomah, sup
posedly to assist in the pursuit of
Villa. The arrest ot a number ot
Mexicans
suspected of being Villa
spies divided the interest among, the
civilians with the energetic prepa­
rations of the military for ttte^
suit of Villa bandits.
