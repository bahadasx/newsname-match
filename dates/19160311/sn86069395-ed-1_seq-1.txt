ant, who directed the massacre of
fiahten Americans at Santa Ysa
beltwo months ago. His body was
identified.
On the issue raised by Secretary
Garrison in his resignation, only 33
Democrats agreed with his ideas when
the House. His
successor is a man who will agree
with the President.

MANY SPEECHES TO BE MADE.;
Strong Case of Circumstantial
Evidence Made Out and De
fense Rests on Alibis.
The defense in the case of Bubbcr
Chafin and Ernest Wilson closed yes
terday at noon after introducing scores
of colored witnesses to support the al
ibi claims of the two men. The defend
ants themselves went on the stand
and denied that they were near the
scene of the shooting. Chafin claim-
ed to vbe working in a tobacco patch ,
uciwcen were uuu luwit. mu unui
was
conflicting in many of its details
and some of the many witnesses were
badly crossed.
The Commonwealth introduced re-1
buttal witnesses right after noon and
speaking began at 5 o'clock. Schedule
had not been arranged, but,the prob
abilities are that there will be three
and maybe four speeches on a side.
A night session was held last night.
The defense attorneys are J. B. Aliens
worth, J. C. Duffy, G. W. Southall
and T. G. Skinner. Those for the
Commonwealth are 0. H. Anderson,

attempted sfiice last report.
The old case of Commonwealth vs.
C. H. Hewlett, charged with volun
tary manslaughter 31 years ago and
the indictment hied away, was rein
stated on the docket and dismissed.

regulation measure was passed by the
senate 35 to 2.
In explaining his vote for the bill,
Senator W. A. Frost of Graves, stated
that while he did not believe the
Hutchcraft measure met the require
ments necessary to enforce the Sunday
closing law and that he had his doubts
abouta bill that was supported by the
brewers and distillers, nevertheless he
would not stand in the way of Gov.
Stanley and thereby prevent the pas
sage of any Sunday closing legislation
at this session.
The Greene bills covering the same
ground were killed.

VILLA LEADS INVADING
INTO COLUMBUS, NEW MEXICO
Sixteen United States Citizens and Soldiers Killed in Pitched Battle Before Raiders Are Driven
Out By Troopers and Pursued Across Border Into Mexican Territory Administration
TRUSTS CARRANZA. WILL MAKE
Satisfaction Felt at Capital That After Three Years of Patience, Troops Are at Last on Mexi
can Soil to Avenge Outrages Act Not Considered Invasion of Mexico.
Columbus, N. M., March 10. Fran
cisco Villa, outlawed Mexican bandit,
raided United States territory yester
day. With 500 men he attacked Co
lumbus, killed at least sixteen Ameri
cans and fired many buildings before
he was driven back across the inter-
Not less than 250 troopers of the
Thirteenth United States cavalry fol
lowed the Villa band into Mexico.
Reports to Col. Slocum, commanding
American troops here, stated that
Villa had made a stand fifteen miles
south of the border, where spirited
fighting was in progress. In this
engagement a private was killed, and
Capt. Williams, adjutant of the Thir
teenth calvary, was wounded.
The small detachment of troopers
under Maj. Frank Tompkins and El
mer Lindslcy, fighting dismounted,
made a determined stand against the
renewed Villa attack, and at last re
ports were holding their ground.
The raid on American territory
proved costly to the bandit chieftain.
The bodies of eighteen bandits, in
cluding Pablo Lopez, second in com-,
mand, had been gathered and burned

before noon, and troopers reported
an undetermined number of dead
still lying in the brush. Led to the
attack under the slogan, "Death to the
Americans," Villa's followers fought
with desperation. Just before dawn
they crept along ditches skirting the
United States cavalry -camp and
rushed the sleeping town, firing
heavily.
TROOPS INSTANTLY GO INTO
ACTION.
The first volley brought American
troopers into almost instant action.
While a portion of the raiders en
gaged the cavalrymen, others began
applying the torch and shooting
American civilians who ventured
from the buildings. Lights in homes
and public buildings immediately be-1
came targets for snipers posted at
Villa's direction. Other bandits,
creeping close to American homes,
enticed a numoer or civilians into
n.
open with English-spoken invitations.
A number of fatalities are attributed

to this ruse.
Stores were looted, oil was poured
upon frame structures and the match
applied by still other bandits. The
postoffice was raided, but the looters
secured only one small registered
package.
Many civilians barricaded them
selves in their homes and fired at the
Mexicans as they darted through the
streets. The fighting in the town
ended almost as suddenly as it began.
The casualties of the Thirteenth
cavalry in the fighting at Columbus
were seven killed and six wounded.
MORE THAN HUNDRED VILLA
I MEN KILLED.
I Villa's total losses in the day's
I fighting were estimated in excess of
100 killed and about as many wound
ed. The American pursuit into Mex
ico was reported to have accounted
for more than 75 Mexicans killed and
wounded.
I The American loss on the Mexi
can side was one corporal slain when
Villa threw out a heavy guard to en
gage the pursuing American troopers,
villa dropped his personal papers
as he went with his fleeinr men back
' i r : a i t i
into Mexico. A
note lound among
these, evidently
transcript of an
order issued just before the attack,
read: "Kill all the gringoes."
Villa's presence here is accepted as
discrediting his recent assertions that
he was not responsible for the assas
sination of eighteen Americans west
of the city of Chihuahua a few weeks
ago.
The outrage was laid at the door of
Pablo Lopez, Villa's second in com
mand. If -so, the Americans have
apparently been avenged, for a body
among the invaders slain by the
troopers was identified as that of Lo
pez. VILLA SEEKING REVENGE IN

The day's events were accepted as
confirmation of recent reports that
Villa, disgruntled at Washington's

rather than robbery, was the motive
behind the massacre.
On Tuesday last Villa hanged three
Americans. Yesterday a ftiL'itive
Mexican, who said that to publish his
name would mean his death asserted
that Villa addressed his meii to the
effect that the killing of Americans
was justifiable because the United
States was responsible

BRIDLES ARE OFF.
Washington, March 10. Washing
ton stands squarely behind Col. Slo
cum in sending cavalry into Mexico
in pursuit of Francisco Villa and his
band of outlaws who raided Colum
bus, N. M., murdering American sol
diers and citizens and firing the 'town.
Secretary Lansing informed the de
facto government of Mexico through
Elisco Arrcdondo, its ambassador
designate here, that he trusted no ob
jection would be made to the pursuit
and punishment of the bandits.
President Wilson to-dav ordered

tion wjll consist of at leust 5,000 men.
This does not mean armed interven
tion, but the punishment of bandits
over whom Carranza has no control,
The pursuit will be continued until
Villa is taken.
Late reports put the number of
dead Mexicans at 200. Villa had 1,
500 men, but only 500 made the raid.

PORTUGAL
NOW IN IT
Germany Declares War on Eng
land's Saucy Little
Ally.
FRENCH HOLDING AT VERDUN
The Germans Held In Check In
Spite of Their Repeated
Onslaughts.
Germany has declared war on Port
ugal. Thus thirteen countries now
are engaged in the international
struggle.
The declaration of war was mado
by Germany chiefly on account of the
recent seizure of German merchant
men interned in Portuguese ports and
' Portugal's refusal to rescind this ac-
tion. A long series of alleged breaches
of neutrality by the Portuguese gov
ernment also were contributing fac
tors. Fighting between the French and
the Germans northwest and north of
Verdun has in no wise slackened.
Particularly violent have been the at
tacks of the Germans to the north of
Verdun, around Douaumont, the vil
lngc of Vaux and Fort Vaux, but,
according to Paris, they went for
naught.
The Germans were thrown in solid
formation against trenches of tho
French bordering on the foot of the
ridge dominating Fort Vaux, which
the latest German official report said
the Germans had captured; but the
French drove back the attacking
forces with "enormous losses."
Northeast of the fort the Germans
essayed an assault against the village
of Vaux, from which they previously
had been driven by the French, but
here, also, they were repulsed, with
heavy casualties.
To the west of the Mouse, midway
between Bethincourt and the river,
the French have continued on the of
fensive in the Corbeaux wood, and
are officially reported to have driven
the Germans from almost all of that
important salient.
In the eastern theater, the Russians
at various points have taken the of
fensive against German advanced
positions, but Berlin declares nowhere
met with success.
The Russians on the Black sea coast
continue to press toward Turkey's
principal port, Trebizond, and also
are making progress against the Otto
mans in the Persian sector.
The Russian foreign office categori
cally denies that Turkey has made
peace proposals of any kind.

Middle of May.

Baptist church Wednesday night, tho
