CONTRACT FOR SEA WALL
At Mass Meeting, Last Saturday, Citizens
Discuss Question Bringing Wall Nearer In
So as to Lessen Cost and Make Expense
Come Within the Funds Available.
The solution of the sea wall prob
lem at Mandeville has engaged the
attention of the citizens for somt
time and a mass meeting was held
last Saturday to devise ways and
means of having it completed. Th'c
great cost and the limited means at
hand, together with the c mplica
tions arising in the adjustment of
the uncompleted contract and the
liability of the bonding company
have made the matter difficult to
handle:
The meelt.ng was presided over by
Mayor Davis and all members of the
council were present excepting Mr
Wills. Mr. Harvey E. Ellis was also
present as legal advisor. Plans were
submitted to modify the sea wall by
bringing it in a little closer, thereby
making the cost come within the

In this state a libelous allegation
is not privileged unless founded on

plaintiff is not required to specially
allege that the defendant knew that

false. It suffices for the plaintiff tI
allege that the charges are false,

KILLED BY CARS
Coroner Bulloch held an inquest,
Thursday morning, on the body of
Curtis ,Ball, colored, the finding of
the jury being .that Ball was run
over by- a train on the tracks of the
New Orleans Great Northern Rail
road. IBall wars employed getting
out railroad ties for the Salmen
Brick and Lumber Company. He
had been in Covington and had
drank some wihile here. It isI
thougt that he attempted to board
an out-going train, missed his foot
ing and was hurled -under it. The
body was terribly mangled and pre
sented a grewsome appearance as it
lay in the undertaking establislument
of Schoen & Molloy. Evidently the
body had been dragged beneath the
cars, where tihe head had been dragg
ed over the ties until it was crushed
and scalped. Bones of the body
were broken and the flesh torn. No
limbs were amputated. The acci
dent occured between Ramsay and
Covington, about a mile and a half
from Covington.

som February 29 a! midnight, after
the closing of the polls, was broug at
f:om the hospital in New Orleans
last S.inday. It was thoqlght at the
time that he had no chance for re

kept -a secret, and newspaper re
porters who visited :McKee at the
New Orleans hospital were unable
to learn anything from him. Since
his return, however, it has been
rumored that Frank Willie was the
guilhy partj. and the fact that a
warrant for his arrest has been is
sued from the sheriff's office shows
that some one o! the thirteen who
were present the night of the cutting
has told what he knows. The cause
of the quarrel still seems to be a
secret and will probably only be
known when the trial comes up. It
is said that McKee had had a fight
preyiously witu one of the Willie
boys and that there had since that
time been a feeling of bitterness
b6tween them. Willie's bond will
probably be placed at $500.

in ý"'Zaza."
The story of the immortal drama,
"Zaza," which has been adapted to a
photoplay by the Famous Players
Film Company, with Pauline Fred
erick the foremost emotional ac
tress of the screen, in the title role,
and which is to appear on the Para
mount program at the Parkview
Theatre Sunday.
Zaza is, a popular singer in one of
the gayest music halls in Paris. She
leads a very tempestuous life and is
much sought after by the beaux of
the town. One night she meets
Bernard, a man about town, behind
the scenes and, after a frivolous
flirtation, falls deeply in love with
him. It is not long 'before he es
tablishes her in an apartment, where
they live happily .for several months.
Her infatuation for Bernard is the
only real and lasting emotion that
Zaza has ever experienced and she
dedicates her whole crude nature to
the task of maklng-'him happy. It
is therefore a terrible blow to her
when she discovers that Bernard is
married and has a little daughter.
Stung to the depths of her savage
nature by the duplicity of the only
man she ever really cared for, Zaza's
first thought is for revenge.
With fiendish accuracy she hits
upon a plan of going straight to the
wife of .Wi bayer .sad announcing
herself as his mistress as the one
best method of obtaining t#he raenge

her ingenuousness and her delightful
generosity so touch the grief-striok.
en Zaza that she cannot find it in
her heart to crush the child udier
the blackening weight of the scan-.
dal which she knows would follow
her through the rest of her life. S ,
it happens that the daughter of Ber
nard saves him from disgrace.
Totally disillusioned, Zaza now
dismisses her lover and returns to
the stage. She soon attains mar
velous popularity and becomes the
idol of Paris. Hearing 'of her trl
umphs, Bernard comes to renew his
attentions to Zaza, and she, in the
supreme struggle of hdr life against
the overwhelming love which she
still has for the man, finally con
quers her own emotions and sends
him back to his wife and child, whia

double life.
Zaza, with Bernard forever di -
missed from her mind, devotes her
life to the drama in which she at
tains the pinnacle of fame.
