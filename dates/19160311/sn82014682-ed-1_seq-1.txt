tion?.". '. ' .v:-t
T Does a provision of the Organic Act
bar legislators' from' commissions' in
the guard? : -'- .f ."'.-'.. ' . ,
h One resrgnation rroin a member of
the legislature, Capt' H. L- Holstein,
was torwaraed lo Governor Pinkham
this incrnins, and it is understood that
ethers may voluntarily follow, even
before the legal aspect of the natter is
cleared up. Capt. Holstein is in the
2nd Infantry on Hawaii. Another offi
cer known to be considering: the same
action is Capt. Charles; A.- Rice, '4th
Infantry, IslancTof KauaL -l . ''' .
CoL Harry A. Baldwin of the 3rd
Infantry, on Maui, is; also one of the
officers whi la a member of the legis
lature. E3 are Capt, Henry B. Penhal
low, "Jrd Infantry, and 1st Lieut Nor
man K. Lyman, 2nd Infantry. ,.Tbe
fcrealns five officers ;are actually
serving with troops. . :' ,i;. -W?
The -section-I -the Organic ; Act
which is causing the trouble is as fol-lows:-
: ; ; .
"Disqualifications of Lesislators. ; "
.'"Section 16. That no member of
the legislature 6hall, during the term
for which he i3 elected. b appointed
or elected to- any office of the Terri
tory cf Hawaii." ;v v -
When Erlg.-gen. Samuel L Johnson,
the adjutant-general and ' also com
manding general of the National
Guard,- was asked this morning for a
statment, he said: v ' ' '
"The interpretation of the law In the
matter of territorial legislators being
officers of the National Guard is be
ing loched into by our Judge-advocate
general,' MaJ. I. IL Stanback.' I do not
care to discuss this feature until he
has rendered an "opinion. s
"However, I will say that it would
be a great , pity to lose some of the
best olflcers in the guard on a mere
technicality, for they receive no re
muneration for their military service
and are working heart and soul for
the good of the guard. . .. : r - -
"It is a srtit pity that others who
are not giving their time and their
efforts, should adopt a destructive
policy, instead of helping tho guard
by even an impassive attitude. How
long the people of the community who
believe in preparedness and In the
work that the guard is doing to make
the Territory of Hawaii an example
to the whole nation, will stand for this
interference ' remains to be seen." . v..
There is understood to be some
doubt whether an officer In the Na
tional Guard would be considered aa
holding an 'office of the Territory of
Hawaii" vlthln the meaning of the act,
or whether, he would be considered as
an officer of part of the forces of the
United States. - .' ' ' -
