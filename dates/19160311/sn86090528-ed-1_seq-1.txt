PREPAREDNESS
WINS; TELL NEWS
TO PRES. WILSON
The wect school has again demon
strated its progressive spirit by teach
ing its students how to debate. ( Fri
day afternoon Principal Meador's
room debated on the question of pre
paredness, and the way the young peo
ple went after the subject and each
other would make high school and col
lodge debaters envious.
Many visitors were present.
Speeches were mad by L. Erlich, Miss
Myers, Mrs. Sanders, Miss G. Davis and
the pupils received them with great
enthusiasm.
The young bebaters were as follows:
Affirmative. Phoebe Heffner, Dorothy
Beizer, Isabel Erlich and Josephine
Hulen.
Negative, Arthur Hinds, Glenn
White, Joseph O'Leary, Wayne Sand
ers. The chairman was P. T. Heffner Jr.,
and the judges were Elizabeth Wat
kins, Edith Cobb and Mrs. G. Mun
ford. The affirmative won with 1,09:
points to 1,081 for the negative. Wayne
Sanders was the best point maker for
the negative, with ajmost a perfect
score. Isabel Erlich scored highest
for the affirmative.
Mr. Meador states that the west
school desires to arrange a triangular
debPte with the north and south
schools, on the question of "Prepar

.ative with one and the negative with

GOOD ROADS
IN DUTTON
LOCALITY
Farmers Volunteer to Keep Up Mile of
Highway and Movement is Success;
Shepard and County Agents
Hold Meetings
County Superintendent Shepard who,
in company with County Agent Cooper
and Mrs. Coryell, the woman agent of
Grady county, has just returned from
a visit to the schools of Dutton town
ship stated this morning that the citi
zens of that section boasted the finest
and best roads to be found in Southern
Oklahoma.
The good roads around Dutton have
been made, Mr. Shepard says, without
advertising and noise of what was be
ing done. Without a big hullabaloo the
farmers first got together and agreed
that good roads should be the slogan
of that community. Then volunteers
came forward and each volunteer took
over and agreed to put in order and
keep in repair one mile of public high-
way. And the work was at once done,
the mile of good road being built.
One r.f the men in Dutton township
who had built hH mile of good road
told Mr. Shepard that after the mile
had been worked the first time and
the roadway completed, ditched at each
side and brought to a crown in the
center, very little work was required
to keep it in the best of shape for the
balance of the year. This gentleman
stated that, exclusive of tho original
grading, one or twa days' work each
month, with a team and a man to help
him, using no machinery except an or
uinary slip or scraper, a plow and a
drag kept the road in good shape.
According to the statements of
Messrs. Shepard and Cooper, the roads
of Dutton towr.ship now seem so gen
erally good that each succeeding mile
traveled seems just a little better than
the one over which the traveler has
just passed.
While on the trip through Dutton
Messrs. Cooper and Shepard and Mrs.
Coryell visited the Liberty, Arcadia
and Pleasant Valley- schools. These
schools were found in the best possible
condition the pupils attentive, the
teachers hard-working and determined
to please the patrons of the school, all
n! whom seem well satisfied with the
work being accomplieshed educational-
At each of the schools the visitors
spoke, Mr. Cooper on agricultural sub
jects and the benefit to ba derived
from well organized boys' clubs; Mrs.
Coryell, on domestic economics and the
great good accomplished through and
by girls' clubs; Mr. Shepard upon ed
ucational matters.
Mr Cooper stated this morning that
as a sequence of this visit he believed
within a short time a number of boys'
and girls' clubs would be organized
throughout the township and that all o!
them would be live wires from the very
start.
At the Dutton chunch, Mr. Cooper
stated, a well defined movement was
under way to effect the organization o!

DANGER TO
BIG DITCH
NOT GRAVE
Panama Canal Will Not Be Swallowed By
Quake or Destroyed By Slides,
Says Expert of Mines
Bureau
ISTHMUS IS RISING
AS OCEAN BED SINKS
Movement Not Rapid Enough to Cause
Trouble; Walls of Culebra Cut Weak
in Places; Gatun Dam '
Will Hold
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 11.
That the Panama canal will not be
swallowed up by an earthquake In tho
future and that the troublesome slides
now being encountered will eventually
be conquered and the great waterway
made an unqualified success, is the
cpinion of Donald F. MacDonald, for
merly geologist and now mining geol
ogist for the United States ibureau of
mines.
Mr. MacDonald, who spent several
years on the, Isthmus making a care
ful study as to frugality of the earth's
crust, has just made an official report
to the effect that, while through seis
ciio disturbances the whole Isthmus
is rising at the rate of three feet every .
hundred years, this will not necessar
ily injure the canal. As far as he
sees, it will merely mean a little ad
ditional expense in the dredging of
the big waterway. The cause of this
rising, he says, is the Unking of tho
ocean bottom outside tho isthmian
shore waters. Every time there Is a
little movement of the ocean bottom,
the isthmus, to be In harmony, joins
in. He also suggests that if the ris
ing motion be rapid, then there would
be serious danger for the canal, but,
that from what has happened in re
cent geologic time, U may be con-
, eluded that the canal is not in any
appreciable danger from the instability
of tl.o isthmian land. The rising of
the isthmus, however, has ibeen re
sponsible for the many slides that have
been encountered, in that the motion
of the ground has dislocated and crush
ed the rocks, leaving them weak and
unstable.
"At any rate," says Mr. MacDonald,
"so far as the digging of the Culobra
tut Is concerned, these faults have in
creased the cost of the canal several
million dollars,
"As to the slides, Culebra cut is
a vast ditch that passes through many
varieties of rock In the nine miles o
its length. Some of these are weak
and unstable, and where the slopes
of the cut were steep and 300 to 30O
feet high the weaker rocks crushed
down to flatter slopes. Whenever the
slope got flat enough, the sliding stop
ped. At no time did the engineering
staff constructing the canal believe
that the slides were a menace to the ul
timate completion and successful oper
ation of the canal, in spite of the fact
that at times they were somewhat
troublesome. They have made neces
sary the excavation of about 30,000,000
lubic yards more than was included
n the first estimate: for Culebra cut,
but they have not in the past and will
not in the future endanger the ultimate
success of the canal."
Mr. MacDonald calls attention to
the fact that one Is apt to forget that
the greatest-variation of atmospheric
pressure near sea level may be more
than four million tons per square
mile and that it the adjustment of at
mospheric pressure, in a very large
cave or mine lags behind any quick
Increase in atmospherio pressure at
the surface, a considerable strain may.
be added to the roof of such an exca
vation. Discussing the real cause of
the slides, Mr. MacDonald declare
that in many cases the immediate
cause was the oversteepness and
height of the slopes, the blasting and
other work attributable only to man.
He adds that the geologic condition
were not svfticiently considered In tho
