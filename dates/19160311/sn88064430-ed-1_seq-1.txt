go, who now is engaged in turning
out aniline dyes in New Orleans. Mr.
E %allior's small but efficient plant at
M1M ('arondelet street is visited daily
by many people interested in his work.
It is a revelation to some tliat "Ger
man efficiency" can be duplicated in
this country.
"Why shouldn't we be able to make
aniline dyes in this country?" asml.
ingly asked Mr. Wallior. "I presun:e,.
ED due to the lack of acquaintance with
our own resources and possibilities.
most people belief we are dependent
entirely upon Europe for certain
y the things.
ble "The truth of the matter is, Louis
iana has the four principal ingred
ients entering into the aniline formu
la. in unlimited quantities. There is
no possibility of the supply becoming
es.- exhausted, and it is only a question
itsleu of time when we will be one of the
aychemical centers of the United
farm States."
robs. Mr. Wallior explained that the basis
1tent of aniline dye is sulphur, oil, salt and
en lime. Louisiana has oceans of oil and
s a almost inexhaustible supplies of the
less other three elements. Another ad
will vantage enjoyed by New Orleans,
ifrom a chemical manufacturing stand
ally point, is its proximity to the source
of supply, he said.
sand When the supply of aniline dyes be
gan to lessen, a few months after the
aore outbreak of the European war, Mr.
ar Wallior applied his knowledge to mak
tedng an American product equally as
ast goad. He received more orders for
:ton the dyes than he can supply as a re
suit of his enterprise. lie has suc
cessfully manufactured blue, brown,
ted black, yellow, red and several other
colors.
The local manufacturer attributes
the inconvenience now experienced by
American manufacturers, entirely to
the lack of foresight. He says we I
of- have proven our ability to supply our I
own needs under any condition and f
ling that Louisiana can supply aniline dyes t
r- for the rest of the world.
Judging by the favorable letters i
brought to the Association of Com-.
merce by the local chemist, the New c
to Orleans product has proven satisfac- a
ci tory in every way. It is possible that t
the result of Mr. Wallior's experiment a
se will give an impulse to chemical in- a
dustries in Louisiana. a

e.- London.-Keen disappointment as
wn, to the results of recruiting under the
ther voluntary scheme proposed by him
was expressed in the House of Lords
utes by the earl of Derby, former chief o:
d by the recruiting service.
to The earl laid the chief blame for the
we failure to achieve full results at which
our he aimed to the easy exemptions of
and single men, belonging especially to
yes the starred trades-men required ti
work on necessities required by the
ters government-and agriculturists. Hell
om- made an emphatic plea to the govern
Kew ment to prevent bachelors of military
fac- age from evading military service by
that transferring themselves to specialized
ent occupations and declared that a
in- strong effort was necessary to obtain
a requisite number of fighting men,
without whom the empire might fall.
lest Agriculturalists, the earl of Derby
the said, were the principal class to avail
en- themselves of exemption under the
!ing plea that they were indispensable for
is the production of foodstuffs and that
hop such exemptions should be watched.
will Baron Harris, who has large farm in
rat terests, expressed the opinion that no
be single man was necessary on a farm.
gbh No figures as to the result of the
will recruiting campaign were given, but
in it was announced that 140,000 mar
rne Ned men had attested under the earl u
lye of Derby's scheme since the begin
ta ing of the year. The government e
ph promises to revise the list reserved 0
trades with a view to releasing more i
men for the army. o
on The chief question for considera
., tion, said the earl of Derby, was the c
ad- position of starred occupations, at the it
number of which he was very much P
alarmed. al
