FIGHT IS NOW RAGING
AT DEAD MAN'S HILL
Ruthless Tactics of Crown;
Prince Turn Meuse Val
ley Into a Bloody
Shambles
International News Stfviro:
PAULS, March 11. When the
great battle of Verdun swung Into
the 20th day of its existence today
the Germans wer still far from
victory, although they are delivering
savage artillery attacks on both
sides of the Meue river in an f
fort to dislodge the French from Le
Mort Homme (dead man's hill) and
Fort IH Vaux.
French military experts declare
that the slight advance by the Ger
mans on Friday in Corbeaux forest
must be regarded as a glaring piece
of tactical folly when the enormous
price Is taken Into consideration. It
is estimated that the Germans lost
10,000 men in the fighting in Cnr
neaux woods and elsewhere on Fri
day. One of the facts that stand out,
as regards the operations around
Verdun on Friday is the fury and
magnitude of the assault of the Ger
mans against Corbeaux forest. The
German crown prince had been us
ing from 5,000 to 6.000 men in an
effort to dislodge the French from
the forest without success. Finally
in desperation he launched a colos
sal attack with 23. 000 of his best
troops against the French lines af
ter a violent bombardment of six
hours.
The most that this enormous force
was able to accomplish in the f .re
of the French artillery and Infantry
opposing it was an advance of fi im
200 to ."00 yards into the French
lines alone a front of less than a
mile.
The defense of Corbeaux wood.
which guards the flank of the
French position on Goose hill, was
directed by Gen. Castclnau, the
French chief-of-staff, and Gen.
Tetaln.
The German losses were enormous
and all nicht long trains, the cars
of which were painted a briKht red.
sped back toward interior Germany
laden with nude corpses of soldiers
for cremation.
The Temp's, basing the statement
upon Information from a semi-official
source, Indultes that the Ger
man losses ha- averaced 10,000 a
day during the 20' days of the bat
tle. The ruthless tactics of the crown
prince has turned the Meuse valley
into a bloody shambles. French
military men speak of the German
tactics as "mere butchery' of men.
"Let the good work of the French
Troops continue," writes Tieut. Col.
Kousset. one of the foremost French
military critics. "Our adversary has
been pushed to the extreme disre
gard of human life by stern neces
sity. Our tactics permit of no such
freightful butchery. We throw Into
hatle only such forces as are neces
sary to withstand the shock, keeping
reserved Intact lepion which will
jrweep forward in tinal victory. In
nur prudent opposition to the crown
prince's maniacal fury I .see the con
summation of our highest hopes."
Many French wounded arrived
frcm the battlefield throughout the
r.Jght. They declared that the
French soldiers on the bring line
nre confident and that the morale of
the army has not been shaken.
Hrnov Violent A-aults.
German troops renewed their
violent assaults on the Verdun front
we.t of the Meuse during the night.
They were able to ain some ground
in the opening .uss-aults. but an im
mediate counter attack by the
French drove them back.
This otticial information is given
in the war nf√ºcc cotnmuni ue issued
this afternoon. whi-h al state
that the Germans have redoubled
their efforts on the eist bank of the
Meuse between Vaux and the ridge
nearby. Fort fe Vaux was aNo
bombard ed.
The text of the otticial communique-
follows:
"After bombarding our positions
between Tyron and Berry-a-Uuc.
north of the A is re, for several hours
yesterday the German debauched
from Ville-au-Fl is and attacked th
salients which form our line at Hois
fs Butles. After a ven sharp

Internntlonal New Serrlre:
WASHINGTON, March 11. Th
United States, for the first time in
its history. Is actively pre-parinsr to
conserve the nation's food supplies,
it was learned today. To this mvI
a vigorously propaganda conducted
by various government departments
shortly will be launched.
Farmers will be urged to aban
don to a greater or lersr extent 'ho
raising of cotton and other staple
products and to use the ground for
th" pr d' ".tior. of food crops.
Th'1 government's action, it was
sail -.y a high otlicial today, has.
been didd on after an extensive
i.tudy of conditions brought about
by the Kuropean war. With the relation--
between tit.- country and
several nations straining towards
the breaking point, it was felt that
some action looking to Internal pre
paredness should be taken. The ad
ministration feels, it was said,
that in th event of war with any
of thr first class powers of the
wot M. tnis government can count on
no nation to aid it.

WASHINGTON. March 11.
Henry Gassoway Davis, former
I'nlteil States senator from "West
Virginia and democratic candidate
for vice president in 1904. died at
his home here early today. He was
93 years old. Death resulted fron
an attark of irrij. complicated ty in
firmities of old age.
The funeral of Mr. Davis will
probably be heia at Elkins, W. Va,
his home for many years. W'hilo
definite arrangements have not been
completed It vas Ftated that the
funeral probably would take place
tomorrow or Monday.
Henry Gassoway Davis' re-mark-ahle
career is a distinct encourage
ment to the eugenlsts who believe
men should live in health a century.
When h" ran for the vice presi
dency, the oldest candidate ever
known for that office., there was
f-ome criticism on this score. If
Mr. Davis had be?n elected, the end
of his term would have found him
strong mentally and physically,
and, indeed, a second and even third
term of office would have pas&crt
with his mind and body still un
daunted. Mr. Davis was born in Baltimore,
Nov. '16, 1S2-. and received a
meager education in public schools.
At a very earlv age he was hard at
work. He was the eldest of rive
children, and the death of his fath
er, Caleb ITivis, made him the fam
ily breadwinner. -
While the younrcr childrtn con
tinued In school, he toiled with his
lands, and later with his bra'ns, to
support them. At 19 he was only a
farm hand on a Maryland planta
tion. A few years later he lad ad
vanced to a hrakeman on the prim
itive freipht train of that tim His
rise in railroading- was rapid. Tie
was soon master of transportation
nnd is said to have be n the firM
man to risk sending out trains be
tween Faltimore and Cumberland
at ni-'ht.
Ilocomo Mrrehant.
Young Davis saved his money
and became a merchant and coal
land operator. His many ventures
prospered exceedingly. His oal
lands rose to almost fabulous valuer.
He was also successful as .a rail
road builder. Two of his lines werf?
the West Virginia Central & Pitts
burgh railway, which he sold to tho
Wabash in 1902. and the Coal &
Coke railway of West Virginia.
As far back as 1SS3. the year he
civil war ended, he entered public
life. lie was n member of the house

Second Choice Votes Not Suf

International Now Srvio:
INDIANAPOLIS, March 11. Sec
ond choice votes in the state-wide
primary of last Tuesday will not be
sufficient to nominate Harry S. New
of Indianapolis, as republican can
didate for United States senator.
This was evident today when all
but six precincts fit the state had
been heard from on first choice
votes and one-fourth of the state had
been heard from on the second
choice. The first choice votes show i
New is leading: James TZ. Watson by
a plurality of S.000. The second
choice votes indicate that Watson
and New are running even. So even
should New get an even split in
the second choice votes he would
not have a majority over Watson.
The contest will likely go to the
state republican convention in April.
Pecause of the confusion in count
ing the second choice votes in many
counties of the state it was not
known today when the official re
turns would be complete. Many
recounts have been necessary.
