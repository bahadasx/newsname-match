A well known Frenchman
who has just returned from the
battlefield east of Verdun says
that the sublime self-sacrifice of
Gen. Petain's men fer their
country is Spartan-like.
Before going intt action the
troops destroy all letters and
consign their treasured souve
nirs to relatives with a brief
note. These farewell missives
are distinguished by their brev
ity. Some examples follow:
"Think well of me; I have
died for dear France."
"Bring up my children- to
love France; farewell, dear
wife;, we shall meet in the Be
yond."
"I go to my death cheerfully,
because I am convinced the
Bosches will never get Ver

Paris. March 10.-The battle of 10.000
guns and 500,000 bayonets still rages furl
ously in the Meuse Valley. The nine
teenth day of the conflict brought no
perceptible diminution in the desperate
encounter.
Tens of thousands of melinite and
eheddite continue to be exchanged be
tween the French and German. The bat
tie still ebbs and flows around a few dis
puted villages, woods and hills.
t'xclurlve information allows an esti
mate that the German casualties may

-mon. This includes a considerable num
ber of prisoners. although the French
staff policy forbids mention of the figure.
Never has a sterner call been made on
the heroism of French Infantrymen;
never have they answered the call in a
finer spirit.
When the Corbeaux woods were recap
tured from the Germans there were in
numerable Instances of heroism by the
chasseurs. One officer said:
"I never have seen men fight with such
bloody frenzy. Any weapon served. ITf a
shell shattered a man's bayonet he leaped
at the enemy with a clasp knife. Every
infantryman who esevs0d the German
machine gun fire fought like a .omnan
legionary in hand-to-hand encounters, In
which the superiority of the Frenchman
over the Germans was clearly demon
strated.
Sergeant's Squad Captures Gun.
"A sergeant and twenty men volun
teered to seize a machine gun posted at
a dangerous angle in the woods, from
which it raked the onsweeping French.
The small body succeeded in reaching the
gun. killed the Teuton team and turned
the weapon upon the Germans, killing
them like flies.
"The fury of their fighting can be un
derstood when I say that not one of
these twenty-one lost his life. We cleared
most of the wood within an hour.'
Similar daring deeds were being per
formed at the same time by other French
troops on the other side of the Meuse.

El Paso, March 10.-Five hundred Amer

Villa to attack the train on which they
are en route to the border.
The Mormons are residents of colonies
in the Galeana district. When news of
the Columbus massacre reached them
they at once made preparations to return
to the United States. Information reach
ing here tonight is to the effect that
Villa has sent 2,000 of his troops to Gus.

Dispatches from Blabee stated that a
band of 200 Mexicans crossed the border
southeast of Osborne Junction, Ariz.,
killed an American ranchman and drove
off many head of live stock. The name
of the ranchman has not been learned.
Sounds of rifle firing late tonight in the
vicinity of Columbus, N. Mex., created
great excitement in that town tonight.
I'or a time it was feared that Villistas
were about to make a fresh attack.
Telephone messages later stated that
several Mexicans had been killed by
civilian residents of Columbus, who,
wrought up by Thursday's massare, are
hunting down all suspicious Meuians.
Amether Teeper Dead.
The Columbus death list was .e
creased to eighteen this evening when
Private Jesse P. Tayler, Troop F, Thir
teenth Cavalry, died from a bullet
wound in the head at Fort Bliss Hos
pital.
That Carranza intends to assist the
United States in its announced de
termination to hunt down Villa and
bring him in "alive or dead," was in
dicated tonight by the arrival of 1.200
Carranza troops at Paloma, six miles
south of Columbus. They carried a
special flag to distinguish them from
Villistas so that the American troop
would not fire.
The Mormon colonists in peril in
Chihuahua consist of men, women and
children who have been engaged in
farming in the Casas Grandes dis
trict.
Officials of the Mormon Church here
and at Salt lake City co-operated to
day in seeking assistance for these
persons. It was arranged that a spe
cial train should leave Casas Grandes
for El Paso. When this train will
start is not known here. A train on
the Northwestern Railroad was due to
leave Casas Grandes tonight, and it is
believed that many Americans have
taken passage on it. It is the train
which Villa is reported to be prepar
ing to attack.
Carransa Nen to Guard Road.
Bishop Iturst. the Mormon prelate here,
today held a lengthy conference with
Gen. Gavira, commanding the Carranzias
tas at Juarez, and asked that a military
escort atcompany the train.
Consul Garcia. the Carranzista repre
entaUve here, told Bishop lturst later
that 2,000 Carranza soldiers have left
Chihuahua for Juarez and that they will
proceed to Cases Grandes and patrol the
railroad north in order to protect for
eigners who are fleeing to-the border.
Villa has always displayed hatred for
the Mdrmons in Mexico. whom he ac
cused of having aided the Federals dur
ing the campaign against Huerta, and
the fact that he was informed of the
plan to bring them to El Paso indicates
that he has a well-established secret
servime both in this country and other
border poiats. He was notified of the
Mormon movement sooner than it was
made public here.
The main body of Villa's army, accord
ing to reports reaching Columbus today,
is at Bloca Grande, twenty-five miles
southeast of Columbus. thIs mtorning.

Texas Governor Praises
Pmrsit Of Bandits
Spidsl to The Wa n erei ld.
Austin, Tex., March 10.-Hearty
approval of the administration's
course in sending troops across the
border was expressed today by
Gov. Ferguson in the following
signed statement:
BY JAMES E. FERGUSON.
Governor of Texas.
Replying to your request for an
expression of my views on the
massacre of Columbus, N. Mex.,
and the action of our government
in sending troops into Mexico. I
beg to say I am not wholly sur
prised at its occurrence.
For months we have known that
In the present condition of our
border defenses, our country might
be visited with such afflictions as
this at most any time or place.
For this reason I have strongly
urged the President's policy of
preparedness and this present out
rage will amply illustrate how
necessary it is for our people to
become alive to the real situation
and demand that we suffer no
longer from an inadequate army.
While a great deal is being said
about people who leave home, let
us not forget that in obedience to
our national honor, we must pro
tect those who stay at home.
I heartily approve the action of
the President in sending the troops
across the border to catch the
guilty bandits.
The question of intervention may
be avoided, but if it becomes neces
sary in order to protect lives on
American soil, then let it come.
However, let us keep cool and
deal with that question when we
get to it. Let us prepare to be
prepared.
Slocum's Troopers
OnlyAwait Orders
All Columbus Under Arms
Prepared to Resist An

Columbus, N. M., March 10.-Col. Ii. J.
Slocum Is waiting orders to move his
cavalry into Mexico.
News that the administration at Wash
ington had decided to avenge the Amen
cans slain By Villa in his attack on Co
lumbus Thursday morning caused tre
mendous excitement here. Military men
are confident that with re-enforcmnts of
cavalry, thy will be able to round up
Villa and his band in short order.
It is estimated that Villa has under his
command about 2".:1 men. This estimate
is made by Major Frank Tompkins who,
with little more than 20 American cav
alrymen, pursued the bandits for fifteen
miles into Mexico yesterday.
Columbus is an armed city tonight.
Every man and boy is carrying a rifle
and side arms. Many are eager to join
with the troops in the campaign against
Villa.
Rumors that Villistas were again near t
the town planing to attack led to hasty
extinguishing of lights tonight about 7:30.
Troops were sent out to investigate and
returned with the information that no r
Mexicans were in the vicinity.
In the eastern outskirts of Columbus to- t
night a Mexican who failed to halt at the
order of a sentry was shot and instantly i
killed. t
