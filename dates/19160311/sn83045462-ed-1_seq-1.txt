I*atest reports of the whereabouts of r?
Gen. Villa say he reached L.a Ascension,
south of Palomas, some time yesterday P'
fi
with 300 followers after his flight following
the attack on Columbus. This
information reached hero today in a s<
message to the Carranza embassy from K
Consul Andreas Garcia at KI Paso.

P.ertani also reported Villa had sixty J*'
casualties in the encounter with the -A\
American troops at Columbus and the P
pursuit which followed. On the day ^
following the Columbus battle Villa A'
avoided an encounter with the troops
of Gen. Bertani, w ho reported that the j .A\
American Mormon colonists ar e in no. b<

T.ast night's report gave Gen. Villa's
force as 3.000, but that is believed to j ai
include sympathizers in his territory. |
By his movement southeast it was > *\

thought a threatened attack on the j <
American Mormon colony at CasasL
Grandes has passed for the present. ni
The strictest secrecy was being observed
by War Department officials to- tr
day regarding the army's plans for the s<
capture of the bandits. This is in ac- s'
cordance with the urgent request of
Gen. Funston, the object being to prevent
Villa from learning of the movements
of the expedition.
Secretary Baker today referred to ("
the American expedition as a "defen- ei
ive" one. This was regarded as a sig- 1,1
niflcant indication of the adminlstration's
policy to make it cle^r that it is en
proceeding with scrupulous regard for

Senator Smoot of Utah received telegrams
today from Mormon leaders

of Casas Grandes. The colonists want

took up the question with the War n
Department, and was assured that a
everything possible would be done to H(

The ambassadors from Chile and 11

Many Offer to Volunteer.
Many dispatches were received from
en. Funston today, informing, the
ipartment as to the disposition he was
laking of his forces at strategic
Dints.
Secretary Baker said that whatever
iinforcements (Jen. Funston might reuire
to maintain an adequate patrol

force would be promptly
ir nished.
He added that the War Department
id been deluged with telegrams from

Pershing Likely to Command.
The War Depart merit has not ariDunced
whether Gen. Funston will
ad the expedition in person, but it is
?lievrd that he will not. It is said in
igh official circles, however, that in
1 probability Brie. Gen. John .1
ershing. commanding the Sth Rriade
at Fort Bliss, will lead the first
id the largest expedition against
ilia.
It was pointed cut. that several pares
might be sent from various pointslong
the border, and that there would
e several commands under as many
aders. Gen. Funston commands all

in the expeditions or upon patrol

Gen. Funston confirmed today official
the killing of Pablo Lopez. Villa's
lief lieutenant, during the raid on
oluinbus. and also the report that

Unofficial information at Fort Sam

Villa at La Ascension.
Villa is reported today to be at La
Ascension, on the Mexican Northwestern
railroad. 100 miles southwest of El
Paso. He is said to have only 200 or
300 men with him and to be short of
ammunition.
Gen. Funston remained at southern
department headquarters until the
early hours of this morning:, directing:
the work of a score of men, receiving:
and filing: telegraphic orders to border
points in connection with the punitive
expedition into Mexico.
Two companies of infantry were ordered
to Deming, N. M., on receipt of
urgent representations from citizens of
that town asking protection.
Orders to Mobile Forces.
SAN FRANCISCO, March 11.?All
mobile troops in the western department
have been ordered to hold themselves
in readiness to proceed to the
Mexican border.
The mobile troops in the department
are the 21st Infantry, at Vancouver
barracks: a battalion of the T4th Infantry,
at Fort Wrig;ht, Spokane; a
battalion of the 14th Infantry, at Fort
Lawson, Seattle; six troops of the 1st

Villa in Position to Cut
Off Escape of 500 Mormon
Colonists to U. S. Border
Kb PASO. Tex.. March 11.?The position
of th?* 500 members of the Mormon
farming: colony in th*- t'asas
Grandes district. Chihuahua. 158 miles
by train from El Paso, critical as it
was in the first place, was further
menaced today by the presence of
Francisco Villa with a band of 300 followers
at I .a Ascencion. close to the
ailroar! over which they must travel
to the Ameiican frontier.
The train which was to carry out the 1
Mormons to the border has riot started I
j and will not start until a sufficient escort. I
I arrives from the garrison at ( lnhuahua
I City, according: to (Jen. (Javira. com!
manding at Juarez, today.
' The topography of the country near
La Ascencion. however, affords protection
should Villa attack the train.
Reported Short of Ammunition.
In El Paso hope for the escape of the
| Mormons is based largely on the unI
verified rumor that Villa is short of
| ammunition. Although only 300 men
I are reported to be with him at La Aej
cencion. Villa is said to have a force
of 2,000 in that region.
| The arrest of aTiumber of well known
! Villa agents by the El Paso police
early today included a general, who
was trying to buy arms in a gun
store; a colonel, who was found in the
general's home, and an alleged spy
with penciled maps of Mexican railways
in his pocket.
La Constitucion, a local Mexican
paper, has been suspended by the police
and all editions seized because of an
inflammatory article against the United
States.
Ammunition Wagons Pursued.
The military authorities at Fort Bliss
received word that a large quantity of
rifle munition was taken from a place
of concealment in the Mexican quarter i
I early today and placed in a wagon train
I presumably bound for Villa's camp. As
i the wagons could not have crossed the
| international bridge, the pursuit of the
| soldiers in automobiles took place on
! the road that follows the boundary on
; the American side. No trace of the arnj
munition has yet been found.
Traffic over the international bridge
between the Mexicans on both sides of
the boundary, usually large, has decreased
materially. Horse racing still
goes on in Juarez, but the attendance
from the El Paso side is less than half
the normal. At night heavy guards are
placed on patrol along the boundaryand
at the smelter, the light plant and
other points open to attack.
Carranza Troops Spreading
a Net to Head Off Villa,
Carry a Distinctive Flag
COLUMBUS. N. M., March 11.?The
disposition of the troops of the Carranza
government in the states of
Chihuahua and Sonora within the last
twenty-four hours indicated that a
i
concerted effort bad been started to
corner Villa in northwest Chihuahua.
Gen. Calles at Agua Prieta said he
had disposed his forces along the railroad
from Nacozari to guard the mountain
passes through which Villa and
his forces might be expected to pass
westward into Sonora.
Gen. Calles, with 200 mounted men, j
moved eastward from Agua Prieta, !
aiming to secure that side of the trap j
which is being laid to capture the out- j
lawed chieftain to the east.
i
To Complete the Net.
Two detachments of mounted men
from the forces of Qen. Gabriel Gavira
at Juarez are reported moving in conjunction
with Calles' troops to complete
the eastern side of the net. The
forces of Gen. Guiterrez of Chihuahua
were guarding against a southward
movement by Villa and his column.
The Carranza troops, it was stated,
carried a black-and-white flag to
notify the American troops of their
identity.
Movements of U. S. Cavalry.
Advices from the west stated that
the entire 7th Cavalry, under Col. Erwin,
had left Hachita for Culbertson's
ranch on the border.
A troop of cavalry was reported en j
route from Douglas, Ariz., to Hachita. j
One troop of 7th Cavalry was sent to
Alamo Hueco, ten miles south of
Hachita. There were American cav- j
alrymen also at Dog Springs guarding1
all routes across the boundary in that!
section of New Mexico. j
Other United States troops were disposed
as follows: First battalion. 20th j
Infantry, at Victoria, thirty-two miles;

der gate three miles south of Coltim- J
bus; six troops. 13th Cavalry, in camp!

Here Is the Prize Letter.
I "l>ear Colleague:
I "The statement that salaries in th?
j government service in Washington ha*?
not been changed for fifty-six years i.false.
Every appropriation bill carries
a number of increases and promotions
and the work is constantly readjusted.
"The statement that salaries are. adjusted
on a seven-hour day is false
Clerks are paid for a full day.
"The clerks have thirty days* vacation;
thirty days' sick leave and all th?
holidays. They work 238 Va days oul
of the year or an average of less than
twenty days a month. This is equivalent
to only 208 Vi full days of eighl
hours, or days a month.
"Civil service employes outside ol
Washington work eight hours and only
- have fifteen days' vacation, and man)
of them work Sundays and holidays
"There are 470.366 civil service employes
in the United States. Thirtyfour
thousand four hundred and thirty
ara in Washinclnn and nre treated an a
privileged class. Thus 7 per cent ol
the government employes do all the
bellyaching. The other 93 per cent
work and ask no favors.
"The merchants and landlords of
Washington are for more government
clerks, extravagance and inefficiency.
"The American taxpayer is for an
honest day's work for an honest day's
pay.'
"Are you for the financial interests
of Washington or for the taxpayers of
the Union?
"Very truly yours.
"WILLIAM P. BORLAND."
Calls Clerks Leisure Class.
The second letter:
"Dear Colleague:
"If we spend without adequate return
four or Ave million dollars of the
peoples funds, primarily for the departinental
clerks, but ultimately and
really for the benefit of the mercantile
interests of Washington, where are we
to get the money? It must be laid
upon the American people as a tax
burden in some form. We are not
spending money we have already raised
?that would be wrong enough?but
we must hdnestly and wisely face the
problem of raising money for vital national
expenses. Only a demagogue
will vote for appropriations and refuse
to vote for taxes. Can we justify
laying a tax upon the farmers, business
men and wage earners of the
country to pay for the privilege of
having a leisure class in Washington7
"Whose rights are paramount?those
of the man who supports the government.
or the man who is supported by
it?
"Does the farmer work seven hours
a day?
"Does the wage earner work seven
hours a day?
"Does the merchant work seven
j hours a day?
"Lets give the American taxpayer
ja square deal?heaven knows he needs
it! Very truly yours.
"WILLIAM P. BORLAND."
Why Do Merchants Oppose ItP*'
The third letter:
"Deal- Colleague:
"If the eight-hour law for. government
clerks will not save money for
the government why are the merchants
and landlords of Washington opposing
it? They know that it will cut at least
$4,000,000 a year ofT Uncle Sam's pay
roll.
"All the money the clerks get finds its
way into the pockets of the merchants
and landlords. They pick the bones of
the clerks clean. Are they friends of
labor? Are they against an eight-hour
day on high moral grounds? Why don't
they give a seven-hour day to their
own employes? Why did they oppose so
bitterly an eight-hour day for woman
wage workers in Washington? Ask
these department store keepers who
now want your vote.
"The land speculator, too, wants your
vote. If the government hires more
clerks than it needs in order to work
them less than a full business day, our
real estate friend can sell them houses
on the installment plan. The merchants
and farmers back home pay the salaries
that buy these houses.
"Also it takes more office space for
a large number of clerks working
seven hours than for a smaller number
working eight hours. Much of this
space must be rented from private
owners. The government pays $36,000
a year for the quarters now occupied
by the Attorney General. In all It
pays out about $700,000 a year in rent
in Washington. All of the saving in
space will reduce this item.
"The financial and mercantile interests
of Washington have bullied and
villifled Congress They call us salary
grabbers, mileage grafters, pork barrel
thieves. If we are bullied into voting
for this hogshead of pork for them are
we not all that they say we are?
