BULLETIN!
Washington, March 11. Despite the fact that high depart
ment officials late this afternoon said they did not believe the
expedition into Mexico had started. Chairman Hay of the house
military committee said, after leaving a conference with Secre
tary of War Baker, "I believe our troops are now well across
the border on their way to run down Villa and his bandits."

for troop I, Thirteenth cavalry, to be in readiness to start for
the border in the event orders to move are received from the
war department at Washington. Troop I is the only line organ

on the border.
Kill 3 More Mexicans.
Torreon, Mex., March 11. Ten Villa generals in command
of only 100 men recently raided San Juan Gaudalupe in Zacate
cas and captured a German named Weiner, whom they held
for ransom at 10,000 pesos. His compatriots here raised the
money and he was released. As soon as Weiner was freed, Gen
eral Gonzale, in command of the Carranza troops sent a bri
gade under General Elizondo in pursuit. Three Villa men were

Reports on Villa.
El Paso, March 11. Reports indicate that Villa is still in
the neighborhood of Ascension, within easy striking distance
of the railway over which the refugees must pass on their way
to the American frontier. General Gavira received word that
General Gutierrez, in command at Chihuahua City, disposed
forces from 300 to 900 men at San Geronimo, Santa Clara,
Guerrero and Laguna, in order to block Villa's progress at
those points, reserving a mobile force of 500 from which the
escort for the Mormon train will be taken. General Bertani is
holding his force intact at Palomas near the northern frontier,
as it is not large enough to risk division. He will protect Amer
ican interests there.

jfor the first time in the history

That the 'planes will be of mark
ed advantage in seeking" out the

cessible hiding- places in the
I mountains to which the bandits
j probably will be pursued before
caught, and likewise the desert
wastes which offer terrible resis

The aeroplanes will serve principal
ly as scouts, seeking out the hiding
