THE BALL.
At half past eight o'clock a mag
nicent torch light procession, bead
ed by two bands, proceeded with c
the Royal party in automobiles to E
the Bonin Hall where a magnifi
cent reception was held by the
King and his faithful subjects, the ti
Royal party entered the hall while R
a march was being played by three o
bands combined, making an or-I
chestra of more than seventy five
members, which also furnished the
music for the Royal dances, after
which all were invited to join in
the dancing, this was as fine a ball
as was ever given here.
The King was Dr. L. G. Flem- c
ins; and his Queen, the charming t,
Miss Verna Knight, and she was
sweet and lovely in her Queenly t,
robes. The Dukes and Dutchesses
were Leonard Resweber and Miss
Delia Bulliard, Arthur Gaudin and tl
Miss Lorena Labbe, Dr. C. E. Si
11111,n and Miss Lucille Simon, Wal.
do Labbe and Miss Alice Goulas.
We make special study of diag
enostic methods both laboratory and
clinical (physical,) especially as
an aid to the general practitioner,
we therefore, accept no general T
case, unless the attending physi- ,
cian go on a strike and leave his c
patient to the ravages of the dis- r
ease, then we back our hand. t'
Our prices are within the reach G
of everyone, we say this to discre- c
dit the rumors of the exorbitant a
charges accredited to us. If you ti
doubt this come and get your in
formation from us, instead of get
ting it second-hand or from some
one who may have an ex to grind.
The following has been printed
on our price list since we started
working here: "Whenever patients
are unable to pay, or are strictly
charity patients. any reduction re-.
quested by the physician or clergy
mao, will be made. This rule,
however, must not be abused.
Respectfully,
J. A. AZAR, M. D.

animals are vaccinated against
charbon early in the Spring so as
to allow thirty days in which to
secure protection before the season
approaches, when charbon infec
tion usually develops.
The State Live Stock Sanitary
Board strongly urges, therefore,
that, in those sections of the State
in which charbon infection has
been'known to exist in previous
years. vaccination of animals
should commnience no later thanI
March 1st. That is. the first dol0l,
ot a double dose vaccine, should be
given at that time.
If stock owners will give this
matter their careful attention. it
will increase the numlbr of Ipr,
tected animals at the beginning of
the chlarbon season, anld materially
limit the spread of tile disease.
Sshould tile coming Sumnner prove
favorable to the develpment if
charbon infection.
