ed as beyond all proportions to the
objective they sought, have occupied

wesl of (he iMeuse and northwest of
Verdun, according to the French offi­
cial communication announced to­
night.
Germans' Charge Checked.
'Hermans attacked to the west, of
the village of Douaumon! and against
the village of Vaux were put down
iby the French. Berlin, however, coun­
ters lhis assertion, by announcing the
taking of a bridge west of Douaumont
by ,the Germans, and Bays also that
tjift' Germans have succeeded in put­
ting forward*thfeir lines through the
wooded sector southeast of Damloup,
which lies a short distance east of

sailed from New York, February 4,
bound for Havre, has been sunk.
Three members of the crew were

No Excitement.

declaration of war on Portugal evok­
ed hardly more than passing interest
there.

leave Berlin tonight on a special
train, placed at his disposal by the
government.
Spain's ministers at Lisbon have
been charged with the interests of
the Portuguese consulate.
Denounce Rich Dress.
The National Organization Commit­
tee of War has issued an appeal
against "extravagance in women's
dress," which says that while many
women have recognized that elabora­
tion and variety in dress is bad form
in the present crisis, there are still
a large number, both among the
rich and those not so well to do, as
the war appears to have made little
difference with their apparel.

formerly first lord of the admiralty,
intends to resign his commission in
the army and return to parliament.

that it was prepared to ship immed­

This action was taken within an
hour after receipt of word from
Washington that American troops
had been ordered into Mexico to cap­
ture Francisco Villa.
Captain Sims of the Nevada Says
That Old Vessels Are No

MISTAKES IN DESIGN
GVEN AS REASON
Washington, (March 10.—America's
three dreadnoughts fleet would go
over like ninepins if pitted against
British or other craft of thu same
age, Captain S. W. Sims, commander
of the hew superdreudnought, Neva­
da, told the house naval committee
today, because "colossal mistakes"
in construction have never been rec­
ti lied. Other countries, he said, had
spent millions of dollars in redesign­
ing Ihe older r.liips to meet changed
conditions.
Oregon Worst Naval Design.
Illustrating his point, Captain Sims,
who as lieutenant went over I lie herul
of his superior to obtain President
Roosevelt's support in his campaign,
to improve methods of target prac­
tice in the navy, said the old bulldog
of the navy, the battleship, Oregon,
was the worst naval design ever put
afloat. Her unbalanced turrets heel­
ed the ship down on sog-side lire, he
said, until close in the armor plate

Washington, March 10.—(From un­
official. hut reliable, sources it was
learned today that the long standing
case of the American packers, involv­
ing the detention by the British gov­
ernment of large quantities of meat
products shipped from the United
States to the neutral countries of
northern Europe has been adjusted.
While details of the settlement are
lacking, it is known the British gov­
ernment has undertaken to secure
the exporters against the loss by a
system of a long time contract.
Weather Bureau Reports Danger
From Floods Along the Big
Muddy.
Orris W. 'Roberts, section director
of the weather bureau for .North Da­
kota and Montana, gives the follow­
ing report of the conditions along the
Missouri river:
The recent cold snap lessened to a
certain extent the immediate danger
of an overflow of the Missouri river
atthis place. The serious floods at
Yankton and adjacent points are the
result of the unusual flow of water
for this time of the year that has
been passing Bismarck for the past
ten days. The river at Bismarck
has been falling for the past week,
the change being from a maximum
of 12.6 feet to a minimum of 9.6 yes
terday, a total fall of 3.0 feet. This
fall, however, is not due to a lessen­
ing of the flow of floodwaters from
above, but from a series of gorges in
the Missouri river and its tributaries.
The gorge at the mouth of the Yeel
lowstone a short distance below Mon
dak, Mont., has caused that river to
back up rapidly, the rise at Glendive
during the past 24 hours being 8.0
feet. The Powder and Big Horn riv­
ers are high, as are the iMilk and
Knife rivers. A gorge between San
ish and Wttlliston has caused a con­
tinued rise at the latter point for
several days. Owing to the extreme
thickness of the ice between Wtlffe
ton and Bismarck, there is great dan­
ger of an overflow, when the ice
breaks. High temperatures prevail
over Montana and North Dakota, and
people on the lowlands are warned to
again be on their guard. This of
ce is keeping in constant touch with
conditions and prompt warnings will
be dent to residents of the lowlands
as soon as there is danger of the
river leaving its banks.

ADMINISTRATION DOES
NOT QUESTION RIGHT
Urged Plan As Humanitarian Ex­
pedient in View of Submar­
ine Activity.
Washington, March 10.—The En­
tente allies have agreed to inform the
United States that they cannot ac­
cept Ihe proposal in Secretary Lan­
sing's circular memorandum that a
modus vinvendi be entered into for
the disarmament of belligerent own­
ed ships. Conferences between the
Allies on this subject has ended and
formal replies to the American sug­
gestion are exyxc.ed in the near fu­
ture.
Plan Not Favored.
Advices to the state department
from the embassy at London, Paris
and Rome some tiiiie ago, made it ap­
parent that the disarmament plan
had met with no favor and the de­
partment ha: been proceeding on the
assumption that it would he rejected.
Purely Humanitarian.
The United States does not' ques­
tion the right under international law
of merchantmen to arm for defense.
Disarmament by agreement was pro­
posed purely as a humanitarian ex­
pedient, on acboiint. of the "deyr-lop
ment. of submarine warfare.
German Note Inconsistent.
Without such an agreement, the
law stands as it always has, and it
was in recognition of this principle
that the United States informed Ger­
many that, her announced intention
of sinking armed merchant ships
without warning was inconsistent
with assurances 'previously ..giveh, iu

Dr. Smyth paid a hight tribute
to the Bismarck Tribune for its
co-operation in the work of the
health department. He said "No
paper in the State of North Da­
kota has devoted more space to
the many health articles and to
the Baby movement and general
uplift work than has the capital
city daily, The Bismarck Trib­
une."
A large and enthusiastic meeting
held last evening in the Commercial
club hall closed the "Baby Week"
movement in the capital city. With­
ers, mothers, sisters mtl brothers as­

United States, lie further, slated
that of the total deaths from all caus­
es approximately 2~A per cent occur­
red in children under one year and
that 93.72 per cent of this number
might be classed as preventable.
Child Mortality Decreasing.
An interesting report was given by
Dr. Smyth, of which Bismarck might
be justly proud. Statistics for the
capital city for the year 1910 showed
the infant death rate to be 20 in
1911, 13 in 1912, 9 and in 1913, the
last to be compiled, 8. The decrease,
Dr. Smyth said, was through the
work of the health board in trying to
bring about sanitary conditions. The

Whether this long deferred action, which begins purely as a
punitive measure, to clnar Northern Mexico of menacing bandits'
bandits, over which General Carranza has no control, dhall go into
a general armed intervention or occupation in Mexico, depends in a
large measure upon General Carranza, and the Mexican people.
It begins with President Wilson's declaration that it is entirely
in aid of the Carranza government and with no thought of aggres­
sion.
CABINET APPROVES.
President, Wilson's decision to depart from thd policy of watch­
ful waiting, hastened bv the (olnmbus massacre yesterday, was an­
nounced today after being unanimously approved by the cabinet
and leaders in congreiss.
The president's position was explained fully to the latter, who
agreed that he should not be embarrassed at this time by discussion)
of a minority which might arouse trouble in Mexico.
VILLA MUST GO.
After a 'briqf cabinet meeting, at which the president was de­
scribed as being as determined to eliminate Villa as he was to elimi­
nate Huerta, Secretary Baker hurried to the war department and,
as his first act in office, sent orders to the border troops.
Soon afterwards, the army general staff assembled and con­
ferred over the plans, first drawn and perfected since the Mexican
situation loomed up as a disturber of the peiace oof the United States.
URGES UTMOST SECRECY.
General Funston telegraphed urging utmost secrecy of the army
plans. The border is honeycombed with Mexican spies and it was
agreed that the expedition would be put to success by keeping Villa
and his men ignorant of its movement. It is possible that no cor­
respondents will be! permitted to accompany the columns. At any
rale, a strict, censorship will be imposed.
GARRISON OFFERS HIS AID.
Former Secretary Garrison, familiar with the army Mexican
plans by his association with the crisis of two yeans ago, came to
Washington and otfered his services to aid his successor. Th4y
were at once accepted, and Mr. Garrison went into conference with
Secretary Baker at. the war department.
General Cari'anza, in a. telegram to the statei department, ex­
pressed regrets at the Columbus massacr®, but made no comment on
the proposal of sending American troops to hunt down the bandits.
{State department officials declined to say what their attitude
would be if General Carranza took a hostile position. They said the
United States would settle that question when it arose.. If an offer
of co-operation of Carranza troops is made, they said, it could hardly
ba refused.
ORDERS 5,000 TROOPS.
Today General Carranza ordered 5,000 troops from various gar­
risons to move upon the Villa force. The effect of their advance
probably would be to keep Villa forces near the border, bitt Secre­
tary Baker announced today that no matter how far into Mexico
it was necessary for Americans to penetrate, or to increase tftfo*
force, the United States would consider the expedition
a iranitiVt*
one, purely for the suppression of outlaws. For such an action flun
is ample precedence in international law.
How many of the 12,000 troops now on the border will be
ployed has not fully been determined.
