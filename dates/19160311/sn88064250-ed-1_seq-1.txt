SLOT MACHINE'S MUST
GO FROM ST. LANDRY
GRAND JURY URGES CITY AUTH ORITIES TO BANISH SLOT MA
CHINES AND GAMBLING
DENS FROM PARISH
The grand jury recently impanell
to ed for the ensuing six months re
ported its findng to the court on
h Thursday morning, after returning
it twenty-nine true bills and thirteen
le not true bills.
i The grand jury, of which O. L.
1e Gregory, prominent local lumber
man, is foreman, urged the munici
ld pal authorities to take steps to do
away with gambling, to order slot
,y machines and punch boards out of
this parish. It did not return aniy
true bills against any one, but it
warned those Who operate gambl
ing dens that they will be prosecut
r ed from now on.
It It has been known for sometime
10 that the grand jury would investi
e gate charges of gambling in this
h parish. The judge instructed the
f jury to investigate these charges.
11 This was done and it was thought
advisable, by the grand jury, to re
o commend to the municipal authori
e ties in the various towns in St. Lan
L. dry,to enact ordinances suppressing
r gambling of every form.
Following is the jury's report to
his honor B. H. Pavy, Judge:
' Your grand jury beg leave to sub
- mit its final report. We 'have care
s fuily investigated all cases sub
mitted to us for examination and
e have given due consideration to the
testimony of the witnesses produced
before us. We are firmly of the
g opinion that a final trial will justi
C fy such action as we have taken in
the cases presented.
Our attention has been specially
called to the fact that in certain
sections of our parish slot machines,
paying trade checks in return as
prizes, are being openly operated.
We are informed that these mach
ines in part are located in the places
where the children of the communi
ty are frequently assembled and
that it is a common occurrence for
children of tender age to risk and
lose the small change given them
by fond parents or instrusted to
them for the purchase of some ar
ticle for use of the household.
Such temptation should be remov
ed from our young ones. There are
even now too many pitfalls which
lie in the path of men of mature
years, calculated to bring about a
condition of sorrow and sadness, in
the home circle, to permit the open
and public operation of the gambl
ing devices designed to encourage
in our children the spirit of the
gambler.
We doubt not but that most of
those who have permitted the oper
ation of these machines, are "un
mindful" of the fact that they have
permitted themselves to be used as
tools, by others, who own and have
installed these machines, and week
ly reap the benefits of their illegal
earnings. For these reasons we have
seen fit to return no finding at this
session of our body. We have in
stucted the district attorney, how
ever, to take such action as is nec
cessary to have these machines
banished from our parish and to
prosecute by information all fut
ure violators of this character. We
earnestly call upon all of the exec
utive officers of the nnrish and pol
ice officers in municipalities, to co
operate with the other parish offic
ers in surpressing this vice. The
recent decision of the Supreme
Court, holding that punch boards,
paying a prize to the fortunate
puncher of a prize shall fall unfler
the prohibition of the statute,leaves
no room to question whether these,
machines fall under the ban of the
law.
We have taken due cognizance of
the subject matter.relative to which
your honor has seen fit to specially
charge us. We have had a number
of witnesses cited before us with a
view of making inqury into the
,matter.
That such violations of the law
nactually exist cannot be questioned.
GUIDRY-DAVID
Church Point, La., March 6th.
Ernest Guidry, son of T. Guidry]
aind Miss Daisy David, daughter of
R. David, were married here Sun-]
'day at t'he Catholic church. Rev.
A. F. Rogers officiating at the cere
mony. The many friends of both
wish them many long years of pros
perity and an abundance of happi
ness.
:o:
Mr. Yves Andreopont transacted
business in New Orleans and Amite
City during the week.
It is our purpose to have a thorough
investigation and full inquiry made
into this matter to the end that
therb may be no escape by those
who are guilty. When and by whom
these investigations shall be made,
it becomes unneoessary to state,but
we can assure your honor that we
will do all in our power to suppress
those dens that are sapping the man
hood of our young men and are can
cers on the body social.
In this connection we =call upon
the municipal authorities to enact
ordinances suppressing gambling
and to see that such ordinances are
strictly enforced.
Our attention has been called to
the dangerous condition of the
bridge accross Bayou Courtableau
in the village of Port Barre. We
understand that a dispute between
the parish authorities and munici
pal authorities as to which is charg
ed with the duty of maintaining
this lridge has arisen. We are not
charged with the duty of solving
this controversy. We recommend
that unless necessary steps be taken
to make this bridge safe to the
travelling public it be closed and
its use condemned.
We have examined the condition
of the public buildings. The sanit
ary condition of the jail can be
greatly improved. The cells occu
pied by the insane are in a very bad
sanitary condition and require im
mediate attention.
We would suggest that the win
dows of the jail should be entirely
screened to the end that persons on
the outside may be unable to pass
any object to those confined within.
Having completed our labors we
now beg to be discharged.
SPECIAL REPORT
Our attention has been called by
Hon. Henry Lastrapes, Jr., Clerk of
Court, to the condition of some of
the conveyance bodks in his office
and in 'his custody. These records
are in a delapidated condition and
require immediate rebinding. We
would earnestly request that our
police jury give their immediate at
tention to the condition of these re
cords and take the necessary steps
to preserve the same.

COMMITTEE MEETS TO
ARRANGE NEXT FAIR
Parish Fair to Be Held Oct. 5, 6, 7
and 8 Will Be Greatest Ever
BABY AND CLUB CONTESTS
TO BE OF LIVELY INTEREST
List of Prizes Will Double That
of Last Year and Show Will Be
Finest in This State
The executive committee of the
St. Landry Fariners Fair. Associa
tion met in the police jury room on
Wednesday evening at 3 o'clock and
decided upon plans for holding the
next annual parish fair.
The parish fair will be held at
the old high school on October 5,
6, 7 and 8. A program, unique and
interesting mill be arranged for
each day, A=dthe fair is destined
to be the teatest individual fair
in Louisiana,
Dr .R. M. ittell, president of the
fair associa tn, had prepared the
list of prize,, which met with the
approbation of the executive com
mittee.
There will be more money used
for prizes at the fair in October
than at any fair ever held in this
parish. Besi es the same depart
ments at the fair last year there
will be the better babies and the
boys' pig club departments.
The promoters of the parish fair,
and especially Dr. Littell, its
valuable president, have been de
sirous of starting pig club work in
St. Landry. With the assistance of
Professor Sledge, of the Grand Prai
rie School, and Farm Demonstrator
Babin, the fair association has been
able to launch a campaign for the
organization of several boys and
girls clubs in this parish.
The better babies contest is ex
pected to prove interestingly
unique, as a contest of this kind
has never been attempted in old St.
Landry. The babies of each town
will be allowed to compete against
one another, while the babies of the
rural districts will be in a contest
of ther own, thereby forming sev
eral contests in the -rame depart
ment, as there are several towns
in this parish.
The catalog of the parish fair
association will be issued within
the next, few weeks, so that those
who are desirous of exhibiting at
the fair will be in a position to pre
pare for the big event plenty of
time in advance.
It is the determination of the
members of the fair association to
make the St. Landry parish fair
the greatest of its kind in Louisi
ana; in fact it is the hope of ihese
'enthusiastic citizens to put the fair
on a par with the Donaldsonville
and Baton Rouge fairs, where sev
eral parishes combine to hold
their annual fairs.

Recently Elected Democratic Exec

John M..Prescott, popular young
assistant cashier of the Washing

man of the parish democratic exe
cutive committee at the organiza
toir of that body on last Saturday
afternqon. L. A. AndreponL of this
city, wis chosen secretary.
The deihocratic executive com
mittee, while it* is a body which
holds no monetary inducements to
the citizens of this parish, is one of
the most important bodies in the
democratic party, as it governs that
party; the parish committee is the
governing body of the democratici
party in this parish.
Mr. ,Prescott is probably the.
youngest democrat ever appointed
to this honorary position in this',
parish; he has always taken an ac-i
tiv~e interest in the piarty's welfare
in old St. Landry, as did his ances
tors.
The executive committee promul
gated the results of the recent pri
mary election, declaring A. L. An
drus as the party nbminee for as
sessor by 429 majority and R. Lee
Mills as the party nominee for po
lice juror from the first ward by a
majority of 80 votes.
The old committee was instructed
to dispose of the funds on hand and
to refund the various candidates
their pro rata. The new committee

STANID BY DEMOCRACY'
IS LAZARO'S ADVICE
SEVENTH DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE APPEALS TO FRIENDS TO
STAY WITH PLEASANT AND THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY
Dr. Ladislas Lazaro, representa
tive of the Seventh Louisiana Dis
trict, wll come to this state as soon
as possible, to help his fellow Dem
ocrats tide over the Parker senti
ment, according- to a letter re
ceived by Judge Gilbert L. Dupre
of this city from Dr. Lazaro him
self.
Dr. Lazaro points out that the
April election in this state is of
national importance arguing that in
the event Mr. Parker should be
elected governor of this state, the
Democratic administration would
receive a serious blow in that,
Roosevelt would have stronger ties
to the Republican nomination for
president. He says that Roosevelt
would boast of having broken up
the "Solid South."
Dr. Lazaro has been requested by
his friends in this district to come
to Louisiana in order to help Pleas
ant in the present campaign. He,
however, claims that he is too busy
td be able to leave Washington
for the present but that he will be
in the seventh district during the
early part of next month.
"Your letter of the 28th was re
ceived and highly appreciated,"
writes Dr., Lazaro to Judge Gil
bert L. Dupre. "I agree with you
t:iat we will have to work to get the
voters out at the general election.
I saw a good many when I went
home to vote and impressed them
with that fact.
'Of course you understand that
it is impossible for me to leave
Washington at this time because of
the international situation; the sug
ar . esolution, which has been made
a party measure and which will
come up in a - few days; and the
co ideration of the .Administration
Shipping Bill by the Committee on
Merchant Marine, of which I ami
a member. However, I will be in
Louisiana as soon as possible to
help you. I am writing to friends
all over the district every day ask
asking them to help the Party.
"I notice in the papers that a
good many of our friends have gone
over to Parker. I believe that theyi
W•ill realize in the course ofe time
that they are making a mistake.
"The Democratic Party in Louisi
ana has done more for our people
than any other party. Not only that,
but we should stop and think that
we are on the eve of a Presidential
election and the eyes of the country
are upon Louisiana today and the
election of our .Democratic ticket
will mean an indorsement of our
national Democratic administration
under the wise leadership of our
President, who has kept us out of
war so far. On the other hand, the
defeat of it would be an encourage
ment to Roosevelt, who is doing
all that lies in his power at this
very time to capture the nomina
tion of the Republican Party at
Chicago. In other words, if Louisi
ana goes Progressive, Roosevelt
will be in a position to say,'You
see, I broke the solid- South.'
"Of course, those of' our friends
who have gone over are looked up
on at home as 'Indepepdent Demo
crats,' but from a national stand
point the fight is between Parker,
PARKERITES HOLD THREE
MEETINGS LAST SUNDAY
Supporters of Independent Candi
date Start Vigorous Cam
paign in this Parish
The Parker supporters held three
large meetings in this parish on
last Sunday and it is understood
that all three were attended by
large and enthusiastic audiences.
At Grand Coteau, the first pre
cinct in this parish to openly avow
Parker sentiments, Hon. E. B. Du
buisson, Independent Democratic
candidate for attorney general, ad
dressed the gathering, while at
Leonville and Arnaudville several
prominent Parkerites spoke in be
half of the three candidates run
ping against the regular Democratic
nomnees.
The Parkerites in this parish in
tend to hold meetings at every pre
cinct, by which means they expect
to acquaint every voter in St. Lan
dry with the views and platforms of
their canddates.
Mr. and Mrs. George Vidrine are
in New Orleans, where Mr. Vidrine
ib receiving medical attention.
I the Progressive and follower of
Roosevelt, and Pleasant, the Demo
crat and follower of Wilson, and I
think we should do all that we can
to uphold the hands of our national
adminstration. We should do so for
many reasons, and some of them
are:
"That we have given the country
a sound banking and currency law,
which will prevent such panics as
there was under Roosevelt in 1907;
t'We have extended the parcel
post and rural service law;
"We have passed a seamen's law
to protect the lives of those who
travel the sea;
"We have passed the Panama
Toll bill,compelling private owned
vessels to pay toll who pass in the
Canal, and in that way helping to
make the Canal self-supporting in
stead of taxing the people for its
maintenance;
"A Trade Commission has been
created to arbitrate disputes in
commerce and do justice between
the public and the great industrial
corporations;
"The Clayton Anti-Trust Law has
been passed, which strikes at a mul
titude of absuses in financial affairs
"We have passed the Smith-Lever
Agricultural Law, which affords the
Government better facilities for
settling great railway and industrial
strikes. You will reniember that it
was this law which afforded the
means by which the President suc
ceeded in settling the threatened
strike of 1913 on the Eastren Rail
roads and the Westren Railroads
strike of 1914;
"We passed the Lever Cotton Law,
which means the scientific grading
of grain and cotton and the saving
of millions of 4cllars to th1arner
of the country;
"We are enacting a good roads
bill under which Louisiana is to
receive about $347,000;
"We are preparing a shipping bill
which will build up our merchant
marine and enable us to carry our
products to the markets of the
world without depending oh. foreign
ships.
A child labor bill has passed the
House and is now in the Senate for
consideration.
The bill giving the Philippine
Islands independence and self-gov
ernment is being enacted into law.
The Department of Agrioultuwe
is organizing an office of markets,
which will supply scientific andl
modern business methods and elim
inate the waste of transporting and
distributing farm products;
A more adequate and efficient
army and navy is being provided
for to protect our people and their
interests in case of emergency.;
We propose to pass a rural credit
bill which will enable t'he farmer
to borrow money on longer teisris
and at cheaper rates of interest:
thus to build up our boys and i
girls on the farms.
Hoping that our friends who
have gone over to Parker and who
now call themselves "Independent
Democrats" will consider this mat
ter from a national standpoint as
well as local, I remain,
Your friend,
L. LAZARO.
