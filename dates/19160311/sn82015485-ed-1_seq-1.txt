A Penny Saved is a
Penny Earned
This is an old saying that has been proved time
and again and is as good as ever.
It is emphasized by the present war which has
brought the big businesses of the United States to
realize they must pay the European investors who
have made it possible to do their big businesses.
Now it is up to the, Americans to furnish their
own business capital.
Here is where the small investors gets his big
chance, but he must have some money ready to
make his purchases.
Those having a saving account are the ones who -can
have this opportunity. . V

If you were "brought up'ronMc
Guffey's, Readers you may remember
the little poem (?) which began like
this: "Oh were you never a school
boy. and did you never train and feel
that swelling of the heart you never
can feel again? "With all the war
talk news we hear every day, one
might expect to see bands of march
ing boys with nags , flying: and drum
beating in all directions up and down
the street but nothing of the kind
appears. Is the American juvenile
becoming less martial in spirit than
his forbears were? Or is it because
the world citizen regards wholesale
murder with less and less favor.
o
Can you imagine the feeiirur of the
commander of a torpedo boat after
he has seen a thousand innocent men,
women' and children drowned like
rats as a result of the order he lias
given? Can he have any real pride In
bis achievement? Does the killing
of these people, whose only offense is
an attempt, to attend to their own
lawful business, afford him. any real
satisfaction? How. does he square
himsfcifc-with his conscience? Perhaps
he shirts the responsibility upon his
superior officer, . and from him it is
passed on up to the king or kaiser.
In his turn, the sovereign, far removed
from the sights and sounds of the
murder, may be persuaded that the
crime was necessary for the defense
of his country and an act of patriotism.
In - reality it is the spirit of war
(murder) that justifies these crimes.
Why should we foster such, a spirit?

HiraclM in Wheat
Seven, years ago a Russian farmer
invented a method of increasing the
yield of wheat In so startling a fash
ion that, when an article on the sub
ject appeared in an English paper,
people simply laughed and said It was
a fairy tale.
This Russian claimed that it was
possible to get 70 pounds weight of
grain from one seed, and to make an
acre carry 45 tons." " " -
This does sound like a miracle, . but
here Is the method, and If anv farmer
has the patience to try it he will most
certainly be surprised at the result.
Each grain Is planted separately in
a hole about firteen Inches deep, and
three, and. a half feet in width. Feet,
rememberno.t inches. ... r '
A8oon as the grain sprouts the lit
tle blade is covered with a thin layer
of earth about an inch and a half in
depth. The result is that Ton rt:
three stalks instead of one. At- the
end of three weeks the hoe comes into
use again, and the three stalks bain?
covered with earth, turn into nine
stalks. -
This process being repeated a third
time, results in 27 stalks, and the'
Russian in questions repeated it ten.
times in all. so that at last erf"
grain produced 59.040 stalks. If the
seed is first sown in the ordinary
iasmon and then transplanted to the
pit before mentioned, you set an even."
stronger growth, so that after only'
eignt coverings, more than 105.000
stalks has been produced from a sin.
