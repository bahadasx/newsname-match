Sun War Picture
Show Both Sides
When the first moving pictures
of the great war came to the United
States they were sent through
the connivance, or perhaps it would
be better to say, assistance of eith
er the Central "Empires or the En
tente Allies. They were sent with
the idea of creating heiVtiraent in
favor of one or the other of the
parties to the great struggle. Nat
urally they were highly partisan.
They showed but one side of it.
The New York Sun war pictures
which will be shown at the Graiul
opera house here next Wednesday
afternoon and evening under an ar
rangement which the West Virgin
ian has made with the New York
Sun. show both sides and $reat
pains have been taken to avoid
anything that would give riee to
partisan feeling in the audicnces.
They are bona lido war pictures;
they show warfare as it exists un
der modern conditions but they
6how both sides and give neither
side an advantage. For that reas
on. among others, they are regard
ed as the most interesting anil in
structive war pictures being shown
in this country.

isfy General Carranza and permit him
to comply with popular sentiment in

ceived but it is known that the ad
of avoiding a breech willi Carranza if
minisfrolinn realizes the necessity
the Mexican situation Is not to grow
into the status of armed Intervention.
"Up to noon today no American
troops actualy had crossed so far as
was known liere and It was believed
none would start moving before night.
All arrangements aro being left In

ISLE1 MEET
Easily Walked Away From
the Martinsburg Five
Today.
THE OTHEiT RESULTS
(Special to The West Vlrtfnian.)
BUCKHAJNNON, March 11.?Mart
insburg High school basketball team
was easy for Fairmont's fast flying
bunch In the game played here today
and went down to defeat by the score
of 38 to 13. Wilson for the Fairmont
II team was everywhere on the floor at
once and each of the' players showed
stellar material atr all stages of the
./ame. -Ttio-Martlnahuris team was tout
ed as .the dark horse In the campaign,
but failed to materialize when they
met the Fairmont five.
During the day Piedmont lost to
Parkersburg by the ecoiji ot 44 to 14.'
/arkersburg took the game easily and
will likely tackle Charleston for the
state championship. Buckhannon also
won. defeating Clarksburg by the
score ot 3S to 10.
Elkina and. New Martinsville played
a tight game -which was neither side's
until the llnal whistle blew. The game
ended 35. to 32 for Elklns. Thomas
won from Clay by the score ot 36 to 19.
One remarkable feature of all the
games played is that so far there have
been no Injuries.
Martinsburg was picked by all the
"experts" as the one team which
would eliminate Fairmont. The Fair
mont boys, who have been making
themselves at home here,.never lost
heart, however, and were on their toes
the minute the game started and they
finished strong. Wilson starred indi
vidually. niglit and Meredith backed
?tp Wilson In such shape that Fair
mont could not have lost. i.Wilson
caged almost every tlmo he threw. '
