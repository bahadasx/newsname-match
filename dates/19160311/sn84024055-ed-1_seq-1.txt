rayor William Hale Thompson and
the city fathers, to the great delight
of the people residing in this city, have
finally stopped their fighting and
wrangling, and seemingly they have
settled down to business which is a
mighty good thing. For the first part
of this week, without wasting half as
much time as is generally expended in
that direction, the aldermen who have
in the past been branded as the "rebels
and the whiskey bosses" by Mayor
Thompson, both Democrats and Re
publicans, freely voted in favor of the
passage of his the Mayor's 1916
budget, which amounts all told to more
than sixty-three million dollars.
The budget will have to be cut down
more than a million dollars -us the in
come from the city in every direction
is not and will not be near enough to
pay its running expenses and to keep
it half out of debt. This condition of
affairs has largely been brought about
the past year by adding too many
names to the payrolls and paying out
largo sums of money to the political
workers for Mayor Thompson for doing
nothing, like unto the Rev. Hon.
Archibald James Carey, Ph. D.D.D.
Rut come to think of it, the people
one year ago horsed and horsed for the
Hon. "William Hale Thompson for
Mayor, and now they have him and his
special political pet, the Rev. Hon.
Archibald James Carey, Ph. DJ)J).
This coming week the great fight
will begin in dead earnest between
Attorney Augustus L. Williams, State
Senator George P. Harding and Con
pressman Martin B. Madden for del
egate to the Republican National Con
vention from the First Congressional
District of Illinois. There are two
delegates to be elected, and Senator
Harding is not backward in proclaim
ing it aloud from the houso tops that
ho does not propose to get left, nor to
eome out at the tail end of the fight
ingthat he must and will it he lives
enjoy the great honor of sitting in the
forthcoming National Republican Con
vention as one of its delegates
Congressman Martin B. Madden and
his friends positively assert that he
'"'ill be one of the winners and come
out ahead in the Cbntest for-delegate.
So it will be up to Mr. Williams him
self to put either one of them out of
the running if he really feels that he
will and must butt or break into the
next National Republican Convention
as one of its delegates. He is the only
Colored man seeking that honor in any
of the Northern states, and if he should
win out it would be a big feather in
his political cap. Mr. Williams and
his friends claim that if the majority
of the Colored voters residing in that
district would stand by him that it
would be no trouble for him to make
a home run Tuesday, April 11.
Mr. George 'S. Jackson, who is rated
among the wealthiest Colored men in
this city, will enter into a hand to
hand fight or contest with the Hon.
Martin B. Madden for committeeman
of the Second Ward, and the same
forces that fought for some unnamed
doctor for the nomination for alder
man will be either behind or in front
of Mr. Jackson, who will start to fight
ing with his fire works Wednesday,
March 15.
Attorney William G. Anderson bet
ter known as Habeas-corpus Anderson,
has become an independent Republican
candidate for alderman of the Second
Ward. He had more than twelve hun
dred names of regular voters in that
ward signed to his petition. He figures
it out that that with the saloon and
cafe owners in the Second Ward on his
side, that he will receive more votes
on election day, Tuesday, April 4, than
either Alderman Hugh Norris and
Harry Hildreth, Jr., and that he will
be the next alderman from that ward.
On Wednesday evening, March 29, he
will give a grand blow-out and rally
at the Eighth Regiment Armory,
Thirty-fifth and Forest avenue, and he
says that "he will make the fur fly in
every direction" from now on until
the aldermanic election.
Prof. A. J. Bowling, not long ago
passed the Civil Service examination
for probation officer of the Juvenile
Court, but as he is a member of the
Moving Picture Censorshipv Board, he
waived his right or claim to that posi
tion, in favor of Mr. Hammond, who
has been connected with the south side
branch of the Y. M. C. A.

OAK PARK NEGRO, HOME SET
AFIRE, SEES WHITE MAN
Shoots as Arson Suspect Stumbles Over
Hedge Screaming.
SECOND ATTEMPT AT BLAZE.
The members of the family of Fred
R. Jefferson are the only Negroes
living south of Madison street in Oak
Park.
Ten gallons of gasoline were used
early on Wednesday morning in an at
tempt to set fire to Jefferson's home at
622 South Cuyler avenue. Mr. Jeffer-
.son asserts he saw a white man run
awayfrom Ithehouse and stumbleve
ahedge'iafter the blaze had started.
ThVOak'Park police are looking for
this man. He fired a revolver at hinT
five times. He was yelling when he
disappeared, and it is believed he was
wounded. Neighbors say an auto
mobile left the 'vicinity by way of
Jackson boulevard shortly afterward.
This blaze was the second attempt
made to burn his home. The first oc
curred in April, 1914.
Four clubwomen of Oak Park were
suspected at the time, and questioned
by Chief Deputy Fire Marshal Bach.
Has His Suspicions.
"I am not making any accusation,"
said Mr. Jefferson, "because I have no
evidence. But naturally I have my
suspicions. ' '
The latest blaze occurred about 1:30
o'clock. The Jeffersons would prob
ably have burned in their beds had not
the flare of the burning gasoline awak
ened hem.
Mrs. Jefferson carried out their lit
tle daughter, Faith, who is the only
Negro girl attending the Longfellow
school in Oak Park. Mr. Jefferson him
self could not get a connection over
either of the two telephones which he
has in his house and ran to a neighbor's
house to call the fire department.
It was after this that he fired at the
escaping white man. Mr. Jefferson has
learned the lessons of preparedness
and keeps- a rifle, a shotgun and a re
volver in the house, not to mention a
huge dog which is on watch in the
basement.
The fire practically destroyed the
front porch of the building and
scorched the sides and back. The
gasoline had apparently been placed in
jars.
Mr. Jefferson is a chauffeur for H.
R. Hamilton, president of the Nubian
Paint and Varnish company, who lives
at 222 Forest avenue, Oak Park.
Bought and Paid for Home.
Six years ago Mr. Jefferson pur
chased the house at the Cuyler street
address for $3,500. He paid for it on
the installment plan and now owns it
free from debt. His immediate neigh
bors are all white. He has been a stu
dent at the Art institute, where he
took a prize, and he was a member of
the Chicago Guards band, a Hull house
organization.
It is horrible to think that any 'in
telligent civilized human being would
attempt to commit such a dastardly
and revolting crime as the above upon
people who are law abiding, striving to
get ahead, in the world, and who are
not in the slightest degree infringing
upon the rights of others.
.It simply proves that when any peo
ple permit themselves to-be swayed by
Well Onto
race prejudice, it makes not the slight
ets difference how highly educated they
are, they are easily capable of trans
forming themselves into the lowest
savages, and are ready for the com
mission of all kinds of the most un
speakable and detestable crimes.

THE ILLINOIS BANNER, OF DAN

in the lower house of Congress
eighteen years in all, and his brilliant
record in Congress reads like an open
book who prior to that time was the
speaker of" .the. New York State As
sembly, who is s strong Prohibitionist,
would make, an ideal candidate for
president of-the-United States on that
ticket, as he .would successfully unite

sition, and millions of true American
citizens would vote for him for pres
ident of the United tSates, for they
have unbounded faith in his honesty
and sincerity.
Mr. Sulzer, in a letter to the editor
of the 'Banner, sets forts his views in
that connection as follows:
"New York City,
Feb. 26, 1916.
Editor, Banner: What the friends
of the prohibition cause are writing
me is most gratifying. If our friends,
sincerely believe I am best equippe'd
to carry the standard in the coming
campaign, I shall carry it where any
man will follow, and whether I win,
or lose, the Cause will gain, and after
the battle the- banner returned, unsul
lied to the-party.
Suffice it to say that I have no
vanity in the matter. I want to win
the fight for Prohibition that is all.
I am not dogmatically opposed to any
plan of campaign, or to any solution
of the problem. I am with the party
and I stand squarely on the National
prohibition Platform. My only ambi
tion is to be an instrumentality in the
great campaign, this year, to abelish
the manufacture, and the sale, of in
toxicating liquors. In the fight for the
Cause I am willing to lead for any plan
that will mean success. My plan to
tax the iniquity out of existence, is
simple, and straightforward, and con
stitutional. It will accomplish the pur
pose, and do it in the quickest time
and simplest way. Many of our friends
agree with me,, and favor the Sulzer
plan. However, I want to go along
tho lines of least resistance to accom
plish what we all have so much at
heart the abolition of the liquor
traffic.
To that end, it goes without saying,
I am as deeply interested, as you are,
in the coming campaign. But I am
more interested in unity, and in har
mony, than I am in candidates. If wo
can unite the reform forces in America,
behind the prohibition movement we
will win this year or certainly in 1920
and for one I want victory to crown
our efforts before I die and then have
it said I did my part.
WILLIAM SULZEB."
Mrs. J. S. Tandy will in the near
future give up her home at 5145 Fed
eral street and make her permanent
hosse with -her sister, Mrs. George 0.
