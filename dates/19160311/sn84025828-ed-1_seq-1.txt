the Control of the Managing Committees.
Kdwurd .1. Urundago is having his
first big light to maintain himself, as
llcpubllcan committeeman of tlio
Twenty-third Ward. Urundago was
formerly committeeman for the Twenty-fourth
Ward, but when the wards
were redlstrictod Ills rcsldenco wan In
cluded within the boundaries of tho
now and present Twenty-third Ward.
Urundago became committeeman au
tomatically for tho Twenty-third
Ward, and his brother, L. A. Urund
ago, was made committeeman for the
Twenty-fourth Ward.
Now tho Twenty-third Ward is n
pretty big proposition and has a largo
number of nblo llcpubllcan leaders In
it who did not vlow tho Urundago
leadership with pleasure to say thu
least.
Among these was tho powerful
Doneon-Uusso following, Including the
friends of Charles W. Andrews, former
committeeman, and Franklin Catlin,
former Representative.
This faction Includes tho most nc
tlvo Republicans In tho south and
east ends of tho ward. They havo
taken up Franklin Catlin as their can
didate for ward committeeman against
Urundago. As tho men composing
this crowd aro strong financially as
well ns politically their light Is n
Herlous menace to Urundago's con
tinued leadership.
Former Alderman .lacob A. Hey Is n
strong candidate also with a big fol
lowing. Mayor Thompson's friends are light
ing nrundugo with still another can
didate in tho person of A. O. Brick
son. Tho Catlin people aro making a
hard light and a house to Iioiieo cam

BLAME THE
REFORMERS"
The Fad Leaders and Sob Sisters
Constantly Suggesting New
Methods of Robbing
Taxpayers.
The law ought to bo amonded so
that professional reformers could bo
jailed without trial every tlmo they
discovered a new fad.
Professional reformers aro behind
the robbery of tho taxpayers of Chi
cago. Taxes wero never so high as they
aro now and aro still going up.
Reformers are still flocking to Chi-
cago to pluck tho Industrious pcoplo
and to fill high salaried but unneces
sary Jobs created for them.
Public Welfare 1
Public morals! I
Civil service!!!
What extortion and robbery of tax
payers is committed In those names.
Jobs for women reformers.
Jobs for malo reformers.
Jobs for professional reformers.
And tho Chicago taxpayer pays tho
freight.
Tho City Council Is full of useless
men, It is a useless body. It docs no
good and Is responsible for the creat
ing of costly Jobs to gratify fads.
It Is time the people woke up and
called a bait on this saturnalia of ex
travagance. Ten million dollars a year could bo
saved to tho city by tho abolition of
useless jobs.

There Is Too Much Psychopathic

The reformers who aro nullifying

weak, and should not bo punished for

Is normal."
Dr. Hcaly hnd recommended that
the boy bo sent to tho army or navy
or else to u farm.
"I havo too much respect for tho
uniforms of tho army and navy to put
n confessed criminal into one," said
tho Judge. "I think the farm is tho
place for him, ami tho stato has a flno
farm at tho Ponltac reformatory.
