WASHINGTON. Mar. 11. Former
Senator Henry Gassoway Davis of
West Virginia, who died last evening
of la grippe, will be buried at Elkins,
West Virginia.
Senator Henry Cassuway Davis wit
nessed and participated in the great
political epochs of American progress
for more than three-quarters of a cen
tury. He was the "old fashioned gen
lleman" In the senate. His utterances
were those of the old JefferBonlan
days.
Liberty and free government have
always been secured at the cost of
great sacrifices," he said on one oc
casion. "But liberty teaches us that
both can be easily lost without the
knowledge of the people."
It is significant that he was born
in the same year, 1823, at Woodstock,
Md., that the Monroe Doctrine became
a fundamental priclple In American
politics. During his distinguished car
eer he fought to maintain it. He later
represented the United States at two
Pan American conference at which
by his personality and speeches he
strove to strengthen the bonds of
friendship between North, and South
America.
Senator Davis' active political car
eer began the year after the Civil War.
He was elected a member of the house
of delegates of the new state of West
Virginia, and next served as state
senator.
West Virginia sent him to the Uni
ted States senate as Its first Democra
tic representative In 1871. He served
two terms with distinction. He cease
lessly urged congress to help the
farmers by establishing an agrlcultur
al department. His own bills failed
in passing, but he lived to see the day
when his far-sightedness was recog
nized. A familiar figure In presidential con
ventions, Senator Davis led his dele
gates from West Virginia to the nom
ination hall on seven occasions, pro
bably a record for such service.
A year after he had retired volun
tarily from the senate, he was urged
to become candidate for vice-president
on the ticket with Grover Cleveland.
He declined. He accepted the nomina
tion, however, as running mate with
Alton B. Parker and Uius became the
oldest candidate, aged 81, ever selec
ted for the office.
The venerable senator was not only
a Democrat in politics, but he was a
Democrat In nature. He was the
champion of liberty.
"Imperialism Is hurtful and abhor
rent in a free government," he declar
ed when accepting the nomination for
vice-president In the St. Louis con
vention of 1904. "The policy of Im
perialism is always dangerous to
liberty."
His great business career began
when he became brakeman on a
freight train. His raise was rapid. At
that time railroad trains did not run
at night it was too dangerous. At
Shortly after the arrival of train
24 from the north Monday morning the
private car Mizpah will be thrown
open for visitors. The silver service
will be then on dispiay and there will
be several people present to explain
the beautiful articles of plate. In or
der to avoid confusion the spectators
will enter at one end of the car and
pass out of the other. It was found
impracticable to pack the service and
move it to an uptown location for dis
play. The arrangements are being
handled by the railroad company and
by the people who are accompanying
the service. A locar committee was to
have been formed, but it received no
intimation that lta services would
be needed In co-operation.
