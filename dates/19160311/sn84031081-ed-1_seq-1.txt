Throwing large masses of infantry
against the French in the Corbeaux
to the northwest of Verdun, the Ger
mans after several attacks in which
they are declared by Paris to have
suffered large casualties, have re
taken part of the wood from which
the French had previously ejected
them.
The entire , region about Verdun
continues the scene of intense opera
tions. West of Douaumont and the
sector embracing the village of Vaux
have been points against which the
Germans have launched vicious in
fantry attacks, but at both places
their efforts to udvance broke down
under the heavy fire of the French,
according to Paris.
Goi-mans Claim Gains.
Tierlin, however, counters this as
sertion by announcing the taking of
a ridge west of Douaumont by- the
Hermans and says also that the Oer-j
mans ntjvp sneeeeaea in pusning iw
ward their line through the wooded
sector southeast of Damlonp, which
lies a short distance east of Fort Vaux.
The statement is made in the Gor
man official statement that the
French have succeeded in gaining a
firm footing in Fort Vaux. Paris had
previously categorically denied that
the Germans had captured either the
fort or the village of Vuux.
Heavy Bombardment.
F.ast and southeast of Verdun over
a front of about seven and a half
miles the1 Germans have been direct
ing a heavy bombardment on the
towns of Fix, Moulainvllln, Vlllers-sous-Bonchnmp

Washington, March 10. America's
pre-dreudnaught fleet would go over
like nine pins if pitted against Brit
ish or other craft of the same nge,
Capt. W. S. Sims, commander of the
new superdreadnaught Nevada, told
the house' naval committee today, be
cause "colossal mistakes" in con
struction have never been rectified.
Other countries, he said, had spent
millions in re-designing the older
ships to meet changed conditions.
Ship Badly Designed.
Illustrating his point, Captain
Sims, who as a lieutenant went over
the heads of his superiors to obtain
President Roosevelt's support in his
campaign to improve methods of tar
get practice in the navj said the old
bulldog of the navy, the battleship
Oregon, probably was the worst naval
design ever put afloat. Her unbal
anced turrets held the ship down on
broadside fire, he said, until her skin
below tho armor belt no thicker than
a man's hand, was exposed to gun
fire.
Food for F.neiny Guns.
The turrets of tho Kentucky and
the .Kenrsarge were so designed, he
declared, that four 12-inch shells
could enter the gun ports at one time;
the sloping roofs of the Connecticut
i class turrets were built to withstand
short range direct fire and were no
better than paper against modern
plunging fires; the turrets of the
Illinois class had a gap in the armor
at the back of the turret six to
eight feet wide, directly in line with
the ammunition hoists Inside.
Modern ("raft Well Built.
All these defects, Captain Sims at
tributed to the organization of the
department that prevailed for years.
He insisted that a general staff would
have rendered them impossible and
told tho committee that with the
general board determining military
characteristics of ships, modern Am
erican battle craft were well built.
Captain Sims declared submarines
could not defend a coa.st and that the
defense of New York should be made
1,000 miles at sea. He had positive
knowledge, he said, that the British
fleet spent part of its time behind
nets In sheltered harbors and the
rest at sea surrounded by screen
fleets and submarine nets when not
in rapid motion. The only German
submarine " that got through the
screens, he said, had been rammed
by a battleship and sunk.
The officer said it wns nor subma
rines which defended Heligoland, the
great German .huso on. the North sea,
but shore batteries, mines and surface
torpedo craft.
"I do not hesitate to say," he added
"that the 100 submarines of the shore
service type concentrated around New
York, a hostile fleet could sail in
near enough to shell New York, pro
vided It controlled the surface. It is
necessarv to control the surface. If
a fleet doe that it can keep the sub
marines out with nets."

(V MOHNINS JOUHt IMCIHL L1AMO l
Washington, March 10. Indica
tions late tonight were that the car
rying out. of President Wilson's order
that American troops re-enter Mexico
to capture or kill Villa and his ban
dits would be left to the man on the
ground, (leneral Frederick Funston.
After a late conference with the pres
ident, Secretary Baker announced
that no Invasion of Mexico in force
whs contemplated; that the troops
would be sent to disperse or capture
the raiders and would be withdrawn
immediately when their work was
done or when the de facto government
was utile to insure peace along the
border.
Plans Kept Secret.
Officers of the general staff began
al once the preparation of instruc
tions to General Funston in accord
ance with this announcement. Their
purpose was not revealed. Earlier
in the day General Funston had sug
gested that the plans for troop move
ments across the border be kept se
cret. He desired to add the element
of surprise to his weapons for aveng
ing the murder of Americans at Co
lumbus, (leneral Funston also urged that
cavalry be sent to replace the mount
ed force he might withdraw from bor
der patrol duty to form the expedi
tionary clumn or columns. Steps to
comply with this wero taken ut the
war department.
Whatever new troops are needed
will be .ordered promptly to the bor
der. Officials of tho department and
Secretary Baker himself worked far
into the' night on details of possible
troop movements, supplies and tho
like.
Not to Hamper Fwtston.
The secretary's call at the White
House followed a busy day at the war
department. The machinery of the
general staff was set in motion im
mediately after President Wilson's de
cision to hunt down the raiders was
announced at the close of the cabinet
meeting. The war plans committee
nssembled and went over the situa
tion: Little detailed information as
to the immediate situation ou the
Mexican side of the border is avail
able here. Such matters are under
Hie-jurisdiction of General Funston,
who has his own Intelligence office.
The committee quickly reached the
conclusion, it is understood, that Fun
ston must, be left unhampered to work
out the problem of pursuing the ban
dit with whatever force he thinks
necessary and at the same time secure
American border towns and ranches
against repetitions of tho Columbus
raid.
Suggestion rt Prt's Net.
Tho committee also nssembled facts
and figures in relation to a possiblo
decision to sweep tho whole of north
ern Mexico with a military drugnet
to catch tho bandits. Such a plan, it
was said, while certain to end the dis
turbed conditions along the border,
would involve the "se of troops by
tho tens of thousands Insteud of reg
iments. Figures as to the force the
committee thought necessary for op
erations In this capture were not re
vealed. Immediately after they were
submitted to Secretary Baker, how
ever, the latter arranged his confer-
enco with President Wilson and laid
tho whole situation before the com
mander-in-chief.
Some appreciation of the problem
confronting General Funston may be
gathered from information in pos
session of war and stale department
officials as to conditions across the
border. General Funston telegraphed
a conservative estimate of Villa's
forces today at 3,000 men. Other re
ports indicate he has 5,000. Villa Is
understood, however, to be short of
arms and ammunition which may
prove an Important factor In the
struggle to come.
Wide Area of Operations,
Whether Villa will concentrate his
followers or continue to evade pur
suit in scattered bands can only be
guessed. Department officials realize,
however, that the field of operations
may include a territory approximate
ly 400 miles long and as many wide.
In any of these 100,000 square miles
Villa might operate with a certain
knowledge of every Wall and water
hole. Villa always has shown a pref
erence through his years of outlawry

Should Villa concentrate his men

not anticipate that he can be lured
into an open fight. The most promis

noint Is shortage of ammunition. It

No Bequest to Oarrimza.
It was learned tonight thnt the
state department did not ask Ambas
sador Arredondo to request permis
sion of his government for American
troops to enter Mexico or for the co-
operation of tho do facto troops be
cause he wished to avoid placing Car
ranza in an embarrassing position.
The deportment realized that if he
were forced to refuse, the dispatch of
tlie punitive expedition would be an
act of war, while for him to accede
might create friction for the first
chief with the radical element, al
ways anxious to resent foregln inter
ference regardlesss of the motive.
Ambassador Arredondo merely was
told by Secretary I.nnsing of the de
cision of the president and tonight he
sent this information to Carranza.

Douglas, Ariz., March 10. Three

were sent eastward along the border;
from Agua Prieta, Solium, today by
Gen. P. Elius Calles, military governor
of Sonoru. They were instructed to
hold San Luis pass, near the junction
of tho New Mexican, Sonora and Chi

These soldiers will co-operate with
the Seventh I'nited States cavalry pat-

Tho Carranza soldiers will wear red
