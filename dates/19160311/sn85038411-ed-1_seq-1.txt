Washington. March I!. —In-
structions conveying authority to
General I'uuston to dispatehe a
defensive expedition into Mexico
in pursuit of Villa and his bandits
are to-ilay in General Fnnston's
lu* nds.
Secretary lJaker specifically re
ferred to the expedition as "de
fensive" in line vvltll the adminis
tration's policy of regarding Ms
action as one to repel invasion.
By Associated Press
Washington, March 11. While
American troops are preparing to
move across the Mexican border to
exterminate the Villa bandits. Gen
eral Carranza. in an official com
munication delivered through Consul
Silliman. has asked the United States
for permission to send his troops into
American territory if necessary In
pursuit of outlaws.
W Administration officials regard Gen
eral Carranaa's proposal as favorable.
Tt seems to indicate that he will not
protest against American troops on
Mexican soil, as had been feared.
Practically such a reciprocal arrange
ment probably never would result in
a single Carranza soldier crossing the
lino, as the possibility of bandits tak
ing refuge in American territory is
considered remote.
Would Satisfy Carranza
It is realized that such an arrange
ment. however, would go far to satisfy
General Carranza and i>ermit him to
comply with popular sentiment in
Mexico. There was no indication early
to-day how the proposal would be re
ceived. but it is known thi.it the ad
ministration realizes the necessity of
avoiding a break with Carranza as
the Mexican situation is not to grow
into the status of armed Intervention.
Secretary Baker to-day referred to
Ihe American expedition as a "de
fensive" one. This was regarded as a
significant indication of the adminis
tration's policy to make it clear that
it is proceeding with scrupulous re
gard for the sovereignty of Mexico
and entirely in aid of the constituted
authorities.
Will Start To-night •
Up to noon to-day no American
troops actually had crossed so far as
was known here and it was believed
none would start moving before night.
All arrangements are being left in
the hands of Major General Funston.
A'illa was to-day reported moving
southeast and with not more than "00
men night's report gave his
force as 3.000 but that is believed to
include sympathizers in his territory.
By his movement southeast it was
thought a threatened attack on the
American Mormon colony at Casus
Grandes had passed for the present.
Mormons Want Aid
Senator Smoot, of Utah, received
telegrams to-day from Mormbn lead
ers urging him to impress upon the
War Department the danger to the
colony at Casus Grandes. The colon
ists want to reach American soil.

with the war department and was as

PRICES OF PAPER
GOING UP; MAY BE
A FAMINE SOON
Mills 4 Months Behind Orders
With Situation Growing
More Acute
Prices of paper are going by leaps
«nd bounds. There is no end of the
advance in sight. Paper firms are
warning their customers against a
possible famine and are re-calling all
quotations. The situation is becom
ing desperate with some printers who
are short on lines now oIT the market
and for which they have contracts
standing.
The Johnston Paper Company of
this city yesterday issued the follow
ing card to its patrons throughout
Central Pennsylvania:
To our Customers:—
Further advances have been
made in printers' papers render
ing our "Chanees in Prices" list of
February 26, 1910, of little value.
Changes are coming so rapidly as
to make it impossible to issue a
correct list of prices.
I'ntil we can see our way clear
to issue a new list, all orders will
be filled at prices in effect when
f orders are received.
JOHNSTON PAPER CO.,
South Market Square.
Harrisburg, Pa.
The Donaldson Paper Company on
March 1 sent a special circular to its
| customers on the paper situation, in
I part as follows:
"The unprecedented conditions pre
; vailing in the paper market to-day
make it impossible to issue a price list
that would be of service, owing to the
I daily advances in all kinds of mate
rial entering into the manufacture of
i paper.
"The mills are four months behind
on orders and the indications are that
this condition will become more
acute.
"It is not unlikely that in a short
time price will cease to be a factor
and the question will be one of obtain
ing raw materials In sufficient quanti
ties to meet the normal demand.
"The manufacturers have reserved
the right to bill paper at the market
price at the time of shipment.
"We will protect our regular cus
tomers In every way possible, as it is
our earnest desire to co-operate with
them.
"You- may rest assured that any
orders you send us will have our most
1 careful consideration in the way of
1 service and price."

Mrs. Wright retold her story of the i
nine-day trip with the bandits as)
though it were commonplace. She
had suffered so much that she had
apparently lost all sense of fear.
Because-she suffered in silence and
held herself aloof, she was called

At one year it should start to walk.
At two years a baby should be able
