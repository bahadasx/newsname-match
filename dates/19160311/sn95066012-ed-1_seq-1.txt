Suiiwavry in Attack North
hw.: , Verdun
SEVERAL VILLAGES BOMBARDED
Entire Region Around Verdun Con
tinues the Scene of Intense
Operation.
London, March 10. Throwing large
masses of Infantry against the French
in the Corbeaux wood, northwest of
Verdun, the Germans after several at
tacks, in which they suffered heavy
casualties, have retaken part of the
wood from which the French had prev
iously ejected them.
: The entire region about Verdun con
tinued the scene of Intense operations.
West of Douaumont and tbe section
embracing the 'village , of Vaux have
been' points against which the Ger
mans have launched vicious infantry
attacks but at both places their efforts
to advance were broken down under
the heavy Are of the French, accord
ing to Paris.
Berlin counters this assertion by an
nouncing the taking of a ridge west of
Douaumont by the Germans, and says
also that the Germans have succeeded
in pushing forward their line through
the wooded section southeast of Dam
loop, a short distance east of Fort
Vaux.
The statement Is made in the Ger
man official communication that the
French have succeeded in gaining a
firm footing In Fort Vaux. Paris ban
previously categorically denied that
the Germans had captured either the
fort or the village of Vaux.
East and southeast of Verdun over
a front of about seven and a half
miles the Germans have been direct
ing a heavy , bombardment on tbe
towns of Eix, , MoulalnvIIle, Vlllers-Sous-Boncliamp
and Bonzee, with the
French guns answering energetically.
f . In the Artpis region the French
have occupied the crater of a mine ex
ploded by the Germans and fn Lor
raine have damaged German organisa
tions on the front of Hailevulerera-
