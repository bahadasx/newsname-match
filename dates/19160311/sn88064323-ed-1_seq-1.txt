IBERIA'S NEXT CORONER
Dr. E. S. Fulton, the Choice of the Progressive Party,
Is Fast Gaining Ground.
At one of the recent waid
meeting« in thin paiish, a political
leadet of recognized ability mar
veled at the progress made by
Dr E 8 Fulton in bis campaign
for the office of Coroner. He
«aid: "That man has surpris'd
mo. I wa« a bit apprehensive
that onr people would not take
kindly to him and hi« red whis
kerR—that when he would arise
to addles« them they would melt
away until there would be none
left to applaud the speaker's ell
maxes But how different has
been bis experience f rr m my ex
peotations. l)oc seems to have
found the passe partout to the
hearts and affections of onr peo
pie, who are receiving him wi'h
open arms and enthusiasm every
where."
It Is a power that is not given
to all. to so present one's claims
foi consideration that lie may be
coidially enteitained by a people
so diffeient In customs, tastes,
and language Dr Fulton has
I
been ho candid, straightforward
aud frank with all, even from the
first, that he baa disarmed at
onoe any tendency to erect barri
ers against his entry into their
closest confidences. He has been
reoeivd, not as a stranger made
weloome, but as an old family
friend, entitled to and worthy of
every hospitality and courtesy at
their bands.
At the Progressive primary
election held in this parish on the
last Saturday in January Dr. Fui
ton, in a closely contested race,
was chosen as the party nominee
for the office of Ooroner of this
parish That he should have re
celved each a mark of preferment
over a son of the people,—over
one who is in every way eminent

them, —mast be Attributed to bis
great powers of personal raague

LAKE CHARLES WATER
SUPPLY SUSPECTED.
River Breaks Into Artesian
Product and Citizens Are
Given Warning.
Lake Charles, La , March 7 —
I Notice was received this after
noon from the State Board of
Health at New Orleans that local
residents should commence boil
ing their drinking water again.
This follows the breaking of a
small reservoir at the waterworks
plant, which has allowed river
water to come in contact with the
artesian water supplied for the
mains. A sanitary engineer from
the state board is expected here
tomorrow to take oharge.
The waterworks company failed
to submit a prioe on Its plant to
the city this morning, although a
resolution was adopted some time
ago by the commissioners asking
the company to make an offer on
or before March 7. The commis
•loners have aeleoted an expert
engineer who will represent Lake
Charles on a special committee to
appraise the vhlne of the plant.
The water franchise expires in

home. Then as a small boy In
went to Texas with his parents
and there remained until grown
to manhood, lit' went to Tennes
see where his education was at
tained and win re he received the
M I) degree from the University
of Tennessee. He returned to
this, his native state, to practice,
and after four years spent in the
lumber districts, be came to New
Iberia in Idll to east his lot and
made his home with us. He won
the heart and hand of a charming
dangbtei of Arkansas, who came
with him to grace his home and
share his fortune. « He has two
brothers now living in East Lou
isiana. .
While the present campaign is
but fairly staited it is very dear
to him who can read the "signs of
the times" or "the handwriting
on the wall," to determine who
will be Iberia's next Coroner.
Thi' population of Iberia parish,
according to the last census, was
given as being ill,2(52 Ar about
one-half of the population are
negroes, and of the remaining
half, only about one in live are
voters, this redaccs the possible
vote of this parish to something
like ff, 150. Of this latter number
there are Invariably many ab
sentees on election days; some are
without interest and will uot go
to the poles; others may be ill
and cannot venture oat; and still
others have become "squaw men."
80 , when we liud the voting
strength of this palish reduced to
twenty eight hundred in round
figures, It is about right and rea
sonable. By recent estimates,
the Progressives will marshal fnl
ly 1750 voters In this parish—
leaving possibly 1000 Democratic
votes in the parish. Therefore,
it is an easy guess that Dr. Ful
ton will be Iberia's next Coroner,
even not taken into calculât!« n
those Democrats who will vote
for him fioin peisunal sentiments.

Would it not be just as well
