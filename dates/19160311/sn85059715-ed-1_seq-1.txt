might require to maintain an ade-j
qua to patrol along the border, in addition
to the expeditionary force,
would be promptly furnished. He
added .that the war department had
been deluged with telegrams from Individuals
and organizations afTerlng
services as volunteers.
There was at present Secretary
Baker said, no need for summoning
volunteers to the colors, although the
department appreciated fully the patriotic
spirit behind the offer. ?
The department was not advised
this morning as to whether General
Funston would lead the expeditionary
force in person. Secretary -Baker
said he lmd no announcement to

of a Mass Meeting.
(Contributed.)
A. l>. Williams, state road engineer,
was Introduced to nn overwhelming
crowd In theFltzhUgli hall at llridgeport
yesterday nfternooti by the chairman.
George Camp, al the good roads
meeting of Simpson district. Mr.
.Williams dwolt upon Importance of
the construction of public roads. He
said In part:
, "We n? people have not given
road building the proper consideration
in the past, and nothing has been
done by the engineering profession
to solve the problem."
Me urged very strongly the importance
of building roads to take cure of
the moss of tra 111c which was In the
country, lie stated that the railroads
could not ImnQle the bulk of truffle
which was In the country nnd tliat
| good roads were ou ronly salvation.
I In speaking of the high cost of llv;
Ing Mr. Williams said that mud .hoiks
! were playing a big part In that cost
| He stated that It \yaa costing each
farm In West Virginia about $500 to
i keep the mud holos. One thousand
farms In thn state paying the above
amount each year should awake our
minds.
On an average tho 1,000 farms are
only producing 9450 each year, consequently
coming out In debt ISO on
i each farm to keep the rottdn going
and keeping up the mud holes.
Tho state of Wdst Virginia through
the university at Morgantown was tho
Drat state in the union to take up the
work of mnking a study in thetr university
of this Important question of
working out in their laboratories the
secret of construction of good roads.
At this time and within the next
year West Virginia will spend over
110,000,000 for building good roods.
In spending this mfmey Mr. Williams
said he wanted It understood be:wits
for building roads for the people and
to accommodate the most of the people
and keep up our turnpikes and national
highways. ^ N
F. B. Davlsson took the stand after
the report of the, standing committee
had been read and accepted.
Mr. Davlsson gave a talk on his
schooling experience In Charleston
and Washington and gave the people
to understand that he believed In seeing
America first.
In spite of the five minute limit
put on alt speeches for the afternoon,
Mr. Davlsston was seen as a bobbing
jumping jack popping up ant^ down
dashing fire Into the meeting.
Philander K. Stout took the fipor
and in his usual oratorical manner
he took the meeting In his hands and
filled tho clouds full or blue smoke.
John C. Johnson here appeared on
the scene, with a motion in which he
proposed to build the roads In Simpson
district' for tho people and not
for the sake of accommodating any
personal friends. Mr, Johnson said
our money must be spent for the
people and for the people ho was.
Give the people-.all a part of those
roads In proportion to their taxes. He
set forth In his motion that we build
the road from Bridgeport to Grasselll
thence to Clarksburg, thus making
tho 'connecting link with, the brick
road Into our county seat, Clarksburg,
to build a road on Brushy Fork and
the Phlllppl pike two miles, also to
build two. miles on Davisson run, two
rolies fr?jm Bridgeport to the FaMs

LyleB. Horno* took the floor, here
and! In a five' minute talk took the
house.: Mr. Hornor said that hie was
not in favor of letting the county

He "pointed out where the county"
court"hadAbeen for the last "century
building roads and had built no
roads. Mr. Hornor said:
"I believe we havo enough brains
In Simpson district to build broads
and to build substantial roads with
calling, on thejassistance of t li*. county^

He urged the citizens and
