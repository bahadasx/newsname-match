Prench vital statistics for the first
six months of 1914 have recently been
published. In that half year the deaths
exceeded the births by 17.000. During
eight of the last twenty-five years, in
fact. France has needed more coffins
than cradles. Had it not been for the
pressure of Italian and other foreign
element with a high birth rate, the
showing would have been even worse.
The French native stock has been
losing in numbers. This decline is
bound to be increased for a time at
least, by the present war. Besides
those slain in battle, we must count
upon a temporary diminution in the
normal number of births. A prolonga
tion of the war into 1916 might con
ceivably and France facing as never
before the problem of a great decline
in population.
Physicians are beginning to note an
In, rease in the number of night hor
ro-s among children and attribute
these dreams of terror to overindul
gence in moving picture shows. That
these terrors are increasingly magna
fi is due to abnormal and unstable
stimulation of the child's delicate ner
vous system by scenes of adventure
thrown upon the canvas. The New
York Medical Recordl says: "Physt- I
cians cannot afford to ignore the
numerous hygienic aspects of motion
pictures which have become an im
portant institution of modern life. The
relation of these pictures to mental
hygiene in the case of the growing 4
child is one that demands the atten
tion of the medical profession."
