tions are thjattWe carrying out of Presi
dent Wilson's order that American
troops re-enter Mexico to capture or
kill Villa and his bandits, will be
left to the man on the ground, Gen
eral Frederick Funston.
After a late conference with the
president yesterday, Secretary Baker
announced that no invasion of Mex
ico in force was contemplated, that
the troops would be sent to disburse
or capture the raiders and would be
withdrawn immediately when their
work was done or when the defacto
government was able to insure peace
along the border. Definite plans
were not made known.
Claims 3,000.
Some appreciation of the problem
Villa's confronting General Funston may be
gathered from information in the pos
session of war and state department
officials as to conditions across the
border General Funston telegraphed
a conservative estimate of Villa's
forces today at 3,000 men. Other re
ports indicate he has 5,000. Villa is
understood, however, to be short of
arms and ammunition, which may
prove an important factor in the
struggle to come
Whether Villa will concentrate his
followers or continue to evade pur
suit in scattered bands can only be
guessed Department officials real
ized, howeved, that the field of op
erations may include a territory ap
proximately 400 miles long and as
many wide.
Carranza Not Pleased.
Douglas, Ariz March 11.Ac-
cording to information from a reli
able source received here, General
Carranza replied to a telegram sent
to him by General Elias Calles,
military governor of Sonora, asking
the first chief of the de facto Mexi
can government for an expression of
opinion on the act of President Wil
son in ordering a punative expedition
into Mexico to capture Villa, as fol
lows:
I am very sorry that conditions
are such that the United States
deems it necessary to take the action
of whioh you have advised me."
1,200 on Way.
Columbus, N M, March 11.
Twelve hundred Carranza troops, fly
ing a black and white flag to distin
guish them so that the American sol
diers would not mistake them for
bandits and attack them, reached the
border today It is believed to be
their intention to assist the Ameri
can troops in the pursuit of Villa.
Must Be Ready.
San Francisco, March 11.All mo
bile troops in the western department
were ordered today to hold them
selves in readiness to proceed to the
Mexican border.
Major General Franklin Bell,
commanding the western department,
received the order from Washington.
Troops in Alaska, it was thought,

quality of the- land in the vicinity

settlers, would come to this land fast
