American Soldiers Will Enter Mex

and Douglas.
MAY HAVE TO INVADE SONORA
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March 10.
Unofficial information from high of
ficers at ort Sam Houston tonight
paid that General John J. rerohlnR,
commanding Fort Blisa, will he In
command of the punitive expedition
Into Mexico.
Major General Frederick Funston
(tald that as plana being worked on
py, himself and hla staff were not
completed, he would not announce
the scope of the plan of the army
movements.
Unofficially, however, It was said
that the expedition against Villa
would be on a considerably larger
cale than at first thought. Entrance
to Mexico, according to this report,
will be through three places.
Will F.ntraln at F.l Pao.
A regiment of Infantry, a regiment of
cavalry and probably a regiment of field
artillery will, It was stated, entrain at
El Paso for Casas GranJes, ovar the
Mexican Northwestern railroad. Casas
Orandes waa raided by Villa two weeks
ago, and Is the place from which he
marched on Coluiribus. From Casas
Grandcs tho American forces, assisted
probably by Mexican troops sent out from
Juarez and Chihuahua, will make their
way south and westward to rut off Villa
If he attempts, to retreat'to hla fastness
In the San Andrea country, sixty miles
west of Chihuahua ICty. At the same
time a regiment of cavalry and one of
light atllrlery . will penetrate Chihuahua
southward from Columbus, entering Mex
ico two miles north of Palomas. These
will pick up the trail of Villa and his men
and continue the pursuit.
Will Leave Eastward. . .
From Douglas, It was stated, also un
officially, that at least a regiment and
probably two regiments of cavalry will
leaVe eastward to head off Villa If he de
cides to come Into Sonora. At the same
time a battalllon of Infantry will be sent
to the end of the Nacosarl railroad line,
sixty miles south of Douglas, to prevent
Villa leaching and attacking tha place
and the El .Tlgre mine, twenty mile dis
tant. Orave fears were expressed that the In
vasion of not only a part of Chihuahua,
but th whole of Sonora, would become
necessary, since thousands Villa's sympa
thizers are known to be still In that state
ostensibly undo)- the banner of Carranza.
These are thought likely to break out In
revolution' against the American forces
M any moment, it was stated.
In that case the strategic, points of
entry would be Naco, Douglas, Nogales
and Cumpas. Ariz.
Aero Hqaadroa t Oa. -
Unofficially It waa stated that probably
the entire first aero squad. United States
army, stationed here, would be dispatched
in one or" two Mays, perhaps tomorrow,
for El Paso, there to co-operate with the
other troops.
'A battalion, of the Twentieth Infantry
has been moved to Victoria, Tex., from EI
Paso.
' A battalion of the Eleventh Infantry
haa been moved from Douglas, Ariz., to
Huchtta, X. M., 100 miles east.
Villa Asked. Zapata
to Join in Invasion
COLUMBUS. N. M.. March 10,-An In
vitation to General Emlliano Zapata to
march north and Join In an attack on
the-United States was sent by Francisco
Villa in January, according to a copy of
a' letter found among Villa's captured
papers. The letter was dated San Gero
nlmo, Chihuahua, January I. 1916.
'1 shall not expend another shell on
brother itlexlcana," Villa wrote In the
letter, "but' will prepare and organize to
attack the Americans on their own soil
and let them know that Mexico is a land
of the free and the tomb of thornless
crowns and traitors."
Villa proposed that the Joint movement
with Zapata against the United States
eaould occur six months from January 4.
Zapata so far as known made no move
to accept and this may have "been re
rpoiiHible for Villa's declnlon to march
on Columbus alone.
.Villa in the letter attributed hla defeat
at Agua Prieta last November . to the
action of the United States government In
permitting Carranza military authorities
to send over American territory reinforce
ments for the Mexican town opposite
Pouglaa, Ariz., and declared that act an
invasion of the sovereignty of Mexico
and an inault to the people.
"At that time," Villa told Zapata, "I
restrained, but w'lth the greatest diffi
culty, the Impulse of my troops to at
tack the city of lJouglas."
CarTanza, he also stated In the letter,
had sold Mexico to the United States,
greeing to lease Magdalena bay for
alnety-nlne years and giving over con
trol of the Mexican National railroad.

OF VILLA BANDITS
Detachment that Followed Villa
Into Mexico Thursday is Doing
Patrol Duty.
HUNDRED MEXICANS KILLED
COLUMBUS, N. M., March 10.
Army border patrols and armed civ
ilians early todny maintained a close
watch for the reappearance of Mex
ican bandits along the border. A
report that armed Mexicans had ap
peared opposite Gibson's ranch, fif
teen miles west, was being investi
gated by military authorities. Im
mediately, upon reeclpt of this re
port a .considerable body of armed
civilians left here in automobilen.
Unconfirmed reports of the appear
ance ot Mexicans near Victoria also
ere received. 1
" Soldleiw-and citizens-dlrtded attention
to the vigil along the International bound
ary with the work of clearing yesterday's
battlefield of Mexican dead. Early today
approximately seventy-five Mexican dead
had been found on the American aide and
either burned or buried. This was ponted
to by American officials as. an evidence
of the effectiveness ft the fire of Amer
ican trooper.
Itandred Mexloaas Killed.
Major Frank Tompkins, who yesterday
afterward, returned to Columbua with
troopers that followed Villa Into Mexico,
estimated the Mexican ded in the battle
with Villa's rear guard at fully 100.
Several wounded Mexicans who had lain
out all night were found In the brush and
taken to the army hospital.
Lack of field telegraph and telephone
equipment, it was learned, was responsi
ble for the delay In the arrival at Colum
bus of two troops of cavalry from the
station at the Gibson ranch. Word of the
Columbus fighting waa not received there
until 8 o'clock. Althdugh Major Llndsley

taken Immediately following recognition

FUNSTON ASKS FOR
IMMEDIATE ACTION
General in Command at Border
Urges No Time Be Lost in Mot-
ing Against Bandits.
WANTS THINGS KEPT SECRET
WASHINGTON, March 10, In a
report late this afternoon General
Funston told the War department he
had accurate information that Villa
had 3,000 troops with him, that Car
ranza troops in his vicinity- had fled
and that he advised against "fritter
ing away the time of the army guard
ing small towns," while Villa might
have an opportunity to escape. He
advised that. the plans of tho army,
for Villa's capture be surrounded
with secrecy for the sake of their
success. -
Mountain Batteries Available. '
- Approximately lfc.OOO troops, with
forty-eight mountain batteries and
field guns, are on t,he border be
tween Douglas. Ariz., and El Paso,
Tex. A little more than one-third
of that force is cavalry and all could
be assembled at any- point- between
the two towns within two days. The
cavalry and a battalion of mountain
artillery with twelve mountain guns,
especially designed for the character
of fighting which the punitive ex
pedition will wage, could be assem
bled within twenty-four hours.
Search May Be Difficult.
The Thirteenth, Seventh, Eighth and
Tenth cavalry are scattered along the
border between Douglas and Kl Paso.
The Eleventh, Eighteenth and Twenty-
second Infantry, the Sixth field artillery
and a battalion of the Fourth mountain
artillery are at Douglas. At El Paso,
about sixty miles from Columbus, are
four regiments of Infantry, the Sixth,
Seventh, Sixteenth and Twentieth. The
Twelfth Infantry Is at Nogales between
Columbus and Douglas.
The administration realises that the
search for Villa may be long and diffi
cult. Major General Funston, however,
who probably will direct the expedition.
If he does not actually lead It, estab
lished himself as a successful catcher of
outlaws In the Philippines when he took
Agulnaldo single-handed.
There Is little expectation that Villa and
his bandits will fight In the open. Guer
illa' warfare la almbst certain to result,
but the American solillere will have or
ders to follow Villa no matter where he
goes.
The text of the dlspntch from General
Funston follows:
"It la the opinion of Colonels Dodd and
Hlocum, in which I concur, that unless
Villa is relentlessly pursued and his
forces scattered he will continue raids.
As troops. of the Mexican government
are accomplishing nothing and as he can
consequently n.ake his preparations and
concentrations without being disturbed,
be can strike at any point on the border,
we being unable to obtain advance In
formation as to his whereabouts.
Time la Valuable.
"If we fritter away the whole command
guarding towns, ranches and railroads It
will accomplish nothing, if he can find
sare refuge serous the line after every
raid. Although probably not more than
a thousand took part In the Columbus

A-y
Into United States in October
The citizens, according to the alleged
agreement, promised to take up arms
with Villa to gain this end. Villa was
to furnish the Mexicans of the dlxtriit
with live stock, to be delivered by April,
U16, "after he bad overcome Carransa
a.nd established himself as supreme chief
In Mexico."
Another of the papers acknowledged re
ceipt of ai,0o0 In gold from the Consoli
dated Cananea Copper company at Naco,
Honors, shortly after Villa's retreat from
Agua Prieta. The receipt credited th
money to export djtle on copper ores
from Cananea. but a notation showed that
the money really was paid for the lives
of three Americana held as prisoners
and who at the time, were reported to
have been. marked for execution.

CARRANZA TO SEND 5,000 MEN
IIISIIKK, Ariz., March 10. An
American rancher waa killed by a
linnd of 200 Mexican bandits who
crossed the border near Onbonie
Junction, Ariz., tonight.
WASHINGTON, March 10. Amer
ican troops were ordered across the
Mexican border today by President
Wilson to take Francisco Villa and
his b.mdlta, dead or alive.
Under the direction, if not actually
the leadership of Major General
Funston. who ended the Thlllpplno
insurrection by taking Agnlnadlo
single-handed, Amerncan columns
are expected to be moving into
Mexico before tomorrow night. They
go to meet about 3,000 guerrila
troops in a mountainous region, from
which Carranza troops have fled. No
less than 5,000 men, probably more.
will comprise tho American expedi
tion. Whether this long-deferred
armed action, which begins purely as
a punitive emasure to clear northern
Mexico of menacing bandit bands
over which Genearl Carrania has no
control, shall grow Into a general
armed intervention or occupation in
Mexico depends in a large measure
upon General Carranza and the
Mexican people.
Wllaoa's Statement.
It begins with Preeident Wilson's
declaration that it Is entirely to aid
the Carrania Government and with
out thought of aggression. This state
ment, prepared by th epresldent,
himself, was given out at the White
House:
An adequate force, will be, ,
sent at once in pursuit ot Villa, :"
with the'alngle object t cap-'
taring him and putting a, stop
to his forays, '
1 This can be done, and will be
done. In entirely friendly and
aid of the constituted author
itiea In Mexico, and with scrupu
lous respect for the sovereignty
of that republic.
President Wilson's decision to de
part from, the policy of watchful
waiting, hastened by the Columbus
massacre yesterday, was announced
today after it had been unanimously
approved by the cabinet and admin
istration leaders In congress.
Position Kxplalwed.
Tha president's1 position waa explained
fully to the latter, who agreed that ha
should not be embarrassed at this time
by discussions of a minority which
might arouse trouble In Mexico.
After a brief cabinet meeting, at which
the president waa described aa being de
termined to eliminate Villa as he was to
eliminate Huerta, Secretary Baker hur
ried to the War department and as his
