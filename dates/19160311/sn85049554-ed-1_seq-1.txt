Washington, March 11. General
Carranza, thru Consul Silllman, has
asked'the American government for
permission to send Mexican troops
across the border and Into the United
States in pursuit of bandits.
Consul 'Silliman transmitted the fol
lowing communication dated at Quad-,
alajara, March 10, whioh was handed
to him by Jesus Acuna, Carranza's
minister for foreign affairs. It is a
reply to the American government's
representations for permission to pur
sue the Villa bandits with American
forces.
"tin due reply to your coifrteous note
dated yesterday and transmitted today
thru Mr. John W. Belt (Sllllman'a sec

you that having brought the above
note to the attention of the first chief

you may in turn transmit it to tbjB de

eigners, ever since Frano|ico Villa ap
peared in the mountains of the above
named state, at 'the request of the gov
ernor of the state and of the constitu

first chief ordered the timely-depart

LuIs Gutierrez, with instructions to
actively pursue the bandits who had*
just crossed the line to American, ter
ritory, whioh they_ undoubtedly did,
compelled by the pursuit(of the .above
mentioned forces.
Ancient History Is Recalled.
"The above lamentable incident Is
similar to the Incursions made. into
the states of Sonora and Chihuahua
by Indiana from the reservations of the
government of the United States. In
cursions into the state of iSonora oc
curred more or less about the year
1880, when Geronimo, the Indian chief,
who died hot many years ago, led a
numerous horde and invaded apart of
the north of the state of Sonora, com
mitting many murders, and until, af
ter a long chase by American and
Mexican forces, the band was cap
tured.
"The Incursion Into Chihyahua, led
by ths Indian chi*f Vistsris, cc^sss&itd
ing about 800 Indians, took place be
tween the years. 1884 and 1880. Then
the bahds of maurauders committed
also many crimes, went ipto the opurf=~
try near the capital of Chihuahua and
during the first formal encounter'be
tween them and Mexican forces, after
having lost their ehief, they were dis
persed.
Co-operation Is Desired^--'-''~*
"On these two cases, thru an agl-ee
nrent it was decided that the armed
forces of one or the otber country
might freely cross to the territory of
one or the other in puihiuit and 'for
the purpose of punishing,"the band? of
maurauders. Recalling these incidents
and the good results for both coun
tries, the government presided over, by
the first chief, anxious tb extertMliq^Ms,

Columbus,
N.

being Villa spies divided Interest
among civilians here today with the
preparations of the military forces tor
th* pursuit of F*rancisco Villa and his
bandits. The American soldiers, offi
cers and men. In their preparatory ac
tivities, displayed an eagerness for the
receipt of the order that would start
them in Mexico.
Despite the nervousness among
civilians Qjgiet prevailed in the border
district during the night and in prac
tically every case circulated reports of
the appearance of hostile Mexicans
were shown to be unfounded.
8entry Kills Mexican.
Early in the night a Mexican re
fused to obey the command of an
American sentry to halt. The Mexi
can was killed.
Scouts brought in reports that Villa
was at Boca Grande, twenty-five miles
southwest of here. Other advices
stated that a large number of Car
ranza troops had reached Palomas,
supposedly to assist in the pursuit of
Villa.
Among the Mexicans "arrested for
spying was Pablo Gonzales. When
taken he wore overalls over a military
uniform.

El Paso, Tex., March 11.—The posl

colony in the Casas Grandes district.
Chihuahua, 158 miles from El Paso,
critical as it was In the first place,
has been further menaced by the
presence of Villa with a band of 300
followers at La Ascenclon, close to the
railrond over which they must travel
to the safety of the American frontier.
Carranza guards from Chihuahua
City were expected to accompany a
trainload of refugees due to leave
Casas Granges for the north today.
JThe natural covers of the land near
La Ascenclon however, afford protec
tion should Villa attack the train.
In E! Fnso hope "for the escape of
the Mormons is based largely on the
unverified rumor that Villa is short of
ammunition. Altho 300 men are re
ported to be with him at La Ascenclon,
Villa still has a force of 2,000 in that
region.
Awaiting Escort.

Mormons from their colony near Casus

years old.
When the escort may arrlve^he does

Villa is near Ascension within easy

which the refugees must pass.
General Gavira received word today
that General (Jtitlerrez, In command at

from 300 to 900 men each at San

Washington, March 11.—Consul Os

when the Norwegian bark Stilus from
New York to Havre, was torpedoed
without warning in Havro roads on the
night of March 9, seven Americans
aboard were rescued.
The loss of the Silius was first re

members of the crew were reported

State department officials seemed In
clined to view the attack on the Sillus
as a serious affair.
So far

dispatches to the state depart­

torpedped without warning. No men­
was made of the nationality of the
submarine and there was nothing to
whether the vessel was de­

mine.
If she was torpedoed sueh attack was
contrary to the assurances the United
