filed with the county commissioners
last Monday and accepted by that
V)ody.
Introductory to hla detailed state
ment!; Mr. Whimore said: 'There is
little comment required on the respec
tive offices. All moneys due your
couniy that have been collected from
various sources have been duly paid
into your county ' treasurer, and re
cord of such collections shown by
said official.
. "It is m? recommendation to your
honorable board that any subsequent
audits that be made, that you author
ize tha accountant to check the hooks
as to income and collections of
your Call ante water supply system.
From this source considerable reve
nue is derived, but without checking
the books of the system, no correct
idea can be given, whether or not
the total revenua properly feollsctable,
has been collected or remitttd to
your county treasurer, and as long as
this is an adjunct cf your county, the
checking of th9 books of this system
should properly come under the au
d t of the county.',
Tha audi' or suggested an improve
ment in the manner of collecting
fees in some of the offices and in
the manner of drawing warrants for
postage. He also recommended we
purchase of a fee book such as is
: genetalyl used in other counties.
. Mr. Whi mrre gave a very conr
plele tabulated statement of the fi
nances i f the county and gives much
; Interesting information from which
.the following is taken: .
The taxable yaluatl:n of property
'in tie county in 1914 was $1,261, C0f,
.from which taxes to the amount of
;$73,735.35 were charged against tax
payers. . Of this amount $39,470.96
Tvas CJllected in the first install
ment: while the taxes delinquent
were $797.79.' Poll taxes to the
amount of $645 were charged on the
tax roll during the year 1914.

rate for the year 1916, which was in
dicated in the item In a previous lssu
of the Record would be the case,
the general county rate will be. slight

The advance is due principally to the

Profits f the American copper pro
ducing companies in the year 1916 are
so far beyond all records that a heavy
burden is placed on any conservative
statistician who labors to avoid tne
taint of sensationism. It Is estimatea
that American Copper companies will
earn $300,000,000 net profits in lib.
With the expectation that the de
mands of the war alone will add $25,
000,000 to. the .value of Utah's metil
output in 1916, production has taken
a stride quite unusual in January and
early in February, proverbially a per

year is expected to reach $60,000,000
or even $70,000,000.
