Berlin, March 11 Announcement of, successes in many
quarters is embodied in the official statement issued this after
noon, by the war office.
Chief of these is capture of French positions 14 hundred
yards wide and about two-thirds of a mile deep south of Ville-
"Aux-Bois,, near Rheims. .
The text of the statement follows:
"Western front: Saxon regiments
stormed with very slight losses
strongly fortified positions- in the
wooded section southwest and south
of Ville-Aux-Bois. , 11 miles northwest
of Rheims over a width of about 1,400
yards and a depth of about two-thirds
of a mile.' Twelve uninjured officers
and 725 uninjured men fell into our
hands. The booty consisted of one re
volver cannon, five machine guns and
1 3 mine throwers. ..
"On the western bank of the Meuse,
(Verdun region) the last positions
still held by the French in the Bois
Des Corbeaux and the. Bois De Cum

warning; it is claimed,, near Havre,
assa been saved, according to reports
to the agents of the line in this city.
Norah was one of the crew. The
bark carried no passengers.
The Americans were David Sher
man,', of Bedford; John Warbman, of
Philadelphia; -Daniel Norah, of Con
necticut, and Henry Monahan, of Bos
ton. . -., "
The bark, which was commanded by
Captain A. B. Syvertsen, sailed from
New -York, Feb. ; 4, for Havre, with a
cargo of 2,200 tons of barley shipped
from San Franciscd.-f -: - . t

AMERICANS ARE SAVED
ON NORWEGIAN BARK
' Washington, March 11 Consul Os
borne at Havre reported today that
when the Norwegian bark Silius, from
New York - to Havre, was torpedoed
without warning in Havre roads on
the night of March 9 seven Americans
aboard were rescued.
The loss of the Silius was first re
ported last night from London. Three
members of the crew were reported
lost. , ' '
State department .officials seemed
inclined to Tjyiew the attack on the
sinus as a serious arrair.
So far, despatches to the state de
partment have simply said the vessel
was torpedoed without warning. No
mention was made of the nationality
of the submarine and there was noth
ing to, indicate whether a torpedo
actually was responsible for the sink
ing of a vessel, orw nether she might
have struck a mine.' It was presumed,
however, that the American consul at
Havre got his information from mem
bers of the crew, some of whom were
Americans. The department will take
immediate steps to get positive infor
mation.
If the Silius was torpedoed such an
attack was contrary to the assurances
the United States has secured tfrom
the central powers.
Secretary Lansing said no . action
would be taken until the state depart
ment had full information.

SILIUS IS SUNK
The Petit Parisien ' says that one of
the Americans on the , Silius was in
jured seriously in his legs and was

John Hartmann, 18 years old.
The Silius was a 1,500 ton three-
master, formerly the bark Helly. It
was reported that Captain Syvertsen,
of the Silius, was drowned and that
two sailors are missing. The remain
ing' members of the crew were saved.

FIVE EPISCOPAL
PARISHES WILL
HOLD MISSIONS
Elimination of Confusion
and Vagueness Object of
General Services.
BISHOP BREWSTER TO
TALK AT ST. JOHN'S
Visiting Rectors Will Deliv
er Sermons on Topics of
Import
The bishops of the Episcopal ' church
have called on their clergy and people
throughout the nation to hold a mis
sion sometime this year, in every com
munity wher the Episcopal church is
established. The diocese of Connecti
cut, like the. majority of other dio
ceses, will hold its mission during this
present Lent.
Of the seven parishes in Bridgeport,
only two will not hold a mission, be
cause ot the absence of rectors. The
other five, St. Luke's on the East Side,
Trinity, Christ church and St. John's
in . the center of the city, and St.
George's in . the West. End, each will
hold its own mission for its own peo
ple! and its neighbors, this coming
week.
The idea is, that there is throughout
the country a general confusion and
vagueness as to -the real contents of
the Christian "religion . One character
istic of America is, there are so many
different versions of Christianity that
the public cannot find the Christian
faith. The ibishops of the Episcopal
church felt that it was someone's duty
to institute a systematic, intelligible,
authentic instruction of religion for
all who would . appreciate it. And
they called upon the'r clergy to ar
range such an instruction, and to offer
it to all people, of any church or no
church.
A mission is very much like what in
Protestant communions Is called a
"Revival," but with stronger empha
sis on? teaching. Its services are en
tirely unliturgical, that is, informal.
They consist - of congregational sing
ing, extempore prayer, an instruction
and a sermon, and frequently a "question-box,"
which always interests the
public and throws light on their own
questions. "
A mission-is a progressive affair, ev
ery service having its own place and
importance in the course. To get the
benefit it is 'essential that one start
at the beginninsr and. co trrwtnsr'h with-.
out a break: It is important that
those Who are habitually not interested
in religion shall be drawn into the
mission by those who are.
It will be intensely 'nteresting to
see how the members of the Episcopal
church throughout the country take
hold of this great offensive, and also
how. .largely it succeeds in getting the
people at large into this, its first gen
eral mission.
St. George's church in the West End
wijl hold the mission every night of
next week except Saturday. The open
ing service is at 7:30 p. m. on Sun
day, March 12; and the week-day ser
vices will be held; at 8 o'clock each
evening, t .
The missioner at TTt. George's will
be the Rev. Frank H. Bigelow, rector
of Lime Rock, Conn., whowill be as
sisted by the rector. of the parish, Rev.
Henry E. Kellyl
A mission is intended quite as much
for the general public as for the par
ishioners of the church in which it is
held. The Rector's Guild has under
taken to pay all the expenses. ,
The principal services are those in
the evening, but there will also be
celebrations of Holy Communion dally
at 7:30 and 10 a. m., and a mission
service for school, children on Friday
at 4 o'clock. . '
At St. John's church there will be
daily Holy Communion at 9:45 a. m.
On Monday,' Tuesday and Wednesday
services will also be held at 10:30
a. m." and 5 p. m. Rev. Charles A.
Tibbals, rector of St. John's church,
Sandy Hook, will be the missioner.
The subjects and the days for the
morning services will be: Monday,
"The Temptation of Bread"; Tues
day, "The Temptation of Pride," and
Wednesday, , "The Temptation of
Power." The afternoon service sub
jects will be "Leaving Home and the
Far Country'; Tuesday, "Losing and
Finding Oneself," and on Wednesday,
"The Lost Righteousness." ,
Perhaps the most important series
of services during Lent in the Episco
pal churches will be the Bishop's ser
vices, held at St. John's church on
Tuesday evenings, beginning March
21. These services at which Bishop
Chauncey B. Brewster of this diocese
will speak, will be open to everyone.
They will begin promptly at 8 o'clock,
opening with a short prayer service. A
men's chorus will sing at the services.
Rev. Kenneth MacKenzie, rector of
Christ Episcopal church, Westport,
will conduct the mission services' at
St. Luke's church on Stratford ave
nue and Sixth street.
Services will be held every evening
except Saturday at 7:45. Special ser
vices for children will be held at 4
o'clock on Friday afternoon and for
men on Sunday afternoon at the same
hour. An orchestra will play the ac
companiment for the hymns. There

ELI GRADUATES
PLEDGE SELVES'
TO PREPARATION
Yale alumni throughout the Con
necticut and ew York are advocat
ing preparedness through education.
This movement reached . Bridgeport
last night through a reunion of the
class of 1895, held in the Yale club,
New York city last night.
At this reunion the Yale method,
as advocated by Cornelius Vanderbilt,
was again broached with the result
that Compensation Commissioner Ed
ward T. Buckingham and Mortimer F.
Comstock of this city have pledged
themselves to propogate the new "pre
paredness idea" as disclosed by "Van
derbilt in person last night.
The suggestion, which has met
with general approbation in military
and civflian circles, is that arrange
ments be made with the United States
military authorities to have officers
lecture publicly upon military tac
tics and other necessary adjuncts to
warfare. By this means the tech
nique necessary in warfare wilT be
mastered by all, and with the possible
introduction of military courses in the
public schools will lead to great
theoretical efficiency in time of ne
cessity. It is likely that under the stimulus
of Buckingham and Comstock, active
measures towards procuring the nec
essary military lectures for Bridge
port will be taken.
The Grand Trunk is reported to
have declared an embargo on. all
grain shipments.
VILLA SOLDIERS
TO BE TRIED ON
MURDER CHARGES
Columbus, N. M., March 11 Seven
wounded Villa soldiers captured by
Col. ,H. J. Slocum's troopers of the
13th U. S. Cavalry in Thursday battle
here will be charged with murder for
the killing of the seven American
soldiers slain in the fight, according
to an announcement today -by E. B.
Stone, special agent of the depart
ment of justice. The prisoners in
clude a boy 12 years old and two of
ficers. Stone said he would confer
today with Summer Burkhart, TJ. S.
District Attorney of New Mexico and
that the charges probably would name
Francisco Villa who led the raid- on
Columbus.
The men against whom murder
charges are to be filed are: Pablo
Garcia, a . captain who has fought in
Villa's army for three years; Lieut.
Yzabel Chavez, with two years' ser
vice under the insurgent chief, Leno
Rouez; Elias Meras, and Antonio
Morandes, privates. . The boys is
Jesus Rayes, who with his father
Ausleto Rayes, joined Villa three
months ago in Chihuahua.
The death of Jesse Taylor, a wound
ed American soldier, yesterday at
Fort Bliss, will be the basis for the
eighth charge of : murder against the
prisoners who are all so badly wound
ed that a United States commissioner
probably will be summoned from
Deming or Albuqurque , to arraign
them as they lie in a hospital tent in
camn here.
Stone declared , the cases against
the prisoners had 'been rendered par
ticularly strong by the fact that evi
dence had been found, including pa
pers taken from Villa's official corre
spondence which was picked up on
the battlefield to show that while Vil
la was approaching to make the raid
on. Columbus' he. addressed his troops.
telling them to spare no American, to.
burn and loot the town and to make
"human torches of every man, woman
and child." ,
Jose Sanchez was picked up with
15 other Mexicans yesterday by cav
alry patrols. Fourteen were releas
ed, some being ordered across the
border as suspicious characters. San
chez claimed to be a rancher but
American soldiers made ' affidavits
that he was signalling across the bor
der. When he was searched a pair
of field glasses was found under his
blue jumper. Removal of his overalls
revealed a well-made gray military
uniform.

Ariz., stated that a command of Car
ranza soldiers who had been drinking,
were encamped for the night near Os
born, while on the way from Naco,
Sonora, to Auga Prieta, Sonora. They
amused themselves by. roping cattle
and horses belonging to the American
ranchers, whose property extended
both sides of the international bound
ary. Several horses and cattle ranging in
Arizona were roped and dragged
across the border. Other livestock
which- was roped and which the sol
diers were- unable to get across the
border was shot on Arizona soil. The
Mexicans did not cross the line them

Washington, March 11 The am
bassadors from Chili and Brazil, who
took part in the Pan-American con
vention which resulted in the recogni
tion of General Carranza, called on
Secretary Laising today to inquire
about 'the action of the United States.
They were informed but made no
comment. ;

the Senate committee on foreign relations formally extended to
President Wilson, plans for the
to run down the band of Villista raiders went forward with ra
pidity today.
Major General Frederick Funston announced at San An
tonio, today that he personally will not direct the expedition.
A brigadier general, whose name he said would be announc
ed in Washington, will. take charge. He added that organiza
tion of the expedition will not be completed for two or three
days, as troops from army divisions other than the southern
will be added to the border forces.
It was- generally understood that Brig. General John J,
Persching will command the troops in the pursuit of Villa.
Go-operation between the Garranza forces and United
States troops is indicated by a request, officially delivered,
through Consul Silliman, from the Garranza government for
permission to despatch Garranza troops into American territory,
if emergencies arise through which the capture of raiders would
thus bexpedited.
Meantime comes from Malpias, 18 miles. east of Columbus,
the report of another raid. Eighteen mounted Mexicans are re
ported as having raided the hpme of H. A. Blar.kcnship, a sec
tion foreman. The family, including two children, escaped in
to underbrush, and spent the night in cold and darkness, but
are little the worse for their experience.
Secretary Baker said that whatever
reinforcements General Funston might
require to maintain an adequate patrol
along the border in addition to the ex
peditionary force would be promptly
furnished. He added that the war de
partment had been deluged, with tele
grams from individuals and organiza
tions offering services and volunteers.
There was at present, Secretary Ba
ker said, no need for summoning vol
unteers to the colors, although the de
partment appreciated fully the pa
triotic spirit behind the offer.

Washington, March ' 11 General
Carranza; through Consul Silliman,
has asked the American government
for permission to send Mexican troops
across the border and into the United
States in pursuit of bandits.
Consul Silliman transmitted the
following communication . dated at
Guadalajara, March 10, which was
handed to him by J. Acuna, Carranza's
minister for f or'elgn affairs. - It is a
reply to the American government's
representations for permission to pur
sue the Villa bands with . American
forces: . .
"In due reply to your courteous
note, dated yesterday and transmitted
today through Mr. John . W. Bait,
(Silliman's secretary) I will say I
have the honor to inform you that I
have brought the . above note to the
attention of the first chief of the
Constitutionalist army and in the his

has directed me to say to you to the
end that you may,- in turn, transmit
it to the department of state of the
American government, that he learn

Columbus, N. M., on account of the
assault it suffered yesterday from the
bandits led by Francisco Villa.
"That although there has been a

foreigners, ever since Francisco Villa
appeared in the mountains of the

many years ago in Fort Mount, Ala.,

part of the state of Sonora, commit

of the life and property of many
Mexicans. After a long and tenacious

"The - incursion into Chihuahua led
by the Indian chief, Victoria,, com
manding about 800 Indians, took place
between the years 1884 and 1886. Then
the bands . of marauders, committing
also many crimes, went into the coun
try as-far as the villages of Tejolochio
or Tres Castillos, very near the capi
tal of Chihuahua, and during the first
formal encounter between them and
Mexican forces, after having lost their
chief, they were dispersed.
"In these two occasions through an
agreement between the governments
of the United States and Mexico it was
decided that the armed forces of one
and the other country might freely
cross from the territory of one to the
other in pursuit and for the purpose
of punishing the above named bands
of marauders. Recalling these pre
