than he had felt for some time. He ate
a fairly good supper and seemingly
rested quite well during the night. In
the early morning he spoke to his wife
and asked her if she had rested well
during the night. In answering she
noticed he was breathing badly. In
about ten minutes from that time, he
was gone.

sister, all of whom were present except
one brother who was in Billings, Mon
tana, and couldn't be at the funeral.
He also leaves a host of friends to
mourn his loss. The floral tributes
from friends, relatives and organiza
tions, were beautiful. He has been
traveling salesman for the Garden City
Seeder Company, and was at one time
traveling salesman for the Port Huron

David Clay.
On the 6th of March David Clay died.
He was an old man. No one seemed to
know his age. He had no relatives liv
ing here. He was poor, the county
took him to the hospital, and then
buried him. He always seemed, to be a
man of mystery. No one was a clcsa
friend to him. He had seen better
days. He was well educated but some
thing in his life seemed to have poison
ed his view of. humanity. Thus passed
away one of the strange unique charac
ters of our western civilization.

Through the courtesy of the editors
of the Normal Leader the Free Press is
enabled to print some of the doings at
the annual meeting of the G. B. E. A.
in this city this week. This, the
twentieth meeting of the association,
has been the largest and most success
ful of any that have preceded it. So
large has been the attendance that the
present auditorium at the Normal was
entirely inadequate, but next year
President Lewis promises that the
Sheridan Coliseum will be completed
and in readiness for the largest meet
ing of any teacher's meeting ever held
:n the state. Work will soon be com
menced on fhe new building.
Awakening Factors in Trego.
A few events of educational interest
in the past three years of Trego county:
"Joint Session of Teachers Institute
with Ellis County at the Fort Hays
Normal School" teachers awoke to the
importance of receiving training for
their work. Now 90 per cent of teach
ers employed in the county have had
special training before beginning teach
ing.
"Common School Commencement
Day." More intereft taken by boys
and girls to complete the common
school work because of the "Gradu
ating Day" made especially enjoyable
for them. Last summer motion pic
turrs cf the activities of the day were
taken which highly delighted the young
sters.
"County Meetings of School Boards"
The officers enjoyed coming together.
Greater interest taken since in improv
ing and beautifying schools.
"Five Day Session of Institute"
last week in August Teachers became
acquainted with county superintendent
and with each other. Enthusiasm, in
spiration and healthy rivalry gotten
and better school work resulted.

Optimistic Thought.
Hatred in the heart is a great bur

Balsa Wood Like Cork.
The balsa wood is a very light wood
which grows in large quantities in tht
tropical regions of Central and South
America. It weighs as little or less
than cork, but has a noticeable grain
It dry rots with comparative quick
ness unless treated. It Is useful for
any purpose where a buoyant material
is required.
Highest Park of United States.
A tract of 3S0 square miles near
Zstes park county, recently set aside
asx a national forest reserve, is the
highest of Uncle Sam's parks, two
mi. as in air. It contains 203 lakes,
and is bo beautiful that Lord Dun
raven, an Engliehman, who explored it
fifty years ago. employed an artist an i
a special writer to paint and describe
its wonders.
Criticism of Modern Ways.
Today the tendency Is, not to en
deavor to make youths strong to re
sist, but to try to remove all stress
from them. They must not be given
hard tasks at chool; indeed, the cry
i3 that children must feel that school
is play. TLey must not be taught
obedience and respect, lest they be
servile. They must have much amuse
ment. All this Is dependent upon the
idea that life is meant for pleasure
and that work i3 a curse. Dr. Charles
W. Burr.
