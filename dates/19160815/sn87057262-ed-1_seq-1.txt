BERLIN, (via wireless to SayvHle,
[L I.) Aug. 16.—German Zeppelins
wfli punish England for her failure
to punish the crew of the British
I steamer Baralong, which killed mem
bers of a German submarine crew
after they had been made prisoners,
it was officially announced here to
day.
In the future Zeppelins raiding
English .towns will have no consider
ation for the lives of civilians otbei
than that demanded by international
law.
The government today made known
its position in transmitting to the
Beichstag a white book on the Bara
case containing the official Ger
J&9A .-and British documents. The
ffiflatteptirt aaya:
"The German government replying
to the declarations of the British gov
ernment about the German memoran
dum of January 10, 1916, on the Bara
long case decided that on account of
ftie British government's revolting at
titude, it was Impossible to continue
the negotiations. At the same time
it announced that It would itself take
reprisals corresponding to the provo
cation.
"The German government on the
other hand declined to retaliate for
the crimes committed by British sea
men by bringing similar reprisals—
for instance, shooting British war
prisoners. But German airships will
have convinced the English people
that Germany is able to atone for the
cruelties perpetrated by the officers
and crew of the'Baralong.
"If. formerly, the unavoidable dan
ger for the civilian population was
particularly considered when using
German Zeppelins for military pur
poses, such regards are no more re
prisals in the face of the Baralong
murder (the text as sent by wireless
is not clear at this point.) Since
then the arm of tfte air ship has
been used against England within the
limits of the law of nations without
any such regard. In every airship
that throws destructive bombs on
London or other defended towns or
roch that contain establishments of
military character, England shall re
member the Baralong case."
The British patrol ship fcarafong
aank a German submarine in August,
1914. The submarine crew was cap
tured, but bra light aboard the Bara
long the exact details of which are
not known, the submariners were
killed. According to stories from
German sources they were kicked off
the patrol boat into the water or shot.
According to a British report, Ameri
cas muleteers, who had been rescued
by the Baralong, after their ship had
been submarined, killed the Germans.
Germany demanded an explanation
of what she termed the "Baralong
murder." Great Britain countered
with the proposal that a board of
neutrals Investigate the raralong af

PHTROORiAD, Aug. 16.—The Jtaa
sians have pierced the new Austwo
German line on the Zlota Upa river
at a new point, having crossed to the
west bank of the river in a twelve
mile advance from the upper Strlpa,
it was officially announced today.
The new Austro-German line, along
the Zlota Idpa river, to which Gen
eral Bothmer retreated from the river
Stripa, is giving way tinder heavy
Russian pressure.
'Russian forces have crossed the
Zlota L/ipa in the north, and are at
tacking Bothmer*s army. The Austro
Germuns are making desperate, ef
forts to throw the czar'e troops back
to the east bank.
In the south, the Russians ap
proaching Halitz are several miles
west of the Zlota Llpa, and seriously
threaten Bothmer's right flank and
rear. Unless the Russian advance is
speedily checked, the AustroOer
mans must continue their retreat un
til they reach the Gnteta lipa liver,
a retirement of nearly tfhlrty-flve
miles on a wide front.
The Austrians have almost entire
ly ceased their attacks. In the ex
treme southeast, near the Carpath
ians, according to advices from the
front today. Ten days ago, the ar
rival of strong bodies of Austrian and
German reinforcements was followed
by heavy attacks that caused the
Russian line to retire slightly. It is
now believed that these reinforce
ments have been withdrawn and are
being hurried to the defense of Lem
berg by a round about rail route
south of the Carpathians.

In fact, Germany Expects to Increase
the Allowance of Rations,
so Food Censor
Says.
:.
[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN Aug, 15—Allied military
chieftains have attempted to aid the
"starve Germany out" campaign by
setting fire to German harvest fields,
according to reports received here.
The recent raids by Anglo-French
aviators over the Black* Forest and
farm lands near Karlsruhe are said to
have been experimental trips. In»
cendlary bombs were dropped in sev
ral fields with the evident object, of
ptarting great fires, but did only slight
damage.
Adolph Von Batockl, German food
"dictator" said today there is little
chance that the Plan will succeed.
"In the first place, the fields have
not been dry enough to enable them
to start a great fire," he said. "In the
second place, many of the crotis are
already in. In the third place, we
have no large farms like you have in
America and if small farms lost their
crops in this manner it would not af
fect the total. Don't forget, too, that
our aeroplanes are guarding our farms
as well as the trenches. Furthermore,
our biggest harvest—potatoes—can
not be burned because they are bur
led."
To Increase Rations.
Oats supply from the new harvest
is so good that horses' rations will be
Increased, Batoski said. The grain
crop is so good that bread rations will
be increased and the fodder prospects
are so excellent that Germany expets
to raise as large a stock of pigs this
fall as in peace times. By a special
arrangement between the government
and the cattle raisers, the latter must
deliver to the government so many
fat pigs in return^ for fodder, which
the government has monopolized. This
insures a certain supply of pork and
makes unnecessary the slaughtering
of milk cows unless they are dry.
"As the result of these steps, there
will be no shortage in milk," said
Batoski.
Expect to Seize Coal.
'PHJLADeJIiPHlA, Pa., Aug. 16.—
Coal now stored in Philadelphia in
great quantitlee will probably be
seized by tiio municipal authorities,
if railway brotherhoods call a strike.
It was announced at the office of Di
rector of Supplies McLaughlin today.
This action will be necessary, it is
stated,- to insure operation of the
water works, hospitals and other
puibttc institutions necessary to pub
lic health.
Patriotism Too Far.

LONDON, Aug. 15.—"I do not envy
the man who has the responsibility
for this war upon his conscience. I,
of least, am not that man. I think
history will clear me of that charge,
although I do not suppose that history
will hold me faultless."
Kaiser Wilhelm was today quoted
in a Berne, Switzerland dispatch to
the London Daily News as having
made this statement to a prominent
neutral who visited Berlin on business
of an official character last year and
made another visit last month.
"In a sense, every civilized man In
•Europe," the kaiser was further
quoted as saying, "must have a share
in the responsibility for this war and
the higher his position, the larger his
responsibilities. I admit that, and
yet claim that I acted throughout in
good faith and strove hard for peace,
even though war was inevitable."
The neutral was about to leave
Berlin when he and other members of
a special deputatldn, were invited to
tea with the kalserln and the kaiser,
who had Just returned from the west
ern front, the Berne dispatch said.
The kaiser entered, wearing a Ger
man field uniform and after indulging
in commonplaces about the weather,
turned to a discussion of th© war.
Somewhat to the embarrassment of
the neutral visitors, he suddenly put
the question:
"I suppose the British theory that I
was responsible for the war has got
a hold on your own people."
Before any of his guests could re-,
ply, the kaiser added.
"It is curious how this theory
seems to fascinate my enemies. Yet
the people who accuse me of having
caused the war are the very people
who previously testified to the earn*
estness of my desire for peace.
"Why is It that you neutrals al
ways talk about German militarism
and never about Russian despotismi
the •French craving for revenge or
English treachery?"

Governor Hughes Puts Person
al Touch to Hi a Utterances
in Washington, Using
Personal Pronouns.
TELLS WHAT HE'LL DO
Candidate Has But One Talk and He
Localizes This for Eaoh New'
Stop— Inefficiency Hla
Text Yesterday.
[By Perry Arfaold, United Prese Staff
Correspondent.]
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 16.—Gover
nor Hughes is putting the personal
punch into his speeches in Washing
ton. He began today to use the per
sonal pronoun in pledges and prom
ises.
"If you elect me to an executive
office," he told an audience here to
day, "I propose to use my full exe
ecutive influence."
This was the first time that the
republican nominee has used the in
timate personal pronoun. It was in
dicative of a (further step in the gov
ernor's "warming up" process. In
his speeches across the continent, so
far, the G. O. P. aspirant for presi
dential honors has heretofore con
fined himself to speaking of the
party. The only personal references
were veiled.
The governor has really only one
speech. It starts off with a ©lea for
unity of Americanism, touches on
preparedness, attacks democratic
policies on both matters swings to
the 'Mexican problem, jumps back to
an attack on the democrats for gov
ernmental inefficiency, "pork" meth
ods, and lack of co-ordination and
ends with a pledge of "better govern
ment" un/ler republican rule. Roose
velt usually had six different speeches
in his campaigning, and Taft at least
four. Both altered these stock
speeches to emphasize some differ
ent section. Hughes localizes his.
Inefficiency is Weapon.
Today, Hughes chose inefficiency
as his main battering ram in his as
sault against the democratic citadel.
But what was remarked by those who
have been associated with him since
the start of his campaign trip was
the extraordinary "polish" which the
nominee has now applied to this one
speech. It was a perfect indication
that the governor has now reached
the summit of his campaigning skill.
He put In new synonyms, new similes,
new epigrams—and consequently ho
got as big a reception here as any
where on the trip.
In addition to his Taooma speech
today, the governor was due to
speak tonight at Seattle's great out
door stadium. National Committee
man Perkins reported today that
tests showed there would be no
need of a sounding board to save the
governor's voice there.
Hughes was wildly cheered by
women In the audience which heard
his woman suffrage speeoh at Spo
kane yesterday. He declared that
equal soffrage was inevitable and
pledged his full support to the federal
woman suffrage amendment.
Enjoying Trip.

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
THE FOTLiD, July 20. (By mall.)—If
It's possible to Imagine dozens of
heavy thunderstorms blended Into
one continuous roar, the shrieking
and whining of tone of unseen steel
and high explosives flying through
the sky, lightning flashes of bursting
shells continuously specking the
horizon like a giant Fourth of July
display, then it's ipartly possible to
visualize the newest phase of war on
the western front
The United Press correspondent
saw and heard all this today from a
high stretch of ground, commanding
ibhe scene of a dozen of the bloodiest
and most lerrible conflicts of the
British drive. Dotting the gTeien
hills and valleys, here and there,
were distinct blotches of brown vis
ible among naked skeletons of trees.
These ugly 'blots on the landscape a
short time ago were pretty villages,
each with a church spire and. red
topped houses snuggled down be
tween the rolling hills. Today, they
were merely ugly -.toleta. -iBaohwiB
typical «f the other-^-mosfty a pile of
bricks that resembles nothing.
From the vantage point were ob
served Contalmalson, Bazentin-Le
Grand, Montauban, La Bolsselle,
Mammetz and several small woods
which have figured prominently in
the communiques. Just beyond the
range of vision lay Longuval and
Devllle wood, where at the moment
the Germans were engaged in a heavy
counter attack, wihlch gave them
back a part of the wood and a few
houses of the village. A British
counter attack soon reversed the sit
uation. Fighting of tihis character
has been a peculiarity of the British
offensive. AH captured points are
strongly held. Wherever the Ger
mans concentrate their reserves, and
carry out a oounter drive, any suc
cess they gain is of short duration.
The systematic British advances
makes it possible to retaliate quick
ly, usually in force.
(Precaution prevents publication of
news relative to troops and move
ments of troops, but it can be said
with safety that there is no shortage
of shells or men or guns behind the
British line. From the viewpoint of
the non-military observer there Is no
s'hertage of anything.
For nllles along the net work of
country roads, well behind the fight
ing lines, great masses of men in
khaki—most of them wearing the
picturesque steel helmet—are await
ing for their turn. Motor lorries in
great droves are also performing
their functions. Passing along the
roads miles and miles to the rear,
khaki is everywhere.
Peaceful little villages, which fate
has left so near the ravages of the
conflict yet still untouched, are filled
with It. Every doorway shows a
"Tommy." Every corner shows a
group of "Tommies." These men
are in billets. Many of them have
had their turn at the fighting, and
are taking a well earned rest. Oth
ers have freshly arrived from Eng
land as can he seen by the newness
