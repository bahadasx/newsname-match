BRANDEIS NOT
TO MEDIATE
Declines Position on Mexican
Commission-Court Rush
Prevents Acceptance.
Associate Justice Louis P. Brandles yes
terday declined to serve on the Mexican
Mediation Commission.
He called at the W-hite House person
ally to place his declination before the
President.
This action followed an interview with
Chief Justice White. at which the latter
objerted to partcipation by a member
of the I'nited States Supreme Court in
the Mexican Mediation (onference.
The White House last night gave out
the text of Justice Brandeis' letter of
declination. It follows:
"I appreciate the opportunity for high
service which membership on the Mex
'I ican Commission would present, but upon
consultation with the Chiif Justice. I
find the state of the business of the
Supreme Court at the presnt time to be I
such that it is my duty not to undertake
this important additional task.
"With deep regret.
"Faithfully yours.

The refusal of Justice lrandeis to serve
on the Mexican Commission will delay
further steps toward settlement otf the
