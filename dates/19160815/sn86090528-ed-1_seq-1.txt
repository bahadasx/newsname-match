THEY WANT
WORK FOR
LODGING
Many Girls in State Would Earn Board
and Room While Attending College;
Austin Wants Information
Places are wanted where fifty young
women, who are struggling for ail edu
cation and willing to do any kind of
work in order to get. It, can work for
board and room and go to school. The
College has on file now some fifty let
ters from girls in all parts of the Kate
who are anxious to attend tho school,
but whoso parents are unable to pay
their expenses.
Many of them, too, are orphan girls
who havo( been working their way
through high school and are attempt
ing to get a college education and pre
pare themselves to earn a living by
teaching in the music hall or the pub
lic school room. Some ot them have
been attending school, but their pa
rents have met financial reverses and
the girht have tho ambition to con
tfiiue their education on their own re
sources.
"Any kind of work in a good home"
Is the request that most of them make.
All they want is a clianco to earn
their board and room while they can
attend the Oklaboma College for Wo
men, whore they can luivo the advaii
tago ot the best Instruction to bo. ob
tained, and especially whoro they can

lessons.
"Those girls are the real cream of
the young womanhood of the utafe,"
President Austin said in asking for
places for thorn to work. "Any young
woman who has the ambition to work
for her board and room while, sho is
attending school deserves all the en
couragement that, can possibly be.glv
en her.
"We need these young women in the
school, too. They are tho ones who
usually stand at tho top in the class
work, and they are equally active in
the affairs of the student body.
"Other school towns, much smaller
than this one, furnish for these work
ing students every opportunity to earn
their board and room while they are
attending school. , Besides being a
help to the young women who are
struggling for an education, it is a
great advertisement for the school.
It shows that we stand for the right
Ideals."
All those wh'o will have work for
these young women this Winter are
requested to write to the College at
once, giving description of J;b work
desired and accommodations they can
offer the girls. Information should he,

court caused ail visions of a war baby
boom to vanish and the leather,
though cut into small strips by the ne
