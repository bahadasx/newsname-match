LOW RAILROAD
FARE TO FAIR
Agent Rice Secures Rate of One
Fare and a Third Jim Wright
To Manage Fair Dinner
- i
Excursion rates to the great K. of i
P. fair in Stanford next wee on
August 23, 24 and 25 have been
granted by the L. & N. railroad and
delegations from all points of the
compass are expected here tor seethe
big show. Local Agent J. b. Kice
took up the matter with his road and
secured a rate of one fare and a
third from points between Stanford
"and Lebanon, Stanford and Richmond
and Stanford and Corbin. The spec
ial fare applies to all round trip
tickets and will be good on all trains
coming into tanford on Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday. ,..,.
Arrangements were made late last
week bv which J. H. Wright, of this
city, will have charge of the dinner
which the fair will spread each day,
and this insures that a splendid meal
will be served each day. uo nam,
beaten biscuits, chicken ana ot"er
delicacies will be on the menu. Mr.
Wright will select his assistants from
the K. P. boys and as he is a hustler j
and all 'round live wire, uie iav.w
that he will have charge of this por
tion of the program means that there
will be something good to eat.
A great deal of interest in the
fair was manifested by court day
visitors Monday. The Stanford fair is
undoubtedly- the best advertised fair
to be held "in a country town in the
state this vear. Everybody seemed to
know about the fair and to remark:
"You fellows must be going to
have some fair this year the way ev
erybody is boosting it."
There is no doubt about there be
ing a large number of show horses
at the fair. Stalls for animal are
being engaged by the score and the
only trouble now is that there may
not be enough stalls to go aronud.
Everything points to a successful
fair If the weather man will just do
his part, all will be well. .
The handsome catalogues issued
in the I. J. office for the fair, which
begins Wednesday, Aug. 23, are go
ing like hot cakes. Hundreds have
been mailed to those who have re
quested them and each mail brings
more demands for them. Join ihj
majority and write for one, if yru
have not already done so.

Quite a number of Lincoln county
people attended the Mt. Vernon fair
and some of them took stock. As ,

Curtis wlnninir probably the most
ribbons. He had several head of
good horses and won nearly every
time he entered one of them. Bun
Gaines had no stock there but a mule
that was sired by his noted jack was
a big winner of the blue ties. The
fair was well attended and the show
of stock was all that could have been
expected. The crowd Thursday, the
largest in point of attendance, was
estimated at 2,500 to 3,000. There
were many attractions, free and
otherwise, and the accasion was one
long to be remembered. It was some
thing like a big picnic, where all
went in for a good time and had it.
The officers and directors were ex
ceedingly courteous to their guests
and did all in their power for the
delegation. Edgar Albright, editor
of the Signal, was untiring in looking
after the crowd, the show rings and
everything in and around the fair
grounds. He seemed to possess the
peculiar faculty of being in two or
three places at the same time and
doing good work in all of them.
W. H. Fish, the efficient and clever
secretary, ought to be re-elected by
an overwhelming majority for anoth
er year, or just as many years as he
will take the office. He is the right
man for the place. Quick, obliging,
painstaking and clever, he made a
secretary satisfactory to all and at
the same time made friends of all
with whom he came in contact.
It was a most creditable exhibition
and while the people of Rockcastle
generally are to be congratulated for
their work in making it so, tho Mes
srs. Albright and Fish should have the
lion's share of the credit and have
no doubt been given it. It was the
I. J.'s intention to print the list of
those who got the premiums, but a
lack of space forbids.
Miss Bertha Jackson
Accepts Place at Head of Expression
Department of School.
A telegram from Miss Bertha L.
Jackson to the Stanford School
Board late last week, conveyed the
information that she has accepted
the tender of the position as Expres
sion teacher in the local school, which
was made several weeks ago, when
Miss Esther Burch resigned the
position. The telegram was sent
from Glendale, Cal. where Miss Jack
son has been for the summer. The
fact that she will be a member .of
the faculty the coming term ilill be
pleasing news to her many friends.
She gave great satisfaction when in
charge of this department several
years ago, and will be cordially wel
comed back to Stanford. Supt. W.
C. Wilson and bride (formerly Miss
Gastineau) -are expected here -after
their bridal trip in the east, and
preparation will begin for the open
ing of school about Sept 1st. W. R.
Todd, who willl have charge of the
high school work, lias come from
his home in Columbia and will be a
strong addition to the faculty. Pros
spects for a most successful school
year are said to be very bright, and
probably the largest attendance in
the history of the local educational
institution is looked for.
GOOD WOMAN GONE
Mrs. Lela Padgett, aged 33 years,
died last Tuesday at Cincinnati. The
body was brought to her old home
near Waynesburg, where funeral

Point church. Rev. J. A. Singleton

tal remains of this food woman. Mrs.
Padgett was a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Zachariah Padgett, and the wife

more.

day.s When a medicine is jieeded
take Chamberlain's Tablets. They

Bub Engleman No More
Well Known Stanford Man's Suffer-
mgs
Relicved By Death.
R. C. Engleman, known to his
friends as "Bub" died at his apart
ments in the Odd Fellow's Building
Friday night of paralysis, aged 48.
Some months ago he suffered a
stroke and a week before his death
another came. His condition had
been alarming since then and his
friends and relatives were prepared
for the announcement of his death.
The decaesed was a son of R. C.
Engleman, who died about five years
ago. His mother was called away
many years before. A brother, John
W. Engleman, and a sister, Mrs. J.
S. Hundley survive. The former
came from Lexington to his bedside
l as soon as he heard of his serious
illness and remained with him to the
end. Mrs. Hundley also gave her
brother all of the attention possible
but they and his physicians could
not arrest the disease which was so
rapidly gnawing at his vitals.
Most of Mr. Engleman's life had
been spent in this immediate section.
He was a soldier in the war with
Spain and showed his patroitism by
offering his life for his country. He
was positive character, always loyal
to his friends and in turn they were
seemingly bound by hoops of steel
to him. There are many who are
saddened by his taking away and
much sympathy is felt for them.
The burial took place in Buffalo
cemetery at 10:30 Sunday morning
after brief services at the grave by
Dr. M. D. Early. Mr. Engleman was
very fond of the doctor and it was
his wish that he speak at his grave.
Prominent Mt. Salem Citizen Gone
Lincoln county lost a good citizen
when John Milford Eubanks died at
his home in the Mt. Salem section
Friday night of cancer of the face.
He was a quiet, industrious farmer
and very seldom came to town or
went anywhere. He loved home and
spent every moment there he could.
He was a devout member of the Bap
tist church. His wife, who was Miss
Juretha Tinsley, of Csey, and three
sons and a daughter survive the
gentleman. He was closely related
to the several families of his name
of the county and was also related by
marriage to Mr. andMrs. A. C. Car
man Lire whs -Mfey, ar.d especially
the Mt. Salem section, will miss
this excellent citizen, whose honor
able career and clean life should be
an example for all. The burial oc
cured in Buffalo cemetery Sunday
afternoon at 2:30 after comforting
words by Dr. M. D. Early. Mr. J. C.
McClary made a brief talk at the
home Sunday morning.
James H. Alcorn Dies at Lakeland.

taken to the home of K. S. Alcorn.

there by the side of his wife, who had
preceded him to the grave for a
number of years and his death did
not come as a surprise to Kis family
and friends. He is survived by two
daughters, Misses Alice and Rose Al
corn, of his city, and Dave Alcorn,
of South Dakota, and Earnest Al
corn and George Alcorn, of Illinois.
He was a half brother of Dr. Edward

of the late Judge J. W. Alcorn. He
was a farmer of the Turnersville sec
tion for years. Deceased was 59
years old and was well-known nd lik
ed in his home county of Lincoln.
His death brought to many hearts
here and elsewhere, sadness.
Cure for Cholera Morbus.
"When our little boy, seven years
old, was a baby he was cured of chol
era morbus by Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy,"
writes Mrs. Sidney Simmons, Fair
Haven, N. Y. "Since then other
members of my family have used
this valuable medicine for colic and

tion and I gladly endorse it as a
remedy of exceptional merit." Ob

There was mighty poor picking for 1

by his absence. The result in the
contest for the Democratic nomi-
nation was so decisive that we hear
no kick whatever. There are but a
few renegades among Casey Demo
crats and Harve will get the full
strength of the party in November.
Republicans seemed to take less inter
est in the primary than Democrats,
knowing that there was absolutely
no show for either of their candi
dates in the final contest, in fact '
none of them seem to regard the I
candidates of the the two aspirants j
with any degree of seriousness, but -
more as a joke than a reality. They .
have gained some notoriety however,
which perhaps was the object after
all.
Jim Coulter went to Liberty last
Wednesday to assist in canvassing
the primary returns. Jim was a warm
supporter of Charlie Montgomery in
the race but will put in some good J

of the bolting variety of Democrats I

influential.
