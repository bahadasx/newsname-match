Brotherhood Loaders Agree to Arbi­
trate Question of Double Pay For
Overtime Provided Managers Will
Concede light-Hour Work Day—
Neither Side Optimistic Over Success
•3»f+leW-PI*n to Adjust Differences.
... Washington, Aug. 16.—After the
committee of railroad managers had
another conference with President
Wilson early today ot became known
that a proposal was under considera
tion by which the railroads would ac
cept the principle of an eight-hour day
and leajre the working out of its
application to the interstate commerce
commission or somebody formed for the
purpose.
While the managers were at the
White House the brotherhood leaders
conferred among themselves. The. gen-,
eral opinion among them was that the
president was putting the burden of
averting a-strike up to the roads.
Having agreed practically to the prin
clpl of arbitration the brotherhood
left ere inclined to the view that the
cqiviroversy could be settled by the
railroads granting the baste eight-hour
day and arbitrating the demands for
tim6 and a half for overtime, or by
eliminating the double compensation
feature.
"Managers Yielding Something.
Jrhe attitude of the managers Is said
W be. one of yielding something. Sec
retary Tumulty issued the following
statement:
"The president spent an hour and a
half tills morning with the representa
tives of the railroad managements.
After the conference be said it was
impossible as yet to report on the re
sists. All that he could Hay was that

The railroads are understood to be
ready to concede the principle of the
eight-hour day providing concessions
are made by the employes.
The men take the stand that they
principally, want the eight-hour day on
condition that it shall be enforced
whenever possible.
The railroads are said to believe it
Impossible to accept the eight-hour
day unless a new working system can
be built up.
The managers took tlie position that
the eight-hour day and the collateral
issues are Inseparable and that it
would not be practicable to accept the
eight-hour day and submit other ques
tions to arbltratlon._
Men Non-Committal.
Representatives of the brotherhoods
Insist that the proposition was not a
new one. None, of the brotherhood
officials would commit himself on
what the attitude of the ^employes
would be toward such a proposal but
they did not appear optimistic over
the likelihood of it proving acceptable.
It was pointed out, however, that if
such a proposition were tendered in
concrete form they could not but refer
It to the general board, composed of
600 committee chairmen, now in New
York.
May Tie Up Roadit.
President Garretson of the conduct
era said:
fit there Is a strike, the tranaporta
tion of mails possibly would be af
fected. The government hgs a con
tract with the railroads and'not with
the men It has nothing it can en
force on us, and it is up to the rail
roads to supply the men to carry the
mails.
"Nor is there any reason to believe
that we will look with anything but
disfavor ,pn the men running these
man trains. They will be non-union
men and their acts will show that they
are not In sympathy with our fight.
"Perhaps the cry of "industrial net
cesslty' will arise If we strike—but
such a cry has been raised ^y the 'in
terests' every time when they wanted
to protect their pockets at the expense
of the people. In Prance, when the
government, by an unconstitutional
usurpation of pow er, called the striking
trainmen to the colors^and then made
them man' the rallroadsr it was the
cry of Industrial necessity' which
caused such a blot to oe put on the
name of the nation."
.Close Watoh-by Congress.
Congress is watching the situation
With Intense apprehension. While It
W believed by most members that the
situation is not hopeless and that the
president will be able to bring the men
and the roads to arbitrate or in some
way to settle their differences, it Is
realized the outlook is grave.
Thf question being asked at the
eapltof Is, what can congress do if
there Is a strike?
Opinions differ widely whether con
gress can do anything. President Wil
«on has already talked with Senator
"Kern and others at thf* capitol about It.

Decides to Make
No Speaking Tour
Washington, Aug. 15.—After a con
ference today between Pr'esldent Wil
son and the. members of the democratic
campaign committee, Vance C. McCor
mlck, chairman of the national com
mittee, announced that the president
would make no speaking tour, but prob
ably would accept invitations to speak
at different places.
The White House made public today
a letter from Charles M. Galloway, act
ing chairman of the civil service com
mission, denying assertions of the re
publican platform that the democratic
administration has created 30,000 offices
outside the civil scrvice law, which
cost $44,000,000 a year. Mr. Galloway
gave figures to show that the number
of outside offices is small.'
he did not care to be quoted but that
the country could not have compulsory
arbitration unless ready to make men
work'at the point of the bayonet.
Just before 3 o'clock the brotherhood
leaders move3 to the White House to
renew their conference with the presi
dent.

parents as a method of rendering their
children Immune to in/antile paralysis,
Many of the cases of the disease have
been treated in the Willard Parker
hospital during the present epidemic.
The theory on which Dr. Zingher and
his assistants are working Is that the
blood of the normal adult contains the
anti-bodies which neutralize the virus
of poliomyelitis on infantile paralysis.
Some physicians believe the presence
of these anti-bodies Is due to the fact
that the parents have had the disease
in an unrecognized form. It is stated
If the theory of the anti-bodies is cor

prove as effective in preventing infan

WILD ADVANCE IN WHEAT.
December Option Gains Eight Cents in
Closing Hour of Trade.
Chicago, Aug. 15.—The wheat mar
ket made another sensational advance
on crop damage reports today. De
cember options, forty minutes before
the close, had advanced an extreme 8
cents, from $1.38 to $1.46 cents a
bushel. September, less active, rose
from $1.35, where it sold early to $1.42.
Later December sold at $1.46% and
closed at $1.45%. September closed at
$1.42. The net advance with yesterday's
close was 4% cents for September and
4VB cents for December.
The advance 'began with the reitera
tions of a well known expert that the
latest reports showed that the recent
government report^ which sent prices
up 11 cents a few days ago, had not
exaggerated crop damage. On top of
this came a statement by the Manitoba
minister of'agriculture that the damage
was worse than previously estimated.
Bernard Snow, an expert, whose
name has been mentioned in connection
with a possible Investigation in the
rise in prices said:
"Today's market is a full answer to
any qtiestlon as to whether there has
been anything artificial in the action of
the grain market."

garrison at Chenohlatun, In eastern
Mongolia, aa reported from Toklo, dis

REMAINING UNITS
HELD AT HOME
Fear of Trouble 8hould Strike Be De
clared Responsible Fop Aeoall of
Order Sending 25,000 Guardsmen to
bles—To Move if Strike la Averted*
Washington, Aug. 16.—Orders for
the remaining mobilised units ot thl
national guard to proceed to the bor
der have been suspended by the war
department. No official explanation
has been made but it ia known that
the dolicacy ot the railroad strike sit
uation has been the moving considera
tion.
The suspension of the orders which
would have moved some 35,000 men to
tho border should not be taken aa an
indication that the president's negotia
tions with the railroad brotherhoods
and the railroad managers have taken
an unfavorable turn, but Is a measupe
of precaution. It was considered high
ly undesirable that all the remaining
guardsmen should be moved to the
border while there was a possibility ot
a railroad strike In which they might
be needed to preserve the peace.
It is clear that the suspension Is not
a revocation of the orders and. If Uy
railroad strike situation clears up, the
troops will be moved to the border
line.
The official explanation of the
change at the war department Is that
difficulties of transportation and equip
ment suddenly developed have made a
delay necessary.
Recommended by Funston.
A telegram from General Funston
disclosed that the general recom
mended the suspension of tha orders.
The telegram follows:
"In view of the possibility of
a
general railroad strike I desire,to call
attention of the war department to
difficulties that will follow1 in niafh
tainlng food
supplies. Th«sa border
states produce but little fod
stuffs ex
cept cattle.
"In view of the foregoing,
mend that the National Quard organi
sations about to start Cor border sta
tions be retained In their mobilisation
until such time as the general strike
£hall have been determined."
Always Short of Food.
San Antonio, Aug. IB.—Suspension
of the movement of 25,000 additional
guardsmen to the border wa» an
nounced at Fort Sam Houston today,
It being said that this action was the
result of a recommendation sent to
the war department yesterday by
Major General Funston.
General Funston's announcement
developed the fact that estimates give
the civilian population of the border
states flour for only one week ahead.
The army has little more. With rail
road transportation interrupted," the
situation might soon become acute.
Many border points, most Important
of all El Paso, where most of the 25,
000 men were destined today, had
only their meat supply from con
tiguous territory. They obtain from
far distant points flour and canned
goods. It was understood here that
none but the South Carolina guards
men had gotten under way.
CALLS GOMPERS NUISANCE.
Labor Leader Attacked in Senate by

Washington. Aug. 15. President
Samuel Gompers of the American Fed
eration of Labor was characterized as
a "public nuisance" by Senator Sher

rageous injustice than that of leaders
who live on the sweat of other peo
ple's brows." salrt Senator Sherman.
''Mr. Gompers Is a public nuisance."
Referring to the Indianapolis and Los
Angeles dynamite trials, Senator Sher
man declared the federation president
had "prostituted the cause of la'bor by
using funds of laboring men for the de
fense of these criminals."
"Mr. Gompers never apologised to
anybody," he continued, "but it was
tho most fortunate thing that ever'
happened to Mr. Gompers that ho.t
himself escaped Indictment on these'
same charges.
"I've been owing this to 'Mr. Gom
pers for some time and Fm handing It
to him now, and I'm responstble politi
cally and personally."
