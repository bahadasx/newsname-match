Achievements of Wilson
Recited by Democrats
j
About 150 citizens, mostly men,
turned out last evening to hear Milton
A. Miller of Portland and Judge Marion
T. Uuwford of La Grande speak fcr
thn ceudldacy of Woodrow Wilson.
The n'eakers wero warmly received
and drew much applause for their lau
dation of the president.
Botli addresses consisted largely of
a recltnl of the achievements of the
present administration and answers to
criticisms of administrations made by
Charles E. Hughes.
"The one big Issue in this campaign
is Woodrow Wilson," said Judge Craw
ford. "As your chairman, Mr. G roes
beck, has said, this campaign more
tban any other in years revolves
around one man, rather than around
any principle or policy. It Is a cam
paign between Woodrow Wilson and
Charles E. Hughes more than a cam
paign between tariff revision down
ward and tariff revision upward."
Both speakers charged that the
country was in a deplorable condition,

DEMAND INVESTIGATION PAY
FOR OVERTIME
Trainmen Do Not Desire Straight
Eight-Hour Day, But Want to Quit
When Through Railroads Object to
Eight-Hour Day Becoming Effective
Before a Complete Settlement Is
Effected.
United Press Service
WASHINGTON. D. C, Aug. 15. It
is learned that the railroads have
agreed to the principles of the eight
hour day, but demand further Investi
gation of pay for overtime. They say
these problems cannot be settled by
r.rbitratlon.
The railroads do not want the ei gut-hour-day
to become effective until the
entire subject of pay for services of
the trainmen Is settled. The employes
do not favor a straight eight hour day,
but cfsire to quit work when they are
through with their run.
Some of the railway men prefer a
settlement on a nine or ten hour basis.
President Wilson conferred this
J morning with the railroad owners. He
I is determined to prevent a strike, even
ir tie lias to appeal to representatives
ir. New York of the railroad brother
hoods. Following the conference this morn
ing President Wilson authorized the
following statement:
"The president spent an hour and a
half with representatives of the rail
roads. It is impossible yet to report
any results ; all that can be said Is that
the discussions were very candid an J
honest. The discussions progressed
about a practicable basis of settle
ment." The president confers with the
brotherhoods this afternoon.
Members of the federal mediation
boaid were called into the conference
at the White Houses this afternoon.
President Taft left the White Hour.e.
and that now many changes for the
better have been made through the in
fluence of President Wilson, Judge
Crawford declared that the many
pieces of legislation enacted since
Mnich, 1913, were due to the "com
pelling hand" of Woodrow Wilson. He
quoted Senator Cummins of Iowa in
substantiation of this. Mr. Miller said
he considered this legislation of more
magnitude and more important to tho
consuming and producing than that of
any administration in the history of
the United States.
"Yes, it may bo of more consequence
tban the bulk of all other legislation
since Washington's time," said Mr.
Miller.
Both speakers were loud In their
praise of President Wilson, because ho
had kept this country out of war with
Em ope and Mexico.
Mr. Miller and Judge Crawford, left
this morning for Bonanza, where they
will speak this afternoon. They Wilt
