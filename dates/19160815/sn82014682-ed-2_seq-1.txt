Marshall on Amendment , -t
:vf': By Three ta One. :
By C. 6. ALBERT.
(Sjiftl 8Ur-Bolltin Corrctpondeaee)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 4. The
last hope for prohibition in the- terri
tory of Hawaii has gone glimmering
for this year. There will be no action
by -Congress, either in the direction
cf positive restrictiona or reference
to the T)Ronl of a.n InrflrAtlon of rati;
timent The abandonment: of the
Sheppard proposition has thrown the
matter over for disposition' at thei
short session! ; y I
It Is true the various senate an
Louse bills providing for prohibition:
In Hawaii never have reached the
stage of actual consideration. The
best chance seemed to be a short cut
Instead of the longer Journey around
the iownship.' The Sheppard plan ar
ranged drastic prohibition for the dis
trict of Columbia. A brief amend
ment including Hawaii would have
been added at the proper time when
ever this bill came to the last stages.
It was pressed with great vigor by
Mr. Sheppard. x- ?.
, W ithin the last few days it seemed
almost certain that the Sheppard bill
would come to a teBt vote, being of
fered as an amendment to the district
of Columbia appropriation bill. The
opening was afforded when Vice-Presi
dent . Marshall held that another
SiFiSZSS
enheartened the advocates of temper
ance. The antia of the capital city
were so taken by storm and surprise
that they largely augmented the inter
nal revenue receipts. It waa naturally
believed that If the one amendment
(.tuck providing prohibition it would
come to a decisive vote.' And With
it Hawaii would have been dry or
Wet-. , ' ; ' '
It turned out that a vast propor
tion of senators did not agree with
the vice-president that outside amend
ments were in order. More than three
to one they voted the proposition pro
nounced In order. Senator Sheppard
immediately permitted it to become
known that no further efforts for
rrohibitio.j In Washington would be
made until Congress reassembles next
December.
; Thus endeth another legislative
chapter.

The national committeeman is
very optimistic regarding the outcome
of the presidential election. He says
that while traveling across tne conu

tunity to talk with people la all walks

would be elected!"
Breckons talked with Hughes Ja few
minutes In New York City, but the
latter said notnmg more man to as
a lew questions regarding conditions
in Hawaii and to accept the support
of the local Republican party. Wil
Ham R Willcox, chairman of the na
tional committee, was interviewed by
Breckons and R, O. Matheson, editor

WASHINGTON, D, C, Aug. 4the
immigration bill has been- laid away
in its. little airtight pigeoQhole until
next December, v It will not be attach-
as a rider- to the child labor mea
sure or any otfter, propoaltidn now
pending. It is pronounced dead for
this session or Congress;
This final disposition of & bother
some question . followed another cau
cus of . Democratic senators. , The de
claration by Senator Borah that he
would offer the immigration bill in its
entirety as an amendment to ttwnchttd
labor bill placed the Democrats ? in
a deep cavity.1 They were much dis
tressed and sought means of extrica
tion from the predicament that prom
ised much of evil and nothing of good
Hence, the caucus.
It was deter lined after a solemn
conclave to Jump in and vote down
the immigration bill when suggested
as an amendment thereby throwing
it over until next winter. A conclu
sion to that effect had ybeen. previ
ously reached, but the announcement
bv Mr. Borah " threw if all out ot
plumb.
Unless the Democrats followed the
course Indicated nothing could have
prevented the adoption of the immi
ration bill More than two-thirds of
the senators, without regard to party,
tre in favor of such legislation. It
would have been accepted in conjunc
tion with other legislation, or as a
separate measure. .
As - the - situation now stands the
immigration bill will be passed some
time during the coming short session
of Congress. AH indications are that
it will be vetoed by president Wilson,
as he did b fore, following the ex
ample of President Taft A count of
hoses has been made In both senate
and house, the result being an asser
tion that sufficient votes will be
found to make the legislative effective
despite the executive disapproval,
The political advantage-- derived
from postponement of the immigration
bill will be evenly divided between
the two big parties. Each can safe
ly declare their Interest in the alien
and make promises for future protec
tion; In addition, each can place all
blame for failure to pass the bill on
the other side.
