OCALA COULD
STAND IT
Railroad Strike Would be Rough on
Our People but They Wouldn't
be Ruined ,
V What the effect on Ocala and Mar
ion county will be in the event of a
general railroad strike, entirely tying
up train service, is difficult to, deter
mine. This county is certainly as
w ell prepared to meet the situation
as any section of the state, and prob
ably better prepared Ithan most coun
ties , to withstand the hardships of
isolation. Even should the river fail
to help matters, and should the sup
ply, of gasoline for motor cars give
out, the people of f Marion county
would , not lack . food. It would be
necessary to economize, many luxur
ies would have to be done away with,
higher prices would obtain, but the"
rich Jands of this county would supply-
meats, vegetables and staples,
and the waters would supply fish
without end. The county's bumper
corn crop would provide ah abundance
of grits and meal, the meal making
an excellent substitute for flour. The
sweet potato crop would supply the
county for months.. The cowpea crop
is not to be overlooked. Peanuts, of
which there are thousands of acres,
would provide a substitute for butter.
The peanut butter factories are in the
county, and could r , work ' overtime..
Sugar cane would provide-the bounty
with "long sweetening" "for a long
period with proper conservation." ;
. On the other hand ' many 'persons
would be thrown out of ,.-'work,v busi
ness would be compelled to close,
some ; would probably be . forced en
tirely out of business, construction
work would ;cease for lack of mater
ials and left unfinished ; would deter
iorate, manufacturies forced to shut
down for lack of fuel, material or a
market, would suffer from' deprecia
tion. .. -" . ' .. '
JHome talent would have to be de
pended on for amusement. Both
Ocal and Marion have ..plenty of good
talent. The public utilities of the
city and .county Would not suffer to
any great extent, because of the use
of wood-for fuel and because of the
waterpower.,-The County is well sup
