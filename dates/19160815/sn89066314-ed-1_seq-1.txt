2,500 ROOKIES TO SEA
ON NAVALPLATTSBURG
Uncle Sam Sends Private Ci
tizens on Prepared
ness Trip.
EIGHT SHIPS ARE USED
Everyone From Day Labor
er to the Millionaire Is
on the Voyage.
11 I lilted Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. Two
thousand five hundred potential sail
ors erstwhile private citizens of the
United States, whoso naval experience
heretofore has been nil started out
from eastern seaports today for a
four-weeks' cruise in the interest of
naval preparedness a sort of Naval
Plattsburg personally conducted by
the Navy Department.
The cruise Is the first of its sort
for civilians who want to learn navy
ways. The men will do just what the
Annapolis men do on their cruises:
learn how to work a ship and fire
guns; and, incidentally, how to keep
the brasswork shiny.
Many of the sailors arc university
men; others are mechanics, radio and
telegraph operators; men with and
without sea experience. They range in
years from a boasted 19 to an admitt
ed 43. and in wealth from $1 a week
to $4 a minute.
As planned by the Navy, the cruise
will provide a naval reserve apart
from the naval militia that will be
available in time of war.
Here are the eight ships doing the
work of carrying the recruits:
The Kiarsarge, sailing from Port
land, Me., with about SO recruits; the
Virginia from Boston with about 4C3
and from Newport with about 28; the
Jutinc and Kentucky from New York
with i.bout 943; the Rhode Island
from Philadelphia with about 379; the
Illinois from Norfolk with about 461
and the Alabam from Charleston with
about 101 men.
The recruits' day u ill start at just
about the time some of them have
been starting for the all-night athletic
clubs for a combination late supper
and early breakfast 4 a. m. It ends
at 9:03 p. m. It includes everything
from holystoning a deck to learning
what makes a turret turn, and why.
It won't be all work and no play,
though. Plans include regattas, base
ball games between ship teams and
swimming contests. All the 2,500 will
have a chance to get a breath of salt
air and a set of sea legs. Many of
them, it is expected, will join naval
militia organizations after their first
experience with battleships. They will
be a3ked when the cruise is over
whether they will volunteer if the
United States has war within the next
four years.
An important feature of the cruise
will be a demonstration along the
Atlantic Coast during the last days
of the cruise, of the efficacy of mo
tor boats for home defense against
submarines. Such of the 2,500 as own
motor boats along the Atlantic coast
will bring them out and learn how
to sneak up behind a submarine and
bash up its periscope. Navy subma
rines will be buffers for the motorboat
men. They will spend part of the
time as the attackers and part of the
time as the prey of the "wasp fleet."
The Navy Department has high
hopes for the cruise. It expects it
to result in a real naval reserve that
will be ready at call to repel inva
sion. There will be a lot of fun in
it; but there will be many calloused
hands, too.

8-HOUR DAY 13 0 K
WITH R.FUIANAGERS
Employers Agree to Basic
Principle, But Demand
More Investigation.
CONFER WITH WILSON
President Says More Discus
sion Is Necessary to
Settle Matter.
By ROBERT J. BENDER
(United l'ress Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. The bur
den of confession in bringing about
an adjustment of the threatened rail
way strike appears to have swung
around from the railroads to the em
ployes today.
After the railroad managers had
been in the White House for more
than an hour and a half, it was learn
ed that they had agreed to accept the
basic principle of the 8-hour day, but
they have demanded that the ques
tion of over-time be subjected to more
far-reaching investigation.
At the conclusion of the conference
with the managers, President Wilson
authorized the following statement:
"The President spent an hour and a
half this morning with the repre
sentatives of the railroad managers.
After the conference he said it was
impossible yet to report as to the re
sult. All that he could say was that
a far-reaching and honest discussion
was in progress about the practicable
basis of settlement.'
Their acceptance of the basic prin
ciple of the 8-hour day is made con
tingent upon agreement by the em
ployes to further and more far-reaching
discussion, which would include
the question of over-time pay.
"We accept the principle of the 8
hour day," said one railroad man who
attended the conference. "However,
the S-hour day is so obviously and
naturally a part of the over-time
question that the two will have to be
handled as one problem."
The conference of the managers
ended at 10:40 o'clock this morning.
They would make no comment upon
leaving. It was announced President
Wilson would see the employes at 3
o'clock this afternoon.
The investigation of the application
of the shorter-day principle to rail
way operations, as presented to the
President today, would be made
through a board appointed by Wilson,
it is understood.
In accepting the basic principle of
the S-hour schedule the railroads go
on the belief that neither the Presi
dent nor the employes would expect
the 8-hour day to be put into effect
until the whole subject has been in
quired into and a new working pro
gram firmly constructed.
hi some respects it might be re
garded as one step forward in the
negotiations. The employes are not
favorable to an out-and-out 8-hour
day, their work to end at the con
clusion of that period.
The question of whether they would
yield on the point of delaying actual
application of the new program until
it had been subjected to thorough in
vestigation remains to be seen.
The railroads countered with the
suggestion outlined, after working
most of the night. At times, it is
said, there was strong feeling among
some of the managers that the Presi
dent had attempted to place the bur
den of confession upon them.
The President, it is understood, told
them in conference yesterday that the
8-hour principle was the one upon
which they should organize their work
and asked that they attempt to formu
late the ground-work of their settle
ment upon that point.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 15. The ex
ecutive board of the big four broth
erhoods of railroad employes went to

ternoon to receive personally from

Sent this morning. j
A. II. Garretson. spokesman for the ,
employes, smiled a little when told of
the managers" proposal, but refused
to discuss whether or not it was sat
isfactory to the men.
"I have given my pledge of silence
to the President, and, therefore, can
not directly or indiractly say whether
the proposals are acceptable," he said.
"As long as the matter is in the hands
of the President I shall follow this
rule."

MILITIA WONT MOVE
Threatened Strike CausesCan-
celing of Order to Go
the Border.
ISy United Press.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15. Because
of the threatened railroad strike the
War Department suspended indef
initely the proposed movement to the
border of approximately 33,000 mobil
'ii ill llllllir.T in state camps, last week
ordered to the Mexican line.
The reason for suspending the
movement is shortage of supplies and
difficulty of obtaining transportation
for the men. It has no connection,
it was said, with the possible use of
state troops during the threatened
railroad strike.
Until further orders are Issued,
none of the organizations which are
preparing to leave state camps will
be sent to the border.
HALL THEATER TO (JIVE BENEFIT
Plans Are for Commercial Club 1 As.
sist at Opening September 1.
The new Hall Theater will be
onened about September 1, but
whether it will be a benefit perform
ance or not will be decided by the
Commercial Club at its weekly ban
quet on Thursday at Harris.
"Last fall the Commercial Club
voted to make the first performance
in the Hall Theater a benefit show,'
said Frank Conley, who has charge
of the plans, this morning. "I am
very much in favor of it, for a build
ing of this kind is a great help to
the town. The movement is entire
ly voluntary on the part of the club,
and is merely a means of showing the
ippreciation of the citizens of the
town for the new theater. If we arc
successful with our plans, the tickets
will be sold by the members of the
Commercial Club, who will try to
make the opening a big one."
The plans have never been brought
before the members of the club this
year, and nothing is settled as yet.
"We Intend to open the theater
about September 1," said Manager
Woods this morning. "The scenery
should arrive today, and the complet
ing touches put on in a few days. The
orchestra will begin rehearsal in a
few days. I hope to have the theater
in good running order by September
15, when the students will begin to
arrive. I am not sure what the open
ing performance will be, and do not
know whether we will open with
vaudeville or pictures. I know- noth
ing of the proposed benefit."

J. E. BOGGS IS PLACED
ONSTATECOMMITTEE
Columbian and Dr. L. M.
Gray Are Elected at Boon-
ville Today.
WINS ON 15TH BALLOT
Meeting Was Deadlocked at
First, But McClung
Forces Finally Lost.
Ily Special Correspondence.
BOONVILLE, Aug. 15. James E.
Boggs of Columbia and Dr. L. M. Gray
of California, Mo., were elected State
Committeemen at the meeting held this
afternoon in Boonville. Bc-gg's elec
tion came on the fifteenth ballot. Gray
was elected a few minutes later.
The meeting was called to order at
2 o'clock by .Mr. Hicko of California.
Speed Mosby, state beer inspector, was
elected chairman. This seemed to
point to a victor- for McClung, as
Mosby was known to be one of Mc
Clung's 'chief supporters. The vot
ing was a deadlock at first, but shortly
before train time the deciding ballot
was cast in favor of Mr. Boggs. When
Hoggs was elected the McClung forc
es broke and Doctor Gray was easily
nominated. The meeting broke up
about 4 o'clock.
James E. Boggs
has lived in Colum
bia most of his life.
He was born in
Boone county in 18S0.
When a boy he moved
to Columbia, and re
ceived a high school
education. He stud
led law in local of
fices and was ad
mitted to the bar No
vember 1S99. For
several years Mr.
Boggs was Justice of the Peace, and
in this capacity decided the case of
the Columbia and Cedar Turnpike
Company vs. I. C. Vivion. His decis
ion was reversed by the Circuit Court,
but this decision was again reversed
by the Court of Appeals and the dicis
ion made by Mr. Boggs stood.
For three years Boggs was Deputy
Circuit Clerk. He was then elected
Circuit Clerk and has held this posi
tion for ten years.
Mr. Boggs edited the "Missouri Jus
tice" for years, a monthly paper with
a large circulation. He was president
of the Circuit Clerk and Recorder's
Association of Missouri. To Mr. Baggs
is due the credit for the success of the
Jefferson Banquet, held in Columbia
April 13, 1915. He is a member of
tho Elk lodge.
He was campaign manager for At
torney General Barker in this county
in 1912, and the vote his candidate re
ceived speaks for the work that Mr.
Boggs did in this campaign. This
year he again supported Mr. Barker
in this county, and Boone county gave
the third largest vote of any county
in the state for Barker.
