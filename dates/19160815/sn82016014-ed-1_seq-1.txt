RAILROAD HEADS
READY TO GRANT
EIGHTHOUR DAY
Concede Point in Conference
With President Wilson.
But Employers Want Arbitra
tion on Overtime Demand.
UNIONS FAR FR0M SATISFIED
Already Knew They'd Give Us
That, Says Delegate.
Brotherhood Leaders Say Strike
Attitude Is Unchanged.
Washington, Aug. 15. The burden
or concessions in bringing about an
adjustment of the threatened railroad
strike appeared to have swung around
from the railroads to the employes to
ll a j'.
After the railroad managers had
been in the White House for more
than an hour and a half, it was learn
ed that thev have agreed to accept the
basic principle of the eight hour day
but they demand that the question of
overtime pay be subjected to a more
lar-reaching investigation.
Their aceptance of the basic prin
ciples of the eight hour day is made
contingent upon agreement by the
employes to further and more far
reaching discussion which would in
clude the question of overtime pay.
Accept 8-Hour Day Principle.
4-cnrrtinir to one of the railroad
managers who attended the conference
the following is their position:
We accept the principle of the
eight-hour day. However, the eight-
hour day question is so oDviousiy anti
naturally a part of the overtime ques
tion, that the two will have to be
handled as one problem."
The conference of the managers
ended at 10:41). The would make no
comment upon leaving. It was an
nounced the president would see the
employes at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The investigation of the application
of the shorter day principle to railway
operation as presented to the presi
dent today would be made thru a
board appointed by the president, it is
understood. In accepting the basic
principle of the eight hour day. the
roads go on the belief that i.either the
lresidenc nor the employers would ex
pect the eight hour day to be put
into effect until the whole subject hs
been inquired into and a working pro
gram finally constructed.
Complications Arise.
In some respects it might be re
garded as a step forward in the nego
tiations. The employes are not fa
vorable to an out and out eight hour
clay, their work to end at the conclu
sion of that period. The question of
whether they would yield on the point
of delaying actual application of the
new program until it has been sub
jected to thoro investigation remains
to be seen.
The roads countered with the sug
gestion outlined after working most of
tne night. At times, it is said, there
was strong feeling among some cf the
managers that the president had at
tempted to place the burden of con
cession upon them. He had, it is un
derstood, told them in conference yes
terdny that the eight hour principle
was the one upon which they should
try to work, and suggested they at
tempt to formulate the groundwork
of a settlement on that basis.
Brotherhoods Not Pleased.
A. B. Garretson. spokesman for
tne employes, smiled a little when told
of the managers' proposal, but refused
to discuss whether or not it was sat
isfactory to the men.
"I have given the pledge of silence
to the president and therefore cannot
say directly or indirectly whether the
propositions are acceptable." he said.
"As long as the matter is in the hands
of the president I shall follow this
rule."
AAnother representative of the em
ployes was sarcastic regarding the
managers' proposals.
"That will be very nice," he said,
'but there is nothing new about that
idea. I have known about that for a
week. They were talking that propo
sition before we ever came down
here."
Garretson and his associates appear
ed to take the managers' idea lightly
The men eay there is no reason to
change their attitude thus far.
Puts It l to Kuilroads.
While the managers were -it the
Ah;le House the brotherhood leute-s
conferred among themselves and
awaited the call for their conference
A. Re"f'ral opinion among thm was
that the president was putting the
iirci-n of averting a strike up to the
imlroads and that the prospects for a
set.lprrcnt were good.
Having agreed practically to 'the
principle of arbitration the brother
hood leaders incline to the view that
the controversy could be settled bv the
railroads granting the basic eight hour
day and arbitrating the demands for
time and a half for overtime; or by
eliminating the double compensation
leature and having the railroads
make a flat agreement to put in the
eight hour day. The attitude of the
managers as thev went to the White
House was said to be one of yielding
something. They had spent most of
the night deciding whether they
should eliminate all their contingent
proposals or some of them.
t.uuril Conference News.
Secretary Tumulty issued the fol
lowing statement:
"The president spent an hour and a
half this morning with the represen
tatives of the railwav management.
After the conference he said it was
impossible as yet to report on the re
sults. All that he could say was that
a very candid and honest discussion
was in progress about practicable
bases of settlement."

DYER'S FRIENDS

Supreme Court Takes Up Guy.
er-LIttle Case.
Fred W. Knapp's certificate of nom
ination for state auditor is to be held
up pending supplemental returns from
Cloud county which showed an error
in favor of Dan B. Dyer. In the mean
time Dyer's friends are looking for
other errors in the primary count.
Possibilities of a contest were ad
mitted today by Senator I. M. Mahin
of Smith Center, attorney for Dyer,
although he expressed the belief that
sufficient errors might not be found
to overcome Knapp's lead.
Supplemental returns in the auditor
fight may be asked from other coun
ties, according to rumors today in the
state house. It is reported that errors
favorable to Dyer have been found in
several counties and that pending re
turns from Cloud county sufficient
mistakes may be recorded to change
results. The Cloud county error takes
ten votes from Knapp.
"I doubt if contest proceedings will
be filed unless there are further mis
takes found." said Senator Mahin. "Of
course we are looking for anything
favorable to Dyer and if other changes
are made, we may go farther in the
matter."
It was reported today that returns
from nearly forty counties are being
checked by Dyer s friends.
Take Up Guyer Suit.
This afternoon the supreme court
took up the suits filed by U. S. Guyer
in his contest for the Republican
congressional nomination in the Sec
ond district. E. C. Ldttle holds a lead
of one vote over Guyer on the face
of the returns. Pending action of the
supreme court the state canvassing
board suspended final action on. re
turns until late this afternoon.

OIL AT JUENEMO
Quantity Discovered at Depth
of 1,800 Feet.
Drilling at Oyerbrook Is Well
Under Way.
Oil has been discovered in the sand
of the Quenemo well at a depth of
1,800 feet, according to an snnounce
ment made today by O. P. Boggs. the
Oklahoma oil man directing the drill
ing at the Overbrook and Quenemo
oil wells. While this is not a definite
sign v.hat oil in paying quantities ex
ists it is one of the most favorable
indications that can be discovered by
drillers, Mr. Bdggs says.
The drillers are still several hun
dred feet from the Mississippi lime
and it will take a week, or more, until
that point Is reached. Meantime, the
drilling at Quenemo is becoming a
very intensive bit of work.
'Drilling at Overbrook Is really un

BIG TRADE 'GUNS'
U. S. Needs Them to Compete

Urges Passing of Webb Law to

Chicago, Aug. 15. At the close of
the present European war the Lnited
States "Must have the same size guns
for competing in foreign markets that
our battleships are now equipped
with," according to E. N. Hurley,
chairman of the federal trade commis
sion in a published statement here to
day. He declared that while congress
has passed many bills which wih be
helpful to business after the world
war is over they will be for naught
unless the Webb bill, now pending,
also is passed.

allowed their manufacturers and mer
chants to combine, forming cartels
and syndicates to compete in the mar
kets of the world not only combining
in their respective industries in the
different countries but nations are
now combining to protect their inter
ests. Commercial War at Hand.
"With these conditions existing and
this great commercial war at hand our
preparedness must be on the lines of
preparing not only for battle, but for
commercial warfare. Our manufac
turers and merchants must have the
same size guns as our foreign rivals
possess.
"If the Webb bill is not passed and
some immediate relief given to manu
facturers and merchants of this coun
try, nothing can prevent our :'.creign
competitors from getting more than
their share of the foreign business. It
is not a question of clarifying the
Sherman law; it is not a question of
changing this law so that it will af
fect our business in any way, or allow

question of creating markets for our
surplus products which means that ev

country will be materially benefited.
"Congress has passed many bills
helpful to business. They will all be
for naught unless the Webb bill is

Petrograd, Aug. IB. The new Aug-;

river to which General Bothmer re
treated from the river Strlpa, Is giving
way under heavy Russian pressure.
Russian forces have crossed the ZIota
Lipa In the north and are attacking
Botnmer's army. The Austro-Ger-
mans are making desperate efforts to
throw the czar's troops back to the
east bank. In the south the Russians
approaching Halitz are several miles
west of the ZIota Lipa and seriously,
threaten Bothmer's right flank and
rear.
Unless the Russian advance Is
speedily checked the Austro-Germans
must continue their retreat until they
reach the Gnista Lipa river, a retire
ment of nearly 85 miles on a ; wide
front.
Give Up Carpathian Campaign. ' "-'
The Austrians have almost entirely
ceased their attacks In the extreme
southeast, near the Carpathians, ac
cording to advices from the front to
day. Ten days .ago the arrival of
strong bodies of Austrian and German
reinforcements was followed by heavy
attacks that caused the Russian line
to retire slightly. It is now, believed
that these reinforcements have been
withdrawn and are being hurried to
the defense of Lemberg, by a round
about railroad route south of the Car-,
pathians.
The Russians are now drawing in;
upon Lemburg on a curving 160 mile
front. At the nearest point, south
west of Brody, they are about forty
five miles trim the Gallclan capital.
Paris, Aug. IB. A French grenade

Fine chapel, at the intersection of
the Fleury and Vaux roads.
Germans Win Salient, Driven Out.
German counter-attacks in this re

CHINO-JAP TROUBLE
International Complication May Arise
Over Killing Jap Soldiers.
London, Aug. 15. Possibilities of
complications in the far east were seen
here today in reports of a clash be
tween Chinese and Japanese troops at
Chengchlatun, northeast of Peking.
Tcklo dispatches asserted that the
Chinese were the aggressors attacking
the Japanese garrison and later be
sieging the Japanese in the Cheng
chiatun fort.
Or.e officer and seventeen Japanese
soldiers were reported to have been
killed.
Japan Sends Soldiers.
Japanese reinforcements are en
route to the relief of the garrison.
This is the first report reaching
London on many months of fighting
between armed forces of the two na
tions and the first disturbance of its
kind in northern China, where the
Japanese recently sent more troops.
Chinese and Japanese police clashed
in Amoy, southern China, several
weeks ago. As a, result the Japanese
government made formal request upon
China for protection of Japanese
within the borders of the republic.

The train service brotherhood strike
crisis in Topeka railway circles as
sumed a more serious aspect today
when It became known that officials
and employes of the railroads here ar
notifying their families who are in va
cation resorts to come home. The
report of this development is made by
a Topeka woman who returned from
Colorado Monday.
"The train," she said, "was crowd
ed. I saw several Topeka women and
men who said they were returning
from ' their vacation trips. I knew
these people do not usually return un
til a month later than this.
'Several women, wives of Topeka
officials and employes, told me they
had received telegrams from their
husbands telling them that the crisis
which the strike had reached demand
ed that they come home at once.
They said the messages were sent to
them in code to the station agent and
he in turn read them over the tele
phone. None of the women saw any
of the messages."
Fear of a possible strike has been
hurting the passenger business of sev
eral western roads, it is reported. At
that, however, traffic has been un
usually heavy this year to Colorado
and other western summer resorts-

national Woman's party, which held a
three-day conference here last week,
that the Nevada Women's Civic
league,, of which she is president, had
severed its relations with the Naticlial
American Woman Suffrage associa
tion. One reason given for the with
drawal was the desire to work exclu
sively for the Susan B. Anthony
amendment.
Suffrage leaders declared that the
state-by-state method pursued by the
national association was regarded as
futile, as more than twenty state con
stitutions are impossible of amend
ment. Wage Fight in Nevada.
It was asserted that the Nevada or
ganization favored a campaign against
the party responsible for failure to

frage and the Woman's party, which
leaders assert are opposed to Mrs. Car.

"Women Only" Audience
Cheers Candidate Wildly.
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 16. Governor
Hughes is putting the personal punch
into his speeches in Washington state.
He began today to use the personal
pronoun in pledges and promises.
"If you elect me to an executive of
fice," he told an audience here today,
"I propose to use my full executive
influence."
This was the first time that the
Republican nominee has used the inti
mate personal pioroun. It was in
dicative of a further step in the gov
ernor's "warming up" process.
In his speeches across the continent
so far the G. O. P. aspirant for pres

fined himself to speaking nf the party.
The only personal references were
veiled.
Uses Only One Speech.
The governor has really only one
speech. It starts off with a plea for
unity of Americanism, touches on pre
paredness, attacks Democratic policies
on both matters; swings to the Mexi
can problem, jumps back to an attack
on the Democrats for governmental
inefficiency, "pork" methods, and lack
of co-ordination and ends with a
pledge of "better government" under
Republican rule. Roosevelt usually
had six different speeches in his cam
paigning and Taft at least four. Both
altered these stock speeches to em
phasize some different section. Hughes
localizes his.
Today Hughes chose inefficiency as
his main battering ram in the assault
against the Democratic citadel. But
what was remarked most by those
who have been associated with him
since the start of his campaign trip
was the extraordinary.."polish" which
the nominee has now applied to this
one speech. It was a perfect indication
that the governor has now reached the
summit of his campaigning skill. He
put in new synonyms, new similies,
new epigrams and consequently he got
as big a reception here as anywhere
on the trip

In addition to his Tacoma speech

inevitable and pledged his full sup
port to the federal woman suffrage
