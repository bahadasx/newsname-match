In Case of Strike Soldiers

San Antenfo. Texas. A tier. 15,
The order for tin- remainder of
the country militia, about !25.0o
men. t proceed to the border, has
been revoked, according to an.
nonneemcnt malo at southern de
partment he;idq starters today. The
var department notified headquar
ters here that troops would con
liii n to bo held in their state
mobilization Kimps.
Washington, Aug. 15. Orders for
the remaining mobilized units of the
rational guard to proceed to the bor
der have been suspended by the war
department. No official explanation
has been made but it is known that
tjie delicacy of the railroad strike sit
uation has boon the moving considera
tion. Suspension of the orders which
ould have moved some
.000 men to
the border, should not !- taken as an
indication that the president's negotia
tions with the railroad brotherhoods
and the railroad managers have taken
an unfavorable turn but is a measure
of caution. It was considered highly
undesirahle that all remaining guards
men should be moved to the lorder
whiie there was a possibility that they
ffiipht be called upon to preserve
order throughout some of the states.
There is even the possibility that some
cf the troops in the event of a strike
Eight be cai:ed upon to guard or oper
ate mail trains and trains supplying
troops along th-'- border. The suspen
sion of the orders prevents the immed
iate movement of the troops from Ken
tucky, Ohio and Vermont and the
movement of ail other mobilized units
which were to have gone forward as
sooa as they were equipped.
To Go When Strike Crisis Iassos.
It is clear that if the railroad strike
situation clears up the troops will be
Cloved to the border line.
The
f hansre
ofli
ial explanation of
the
at th
war department is that
d;fiicaiti-s .it transportation and equip
tnent suddenly developed have made a
d'day necessary. It is known, how
ever, that the railway situation is the
real cause.

recommended the suspension of the

her crow were drowned, says a Turin
dispatch to the Petit JanrnaL The
date of the disaster is given only as a
day in August.
Tho fire, says the dispatch, was dis
covered in the dreadnought's kitchen
and spread rapidly. The captain im
mediately ordered the magazines
flooded and tried to beach the battle

this could b done. The vessel was
turned over on her side and a large
number of the crew were thrown into
the sea.
It is belieevd that the battleship can
be righted and refloated.

Giulio Cesare and was launched in
October, 1911. Her displacement was
22.000 tons and she was 57514 feet long,

on Illinois'1
ISfeivPrison
Joliet, 111., Aug. 15. Work is under
way today on the construction of the
new $3,500,000 Illinois penitentiary',
which is expected to be completed
within five years. The work is being
done entirely by convict labor.
The site for the prisoa is 2,193 acres,
four miles from tiie present peniten
tiary and northwest of Joliet. The
plans are declared to be the last word
in prison architecture. Eight circular
cell houses, each with a roof of glass,
are to be built around a central dining
hall, with which each will bo con
nected by a corridor.
Kach cell house is to be 150 feet in
diameter and to accommodate 250 pris
oners. Every cell is to be an "outside"
cell and its window will open on the
walled-in prison yard. Its inner front
will be glassed in, making each cell
room.
Sunshine will reach every cell, al
though the windows will have steel
bars on the inside of the glass en
casement and on the outside also, thus
making escape practically imjossible.
An elaborate ventilating system will
be installed and the air passing
through the cells will be washed and
heated.

REAL GHOSTS I
DEMOCRATS HOPE
TO WIN IN STATE
Aauonal and Local Forces Join In
Fig-ht to Put Illinois In the
Wilson Column.
Chicago, Aug. 15. President Wil
son's campaign managers have a
strongly intrenched hope that Illinois
will go democratic in November.
They have listed the state as abso
lutely doubtful and are making prep
arations for a campaign that will be
anything but perfunctory.
Senator Thomas J. Walsh, western
! democratic manager, has formed an
alliance with the democratic state
committee, and from the national and
state headquarters yesterday word
went out that full cooperation is to
prevail.
The return of Roger C. Sullivan
from the east, bringing reports that
the situation is highly favorable to
the reelection of President Wilson,
prefaced news that all differences that
have arisen during four years have
been subdued for the present.
Senator Walsh advised National
Committeeman Charles Boeschenstein
and State Chairman Arthur W. Charles
that he will arrive from Washington
Thursday prepared to inaugurate a
hard fight in Illinois.
Chairman Charles immediately sent
out telegraphic requests to all county
chairmen and the secretaries asking
them to report at state headquarters
in Hotel Sherman Thursday morning.
Senator Walsh is to present to them
a plan of campaign he expects to have
ratified and inaugurated without de
lay. It is understood there is to be fi
nance in sufficiency to go through with
elaborate plans that are to be approv
ed formally at the White house tomor
row at a conference in which National
Chairman Vance McCormick, Senator
Walsh and other democratic mana
gers will sit in with President Wilson.
Mr. Boeschenstein received direc
tions from National Treasurer Wilbur
W. Marsh to proceed with the installa
tion of furniture at the Karpen build
ing headquarters. These are to be
opened Thursday.

Chicago, Aug. 15. The bread situa
tion as it effects makers and the pub
lic was to be the subject of a confer
ence between E. A. Hurley of the fed

States District Attorney dyne today.
It was said the wheat situation would
come up for discussion.
The possibility that Federal Judge
Landis might be asked by Mr. Clyne to
summon a special grand jury to in
vestigate what is alleged to have been
the recent manipulation of the wheat
market by speculators, was reported
but could not be confirmed early today.

RAILROAD CHIEFS CONSIDER
PLAN TO AGREE TO DEMAND
OF WORKERS; ARE DOUBTFUL
TO FIGHT PLAGUE
WITH GOOD BLOOD
To Experiment in Xew York by Taking
Fluid F'rom Veins of Parents to
Battle Disease.
New York, Aug. 15. Family physi
cians were advised today by Dt. Abra
ham Zingher of Willard-rarker hos
pital, to try the use of "normal" blood
serum obtained from parents as a
method of rendering their children im
mune to infantile paralysis.
The tiVeory on which Dr. Zingher
and his assistants are working is that
the blood of the normal adult contains
the anti-bodies which neutralize the
virus of poliomyelitis, or infantile par
alysis. Some physicians believe the
presence of these anti-bodies is due to
the fact that the parents have had the
disease in an unrecognized form. It
is stated that if the theory of the anti
bodies is correct, the blood serum
treatment may prove as effective in
preventing infantile paralysis as vac
cination is in preventing typhoid.
GOVERNOR DUNNE

Texas, Aug. 15. Governor Edward F.
Dunne of Illinois and his staff today

Governor Dunne Intends to remain
here two days, following which, at the
invitation of Brigadier General Park
er, U. S. A., he will inspect the First
Illinois cavalry at Brownsville, Texas.
Governor Dunne was enthusiastic
over the condition of the state troops.
"I find the boys in good health, well
contented with their army life, and as
good a body of soldiers as can bo found
anywhere," he said.

AGAIN GROWS GRAVE
Employes in Conference See
Little Hope for New
Proposal Made.
Washington, Anc l.. After the
committee of railroad managers
had another conference with Pres.
ident Wilson early today, it be
came known that a proposal was
unded consideration by which the
railroads would accept the prin
ciple of an clirht-hour day and
leave the working out of its ap
plication to the interstate com
merce commission or some body
formed for the purpose.
Secretary Tumulty issued the fol
lowing statement:
"The president spent an hour and a
half this morning with the represen
tatives of the railway management.
After the conference ho said that it
was impossible as yet to report on the
results; all that he could say was that
a very candid and honest discussion
was in progress about practicable
basi3 of settlement."
Iloth Keady to Concede Toints,
Whether this plan can be worked out
will not be known until President
Wilson presents it to the brotherhood
leaders.
The railroads are understood to be.
ready to concede the principle of the
8-hour day, providing concessions be
made by the employes so too heavy a
burden will not be placed upon the
railroads.
The men say they principally want
the 8-hour day on conditions that it
shall be enforced whenever possible.
The railroads are said to believe it im
possible to accept the 8-hour day un
less a workable system of application
can be built up. Members of the man
agers' committee said they had no
plans for the future and did not know
whether they would be called to the
White house again.
Must Be Decided Tog-ether.
The managers say the 8-bour day
and the collateral Issues are insepar
able and that it would not be prac
ticable to accept the 8-hour day and
submit the other question to arbitra
tion. All of the issues are inter
woven, they contend, and must be de
cided together.
Representatives of the brotherhoods
heard of the proposal with interest
but insisted the proposition was not a
new one.
None of the brotherhood officlats
would commit himself on what the
attitude of the employes would be to
ward such a proposal but they did not
appear optimistic over the likelihood
of it proving acceptable.
Would Go to Board.
The employes' representatives said
If such a proposition were tendered In
concrete form to them they could only
refer it to the general board, composed
of 600 committee chairman now In
New York.
It was probable, one of the officials
said, that if such a proposition were
submitted to them through the presi
dent today they would return to New
York and place it before tho general
board.
3Ien Pessimistic.
As the heads of tho railroad brother
hoods assembled at the White house
at 3 o'coek this afternoon for their
second conference with President Wil
son there were expressions of doubt
among officials close to the situation
over whether tho men would accept
the proposal of the railroads made to.
the president earlier in the day by the
managers' committee.
In effect the railroads proposed, It
was understood, to grant tho basic
eight-hour day and leave the question
of its application to be decides! by
some commission.
The heads of the brotherhoods said
before going to the president's confer
ence that they themselves could not
pass upon such a proposition but would
have to refer It back to the general
committee of union heads in New
York. As they entered the president's
room, however, the union leaders gave
outward evidence of pesRlmlsm.
Situation More Grave.
"Lot us pray." was th cryptic, re
sponse of A. B. Garretson. head of the
conductors, when asked what he
thought of the outcome.
"I hope to the Ixird, this conference
will be favorable," jald Lee of tho
conductors.
It was apparent that the feeling of
optimism which prevailed when yes
terday's conferences chitted had mys
teriously been dissipated today and
that all recognized the situation as
more grave.
