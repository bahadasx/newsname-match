FOURTEENTH YEAR ji
WILSON WILL ( I
TRY TO AVERT I
BIGJTRIKE 1 1
Asks For Conference With Railroad J 1

'111
New York Aug. 13. A general ifBl
strike on nearly nil of tho railroads ' III
cf the nation, paralyzing commerce !$ll
and throwing approximately 2,000,000 111
men out of employment, can bo avert- Hi
ed only through the good offices of HI
President Wilson as a result of to- MM
day's developments In tho dispute II
over tho men's demands for an eight SLV
hour day and time and a half for HI
overtime. HI
Tho controversy was laid before tho HI
President , at his Invitation, after tho HI
workers had flatly rejected any form HI
of arbitration. They refused media- 9
tlon yesterday. 'iHl
Soon after accepting the President's Hi
summons, extended through the fed- I HI
eral board of mediation and concilia- HI
tlon, the men announced that tho lead 'Hi
ers of tho four railroad botherhoods 'Hi
would leave for Washington nt mid- H I
night, accompanied by thirty of tho HI
COO delegates nisembled here. 'HI
An hour later tho railroad managers I HI
nineteen In number, said that titer H
would leave for the capital at the rfll
same time, Hi I
Both parties will reach Washington -HI
tomorrow In time for an early confer- IHJ1
ence with the President. Tho hour HI
for the meeting will bo arrangod by 11 1
Secretary Tumulty, who started forj IHl
1 ttls city from Washington lato today LfVI
'as Mr. Wilson's representative arrlv-
lug horo at 9 q'clock tonight. Kill
I Mr. Tumulty brought with hlra a I MM
communication from President Wilson . HI
addressed o tho brotherhoods and tho 'HI
ralroad managers pointing out that H I
such n paralysis of business as would ' : Hi
follow a general railroad strike wouto .Hi
bo a catastrophe at any time, but , WM
would be nothing short of a disaster Bj
under present conditions. On this 'HI
ground tho President based his re- HI
quest for a conference with represent , 'Hi
atlves of both factions. II
Negotiations Broken Off 'HI
Negotiations had not been broken 1 Ih1
oft when Mr. Tumulty left Washing- HI
ton, but when lie reached Phlladel- Mil
phla he received a telegram from W. Ml
L. Chambers, one of the mediators, In- iffill
forming him the men had declined to 111
arbitrate. Mr. Tumulty's first stop fill
after reaching New York was to call vll
President Wilson on the long distance I flfcl
telephone to decide upon an hour for 'jHJ
tho fateful conference at the Whlto Hfl
Houso tomorrow. jHJ
The final break camo lato today at- HH
ter the men had been In secret session HJ
nearly six hours. Reports 'differ as HH
to tho reason tor the failuro of tlio HH
negotiations in view of the cheerful HH
outlook of the night boforo. Tho men HH
assert they refused arbitration be- jH
cause tho railroads Insisted on arblt- HH
rating their contingent proposition. 'HH
The board of mediators in a statemet ;HH
Issued tonight declared however, tho
,inen rejected their proposition, con- HH
'lending that they would not arbitrate
even If tho railroads, waived tho con-
tlngent proposition. The statement ?HH
of the mediators, issued by Judge HH
Martin A. Knapp, chairman of the
board, Just boforo their departuro for HH
Washington, follows. :HH
"After repeated efforts to bring
about an arbitration of tho pending
controversy between tho railroads HJ
and their employees in train and yard HH
sorvlce, the United States board of .
mediation and conciliation was today
advised by tho representatives of tho
employees that they would not submit Mm
the matters In dlsputo to arbitration jHB
In any form. iHH
and sweet fragrance, also upholds ;
and sustains all things. We know wo H
shall all bo resurrected by God's .
power. Bishop C. G. Hyde made n MM
few closing remarks. Tho choir sang.
In Heaven Aro Many Mansions Fair,
and tho bonedlctlon was pronouueed
by J. W. D. Hurren. Tho gravo was iH
dedicated by J. W. D. Hurren. MM
Venice was a loving and obedient HI
