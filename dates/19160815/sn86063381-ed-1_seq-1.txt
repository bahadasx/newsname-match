OPTION
Rev. J. E Cadwell, through his
attorney, Carl L. Heffron, has com
menced suit against Harry Gunsalus,
proprietor of the "Big Harry" soft
drink parlors, for $1,000 damages.
It is alleged that Gunsalus threw wa
ter on Rev. Cadwell while he was
giving a county option address in
front of Gunsalus' drink parlor.
Attorney Heffron in his statement
for Rev. Cadwell, alleges:
"(1) That on the 8th day of Au

early evening of the said day, went
to the east side of Minnesota Avenue
in the City of Bemidji, Beltrami
County, Minnesota, at a place about
twenty feet south of the intersection
of the said Minnesota Avenue with
Third Street in said City, and there
took his stand upon the pavement in
the said street for the purpose of de
livering an address to the public in
support of 'County Option' and for
the purpose of soliciting votes for the
County Option bill which was to be
voted upon on the following Monday
in the said City and County and in
opposition to the 'Liquor Interests'
which were opposed to the passage of
the said County Option measure

With the British Army in the
Field, July 20.(By mail)If it's
possible to imagine dozens of heavy
thunder storms blended into one con
tinuous roar, the shrieking and whin
ing of tons of unseen steel and high
explosives, racing through the sky,
lightning flashes of bursting shells
continuously specking the horizon,
like a giant Fourth of July display^,
then it's partly possible to visualize
the newest phase of war on the west
ern front.
Just Ugly Bloches.
The United Press correspondent
saw and heard all this today from a
high stretch of ground commanding
the scene of a dozen of the most ter
rible conflicts of the British drive
Dotting the green hills and valleys
here and there were distinct dots of
brown, visible against the naked
skeletons of trees. These ugly
blotches of landscape a short time
ago were pretty villages, each with
a church spire and red-topped houses
snuggled down between the rolling
hills Today they were mere ugly
blotches, mostly a pile of bricks that
resembled nothing.
Heavy Counter Attack.
From the vantage point I observed
Vontal Maison,' Bazentin le Grand,
La Boiselle, Nametz and small woods
which have figured prominently in
the communiques. Just beyond the
'range of vision lay Longueval and
Delville wood, where at the moment,
the Germans were engaged in a heavy
counter attack, which gave them back
a part of the wood and a few houses
of the village. A British attack
soon reversed the situation. Fight
ing of this character has been a pe
culiarity of the British offensive. All

Wherever the Germans concentrate
their reserves and carry out a coun

of short duration. A systematic
British advance makes it possible to
retaliate quickly, mostly in force.
News is Censored.
Precaution prevents the publica
tion of news relating to troops and
movements of troops, but it can be
said with safety that there is no
shortage of shells or men or guns be
hind the British line.
From the viewpoint of the non
military observer, there is no short
age of anything. For miles along
the network of country roads well be
hind the fighting lines, great masses
of men in khaki, most of them wear
ing the picturesque steel helmet, are
awaiting for their turn. Motor lor
ries in great droves are also perform
ing their functions. Passing along
the roads, miles and "miles to the rear
khaki is everywhere.
Are Taking Rest.
Peaceful little villages, which fate
has left so near the ravages of the
conflict, still untouched, are filled
with it. Every doorway shows a
"Tommy," every courtyard shows a
group of Tommies. These men are
in billets. Many of them have had
their turn at fighting and are taking
a well earned rest.
Men, freshly arrived from England,
as can be seen from the neweness of
their uniforms, are also seen. The
veteran fighting Tommy is a trifle
more stained.

REPORTED MANAGERS HAVE
AGREED TO 8-H0UR DAY
How to Feed 5,000,000 Persons in
New York in Case of Strike
is Problem.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 15.The bur
den preventing the national railway
strike this afternoon appeared to
have swung from the managers to
the employes. During the managers'
conference it was understood that the
managers had agreed to the basis of
the principles of an eight-hour day,
but demand that the question of over
time pay be subjected to a more far
reaching investigation. Arrive at Nine.
Railway managers and representa
tives of the brotherhoods arrived at
the White House at nine o'clock this
morning to resume their conferences.
Spokesman Elisha Lee carried a small
portfolio It is not known whether
or not this contained a proposition
the managers will make the presi
dent upon which the differences
would be arbitrated.
President Determined.
It is reported that President Wil
son is determined to prevent the
strike if he must make a personal ap
peal to every railroad president and
employe.
How the 5,000,000 persons living
in Greater New York will be fed in
the event of a railway strike is a
problem that is being given cpnsid-
eratte^^yem^iaWneretedyH^
Survey in New York._
Joseph J. Hartigan, secretary of
Mayor 'Mitchell's committee on food
supply, has proposed survey be made
of all sources of food supply, which
could be commandeered if the strike
is declared. With the city in the
grip of the infantile paralysis epi
demic, city authorities are trying to
determine how the 2,225,000 quarts
of milk the city consumes daily could
be brought to this city in the event
of a strike.
Eight-Day Supply.
Meat packers estimated that the
New York supply of meat would last
but eight days if the railways were
tied up. More than 500,000 tour
ists are now in New York, it is esti
mated. How these people could be
fed, to say nothing of their being un
able to return" to their homes and
places of business is also troubling
city officials.
As New York produces practically
no foodstuffs, a strike which would
cut off the city from its food supply
would result in appalling conditions
in a short time, authorities said.

Redby went dry by 9 votes.
Bemidji Goes Dry.
Bemidji cast more votes at this

election this year. Much interest
was shown in the campaign during
the past week, those who favored the
wet side sending literature to all
parts of this district. Bemidji voted
dry by 31 votes, the complete vote
being 366 dry and 335 wet. The

Forty-six precincts out of 88 in the county give a lead of 130 for

Both Sides Confident.
Both the "wets" and drys" are

though both sides admit that the vote

There are 14 saloons in Beltrami
