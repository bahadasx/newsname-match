TO AVERT STRIKE

to Washington,
TO CONFER AT WHITE HOUSE
President Points Out That Walkout of
Railroad Employes Would Be Noth
ing 8hort of Dlaster at the Pres
ent Time Final Break In Negotia
tions Came After Six Hours Con
ference. Washington, Aug. 14. At tho sum
mons of President Wilson both par
ties to the railroad controversy ar
rived in Washington from New York
early today for conference.
The controversy was laid before
the president, at his invitation, after
the workers had flatly refused any
form of arbitration.
The final break came after tho men
had been In secret session In New
York nearly six hours. Reports dif
fer as to tho reason for tho failure of
the negotiations, in view of a cheerful
outlook of the night before. The men
assert they refused arbitration be
cause the railroads Insisted on arbi
trating their "contingent proposition."
The mediators, however, declared the
men rejected their proposition, con
tending that they would not arbitrate
even it the railroads waived the con
tingent proposition.
The statement of the mediators, is
sued by Judge Martin A. Knapp, chair
man of tho board, Just before their de
parture for Washington from- Now
York Is as follows:
"After repeated efforts to bring
about an arbitration of the pending
controversy between the railroads and
their employes In train and yard ser
vice the ITnlted States board of media
tion and conciliation was advised by
the representatives of the employes
that they would not submit the mat
ters in dispute to arbitration In an7
form.
"The employees further stated to
the board that they would not arbi
trate .their own demands even if the
contingent demands of the rallroad3
were withdrawn aud also declined to
suggest any other plan or method for
a peaceful settlement of the contro
versy. "They were informed that their de
cision would be at once made known
to President Wilson and also that the
president claimed the right to a per
sonal Interview with both parties be
fore any drastic action was taken.
This request, of course, was granted,
nnd a large delegation of employes
with a number of railroad managers,
will be In Washington Monday for a
conference with the president."
President Wilson, In a communica
tion addressed to the brotherhoods and
the railroad managers, pointed out
that such a paralysis of business as
would follow a general railroad strike
would be a catastrophe at any time,
but would be nothing short of a dis
aster under present conditions. On
this ground the president based his
request. for a conference with repre
sentatives of both factions before a
strike order is issued by the leaders of
the men.
That the president may succeed in
bringing the opposing factions to an
agreement as to the merits of arbl
tration was Indicated in Mr. GarreU
son's response to a question on that
point,
"I have no comment to make on
what tho president may succeed in
accomplishing." he said. "Our deter
mination to reject arbitration was due
to the attitude of fie railroads. Indif
ference alwayB breeds resistance. And
the railroads have been Indifferent to
the demands of the men. They have
made an honest effort to effect a set
tlement. They have offered to mediate
our demands v. Ithout offering to medi
ate anything in return. Had they
shown a disposition to meet us half
way the situation might now be dif
ferent." LEAVES PRAYER FOR SON.
New York Womtn, In Will, Hopes For

New York. After leaving the bulk
of her property to her son, Arthur
Edward Schlfferman, Mrs. Eugenie
Schlffermnn, who died in her home in
