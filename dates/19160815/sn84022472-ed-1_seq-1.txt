Washington, But is Merely a Precaution. (
Washington, Aug. 15.- Orders for the remaining mobil
ised urtits ,of the national guard to proceed to the border have
been suspended by the' war department. . . . .
No official explanation ha$ been made, but it is known that
the delicacy of the railroad strike
consideration.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, which would have moved some
25,000 men to the border, should not be
taken as an Indication that the Pres
ident's negotiations with the railroad
brotherhoods and the railroad man
agers have taken an unfavorable turn,
but In a measure of caution.
It was considered highly undesiraible
that all the . remaining guardsmen
should bo moved to the border while
there was a possibility of a railroad
strike in which they iight be called
upon to preserve . order throughout
some of the states. ..There Is' even the
possibility that some of the troops 'In
pie event of a Strike, might be called
upon to cuard or operate mall trains
and trains supplying, the troops al
ready on the border. - X ",
The suspension of the orders pre
vents the immediate movement of the
troops from Kentucky, Ohio' and Ver
mont and the "movement of all other
mobilized -units which Were to have
gone .forward as soon as they were
eauiDDed.' Some of the ; Kentucky,
Ohio and Vermont troops ' were about
ready to go to the border. ; "",

ASKS DAMAGES
FROM DENTIST
FOR LOST TEETH
- Declaring that several teeth were
destroyed because of unskilled work,
Lillas M. Selleck . of Stratford has
brought ! suit against Dr. James H.
Fagan, who conducts an ornate den
tal establishment at 925 Main street.
Deputy Sheriff Robert Nichols served
papers on the doctor and attached the
office fixtures. These were afterward
released when a bond of (750 was fur
nished. The suit calls for (500 dam
ages. j
The plaintiff claims she visited Dr.
Fagan March last to have some
bridge work done. She says she paid
him $47 for the work. The complaint
states, "the defendant so negligently
c6nducted himself in performing the
work that several of the plaintiff's
teeth were destroyed and she suffered
greatly In body and mind." - The suit
is returnable to the September term
of the common pleas court. Dr.. Fa
gan denies the plaintiffs charges.

agers. Are Silent After,
Long Meeting Today With
President Wilson. -
Washington, Aug. 15. After,
the committee pf railroad man-i
agers had another conference!,
with President Wilson today it s
became known that a proposal;
was under consideration byi
which the railroads would ac
cept the principal of an 8 hour
day and leave the working out
of its application to 'the inter-
state commerce commission' or
some Body formed for the pur
pose. -J -,,
Whether this plan carina
worked out will not be known
until President Wilson presents
it to the brotherhood leaders. .
The railroads are understood
to be ready to concede the prin-
ciple of v the eight-hour "day,
providing concessions be made
by, the ' emDloves so too heavv
w a ez
'a burden will not be placed up-' ,
on the railroads. ' :
The men take the stand that they .
principally want the eight hour day
on conditions that it shall be enforced '
whenever possible. The railroads are
said to believe It impossible to accept ;
the eight-hour day unless a workable
system of application can be built up.
Members of the managers' committee-.'
said they had no plans for the future - '
and did not know whether they would
be called to the White House again. '
The managers took the position that
the eight-hour flay and the collateral

would not be practicable to accept the -eight-hour

question to arbitration. -

None of . the brotherhood officials
would commit ' himself on what the
attitude of the employes would be to- :
wards such a proposal but 'they did;
not appear optimistic oyer the likell-v
hood of, it proving acceptable. If;
such a proposition were tendered in.

pointed out, they would only refer it;
to,the general board, composed of 600

ter the conference he said that it was ,
impossible as yet to report on the re
sults all that he could say was that
a very, candid -and honest discussion;,
was in' progress about practical basis
of settlement.' x, . ,
. ;The representatives of the board of
railway managers . were the first- to
meet the Prssident today. Before the .
conference Klisha Lee, the managers"
chairman, refused to say whether a
counter-proposal for submission to the
employes had been drawn up. .
. The i members of the - committee
looked' haggard from their prolonged
meeting which "lasted until an early
hour this morning. They straggled'
into the White House by twos and ,
threes. All were ready for the Presl- ,
dent when he entered the conference t
room' promptly at o'clock. '
"At this stage of the proceedings I
can say absolutely nothing," said Mr.
Lee as he entered the white House -He
carried a portfolio of papers. .
