Berlin's Claim to Successes in North
ern Galicia Contradicted by Rus
sians, Who Report Teuton Line
Pierced on a 12-Mile Front.
Berlin announces that Gen. von Bothmer, whose army has been re
ported from Petrograd as being in danger of being cut off, has checked
the Russian drive along the Upper Stripa River in Northern Galicia.
Petrograd claims that the new Aiistro-German line on the Zlota
l.ipa lias been pressed on a twelve-mile front and that von Bothmer's
riiTht flank is seriously threatened west of the Zlota l.ipa River toward
Halicz.
The Italians are making rapid strides in their drive on Austrian terri
tory. To the north of Gorizia they have reached the suburbs of Tolinino,
according to unofficial messages. To the southeast, special despatches
assert, the Italian advance guard has reached a point within thirteen miles
of Trieste.' The greater part of the Austrian fleet is reported to have left
the harbor of Trieste.
Berlin admitted that the British have regained the trenches on the
Sommc front which were captured yesterday by the Germans.
Paris reports the capture of trenches near Pleury on the Verdun
front.

sent an answer to the demands pre
sented to them yesterday by a com
mittee from the recently organized
union of trolleymen.
While none of the union leader
would discuss the reply made by the.
railroad onielals, It Is understood that
Messrs. Shouts nnd Hedley sent word
that they could not ileal with any
nrR.mlzatlon which their company
lid not havo n part In orsanlr.lnr.
If tho reports as to tho contents of
tho answer aro true It may mean a
renewal of tho strike on the lines of
the Xew York Rallwnys Company
the creen car lines and probably on
nil the other surface lines,
The union leaders havo been In con
ference nil day wiutinc ror tne repiy

to act promptly to show tho company
they mean business.

that an anHwer had been rccolved nnd
that It was unfavorable.
I'll havo an Important announcn-
ment to mako late, this afternoon or

ennt comment.
Tho union leaders have announced
their Intention of trlvlnp the publlo
nmplo notice In case nnother strike,
Is ordered.
Relations between the union men
and the officials of the New York Rail
ways Company, already badly strained
by tho dismissal of evcnty-thre of
tho old motormen and conductors slnco
pcaco was declared, wero not Improved
by the two muss meetings of Intorlor
ough employees held last night and ad
dressed by Messrs. Shonts and Hodley,
both of whom advocated tho formation
of an organization of the men to bo
known as tho nrothcrhood of Rapid
Transit Employees.
The union leaders say they wilt Ig
nore any such organltatlon and will
Insist on too company doing business
with tholr committees.

Funsion Asked Action to Pro
tect Forces Now on Rio
Grande in Case of Strike.
TVASHIXGTOX. Aug. 15. Orders
for tho remaining mobilized units of
tho National Guard to proceod to the
border havo been wusponded by tho
Wnr Department.
Tho order to keep the militiamen
at their State mobilization camps
was Issued on the recommendation of
Gen. Kunston. Ills message follows:
"In view of thn possibility of a
general railroad atrlkc, I desire to
call the attention of the War De
partment to difficulties that will
follow In maintaining food supply
not only of troops In this depart
ment but of tho civilian population
as well. These border States pro
duco but little foodstuffs except
cattle. I
"In view of the foregoing I rec
ommend that tho National Guard
organizations which aro about to
stnrt for border stations bo re
tained In their mobilization enmps
until such tlmo us the question of
a general strlko shall havo been
determined."
The suspension of the order, which
would huvo moved some 1:3,000 men.
to the border, should not be taken aa
on Indication that the I'roaldont'e
negotiations with tho Railroad
Brotherhood and the railroad man-
aKoru have taken nn uniavoramo
turn, but tt Is a mensuro of caution
It la considered highly undcslrablo
that all tho remaining guardsmen
should be moved to tho border while
thero la a possibility of a railroad
atrlko In whloh they may bo called
upon to preserve order In some of the
States. There Is also tho possibility
that soma of the troopB In the ovont
of a strike may bo called upon to
guard or operate mull trains and
trains supplying the troops already
on tho border.
The suspension of the orders pre.
vents tho Immediate movement of the
troopa from Kentucky, Ohio and Ver
mont, and the movement of all other
mobilized units which wero to have
gono forward as soon as they wrro
equipped. Borne of tho Kentucky,
Ohio and Vermont troops aro ubout
ready to go to tho border.
It Is clear that tho suspension is not
a revocation of tho orlglnul order.i
and that If the railroad srlko situation
clears up, tho troops will bo moved
to the border lino.

According to thos- present h
showed not the slightest sign of din
appointment when Mr. Lee said It
was, after all, really a question of
practlcnl railroading and not one ot
sentiment, and that If the managers
were to consult their own foellngs
there would be no opposition to a
general eight-hour day, but that they
felt they had to go very cautiously
where such vital Interest! are con
cerned.
This does not mean that the managers
wilt finally rejoct tho President's pro.
posal for an eight-hour day, nor does
It moan that thero la danger of the
present proceodlnga breaking up, as
did the mediation conference. Th
Tiesldent Is understood to be firmly
of the opinion to-day that tho crisis
has actually passed.
Following tho conference, Mr. L
said to Tho Evening World repra-
sentntlvo:
"You want to know If I think tho
the situation Is clearing. Well, If giv
ing facts, showing what could b
dono with a special effort and what t
Impractlcnblo tn railway business,
then l should say the situation has
clcarod considerably. Rear In mtnd I
also havo a conscience and It made
