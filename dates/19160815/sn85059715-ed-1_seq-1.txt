And They Are Willing to Let the
Interstate Commerce Cpmmission
Work It Out.
MANAGERS ARE SILENT
if Any Statement is Made It
Will Be by the President'
Says Mr. Lee.
n^OrtATtn P?C6t
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15. -After
the committee of railroad managers
had another conference with President
Wilson todny it became known
that a proposal was under consideration
by which the rail roads would
accept the principles of an eighthour
day and leave the working out
of its application lo the Interstate
Commerce Commission or some body
formed for the purpose.
The managers' committee left the
White House by a side door. Klisliu
l.ee, the chairman, said:
"We are entirely in the president's
hands and have agreed with him
.hot he will make any statement."
The railroads are understood to
be ready to concede the principle of
the eight-hour day, providing concessions
he made by the employes
so that too heavy a burden will not
lie nlaeed upon the railroads.
The men lake tin- stand that they
principally want the eight-hour day
an condition that it shall be enforced
whenever possible. The railroads
are sa'd to believe it impossible to
ocept the ej'jjht-hour day unless a
workable system of applications can
bo built up. Members of the mana
trees' committee said they had no
plan;- for the future and did not
know whether they v< Id he called
to the While House again.
Tim managers took the position
that the eight-hour day and the col
lateral issues are inseparable and
that it was not practical to accept
t!u- (iuht-hour day and submit the
othei questions to arbitration. All
of the issues are interwoven, they
contend, and must be decided together.
tf ivsis nrnbablo. one of the of
finals said, that if such a proposition
were submitted to them through
the president today that they would
return to New York and place it
aofore the general board.

Railway Situation is the Real
Cause for the Suspension
of the Orders.
IS MEASURE OF CAUTION 1
Issuance of the Suspension
Order Does Not Mean That
a Strike is Certain.
<nr aabojiatio PRisai
WASHINGTON, Aug. I 5.?Orders
for the remaining mobilised units of
the national gun i d In proceed to the
bonier have hen suspended by the
war dopart&ent. No nfllclal explanntlon
hue been made but it ie
known thnt tho dnllency of the railroad
strike nituntIon has been the
moving ronnldorntlon.
The nueponelon of the order which
would have moved 211,000 tnon to the
| border should not bo taken as an ln|
dleatlon that the president's negotta;
lions with the rnllroad brotherhoods
and thn railroad managers have taken
an unfavorable turn but Is a measure
of caution. It is considered highly
undesirable that all the remaining
guardsmen should bo moved to the
border whllo there was a possibility
of a railroad strike llfc which they
might bo called upon to preserve or- ;
der. Thnro Is even the possibility
that nomn of tho troops might be
called upon to guard Or operate mail
trains and trains supplying the troops
ulresdy on tho border,
The suspension ot tho order prevents
lire Immediate movement ot
troops from Kontucky, Ohio, and
Vermont, and the movement of all
oilier Minimized uuuyn wuivu -v.
to have Rono forward an Boon as they
wore equipped.
It In clear that tho miBpenslon Is
not a revocation of the order and If
the railroad strike situation clears up
the troops will be moved to the bor- '
der lino.
Tbo ofllcinl explanation of the. J
change In that difficulties of transportation
and equipment suddenly
developed and made dolay necessary.
It Is known, however, that the rail- ;
