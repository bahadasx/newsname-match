Washington, August 14 Prealdent
Wilson conterrod today with both par
ties to ihe threatened country-wide
railway strike and tonight It appeared
that sufficient foundation had been
laid to furnish a working baals for a
settlement of the differences of em
ployes and employera. The President
will meet both sides again tomorrow.
At the conclualon of the day's con
ferences, the President issued thla
statement:
"I have met both sides and have
gone over the case with the utmost
frankness. I shall not be able to
Judge until tomorrow whether we have
found a feasible baals for settlement."
( .miller ProposltlouN Requested
Tho formal questions are what shall
be arbitrated, If arbitration la to be
resorted to, and what form of arbitra
tion shall be adopted. Representative
of the employee maintain that their
demands for an eight-hour day and
time and a half for overtime Is the
only concrete proposition under dis
cussion. They insisted to the Presi
dent in their conference today
the railroads make some definite coun
ter proposal. If the railroads submit'
ted some proposed form of settlement
they aald, they would be ready to dl
cuss negotiations further.
The employes are understood to be
ready to conaent to the principles of
arbitration If the contingent propos
als of the managers, which the men
claim involve rights they have won In
thirty years' efforts, are eliminated
from consideration, and If arbitration
is conducted by a board on which all
four brotherhoods are represented.
Lender Optimistic
Immediately after learning the em
ployee' position, the President sum
moned the committee of managers
and held a long conference with them
They left the White Houae to confer
among themselves throughout the
night, If necessary, and the general
understanding was, that they discuss
ed the advisability of withdrawing
their "contingency" proposal and sub
mltUng a proposition "without strings"
aB demanded by the men.
While representatives of the em
ployes Insisted that they had not yet
agreed to arbitrate any feature of
their difference, there was a growing
impression that arbitration or some
form of compromise would be agreed
on. At no time, it was said, did the
representatives of the men indicate
that unleas their demands were
granted unqualifiedly they would go
on strike.
Both sides refused absolutely to
discuss their meeting with the Pres
ident of venture any forecast on the
probable outcome of the negotiations,
but leaders ot the two factions were
nptimltic tonight that a strike would
be avoided.
President Makes Xo Proposal
The President, It waa declared,
made no compromise proposition to
either side today. He merely listened
to the employes' representatives and
then talked with the managers and
auggested that some concrete working
basis be agreed on before proceeding
further.
Indicative of his desire to learn
what result came from the railroad
managers' meeting tonight before tak
ing any further step, he arranged an
other meeting with them for 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning and a conference
with the representatives ot the em
ployes for 3 o'clock tomorrow after
noon. Tmorrow'a cabinet meeting
baa been cancelled so the President
may devote most of bis time to the
railroad problem. He cancelled sev
eral engagements today that he might
have the fullest opportunity to talk
with the two sides.
NewlaaelB Art Is Barred
A. H. (Jar rut son, president of th;
Order of Railway Conductors and
spokesman for the employes' repre
sentatives, made it clear today that
under no circumstances will the em
ployes agree to arbitration under thai
New lands Act.
Reports that the President had uotl
tieU the managers that unless soni"
agreement could be reached with the
men, he would Invoke bis power with
Congress to pass an eight-hour law
were circulated, but discounted by
those in close touch with the situation.

lias Not ffeeted the Shipping In and
tint of .Waysvllle So Far If Strike
Come Waysrllle .Hay Not Be
Seriously Affected.
Ileaorts of the Impending general
railroad strike have made no differ
ence In the shipping of freight In and
out of Maysville during the past few
days', according to reports from local
representatives of the railroads. Re
ports have been received from other
cities, mostly larger ones, that unusual
activities have marked their prepaid
tions for a possible tie-up of traffic.
Should a general strike come, in
volving 225 railroads and 2,000,000
men being thrown out of employment,
Maysville will not be as seriously af
fected as some of her neighboring
entucky towns. Owing to the fact
that It Is on the Ohio River Mays
ville need not fear a complete demoral
ization of traffic, although the city will
suffer to a certain extent. Iexlngton,
Frankfort and Purls, cities thai depend
entirely on the railroads for their sup
plies will be greatly hampered. These
cities Tear a coal famine if the strike
is of long duration.
In all of the big cities la the coun
try the food question Is the greates
one to solve In caHe of a general strikf
Maysville Is the center of one of th"
richest farming districts in the coun
try and there is no other larger cltv
within fifty miles to draw upon the
country for supplies. Maysville coiiM
easily get all of the products within
twenty-five miles for her own use.
From the late dispatches from
Washington It seems that the matter
will be referred to a mediation board.
This will save a great amount of time
and will probably avert a strike. The
whole country Is watching the result.
Let us hope that It will come out all
right
