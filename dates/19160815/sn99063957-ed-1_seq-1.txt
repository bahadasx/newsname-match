(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Aug. 15. Recapture by the
British of about 700 yards of German
trenches on the iSomme battle front and
a successful French blow on the most
important sector of the Verdun battle
front, were recorded in official dis
jr.tches today.
The German war office thin afternoon
admitted the British victory on the
iSomme front. The line of Germnn
trenches carried by the British north
and northwest of Pozieres and subse
quently retaken by the Germans were
again conquered in fighting that began
Sunday morning ana continued last
night. Berlin, however, announced the
repulse of all other British and French
attacksfon the Somme front.
In fighting northeast of Verdun the
t rench captured German trenches on a
Mm yurd front to a depth of 100 yards,
it was officially announced at Paris.
The gain was made north of Chapel of
Waint rine, at the point where the Ger
man line dips closest to the city of Ver
dun.
Conflu'ting claims came from Petro-1
r,,l nH R.fU. tn,ln r.
of the great Russian drive on Lemberg.
An officinl statement from Petrograd
announced that another Russian force
1ms crossed the Zlota I.ipa river and in
dicated that the new Zlota Lipa line, to
which Bothmer retreated from the river
Rtrypn, must soon be abandoned under
lieavy Russian pressure. The German
T.ar office announced that Bothmer re
pulsed strong Russian attacks, inflict
ing heavy losses on the enemy.
The Italian war office claimed the
capture of several sections of enemy
trenches west of San Grado and Mount
Pccinka and the capture of ,675 prison
ers in that region and in fighting east
of Goritz.
Berlin's officinl report of the repulse
of attacKs south of Lake Doiran indi
cated a- continuation of' the lively pa
trol fighting in the Bnlkans.
Petrograd, Aug. 15. The Russians
have pierced the new Aiistro-Germnn
line on the Zlotn Lipa river at a new
' point, having crossed to the west bnuU
of the river in a 12 mile advance from
the upper Strypa, it was officially an
nounced today.
Other Russian forces have crossed to
Hie western bank of the Zlota Bistritzn,
Huiithwest of Stanislnu.
In the south the Russians approach
ing Halitz are several miles west of the
Zlota Lipa and seriously threaten Gen
iMiil Bothmer 's right flank and rear. I'n-
Jess the Russian advance is speedily
necked, the Austro-Uerinnns must con
tinue their retreat until they reach
the Gnista I.ipa river, a retirement of
nearly 35 mitos on a wide front.
The Austrian have almost entirely
ceased their attacks in the extreme
Nonthonst, near the Carpathians, ac
cording to advices from the trout to
day. Ten days ago t lie arrival of strong
lmdiea of Austrian and German rein
f orcements was followed by heavy at

London, Aug. 15. Possibilities
complications in -the Far Kast

seen today in reports of a clash be
twecn Chinese nnd Japanese troops at
Chengciiintun, northeast of Peking.
Tokyo dispatches asserted that the
Chinese were the aggressors, attacking
the Japanese garrison and later be
seiging the Japanese in the Chengchia

soldiers were reported to have been
killed.
Japanese reinforcements nre en route
to the relief of th garrison.
This is the first report reaching Lon

and the first disturbance of its kind in
northern China where the Japanese re
cently sent more troops. Chinese ami
Japanese police finished in Amoy,

last year and made another visit last

"In a sense every civilized man in

Amendment
By Perry Arnold
(United Tress staff correspondent)
Tacomn, Wash., Aug. 15. Governor
Ilrrghcs is putting the personal punch
into his speeches in Washington. He
began today to use the personal pro
noun in pledges and promises.
" If you elect me to an executive
office," he told an audience her to
day, "I propose to give you my full
executive influence. "
This was the first time that the re
publican nominee has used the intimate,
personal pronoun. It was indicative
of a further step in the governor's
warming up process. In his speech
es across the continent so far the G.
O. P, aspirant for presidential honors
has heretofore confined himself to
speaking of the party. The only per
sonal references were veiled.
The governor has reallv only one
speech. It starts off with a plea for
unity, of Americanism, touches on pre
paredness, attacks democratic policies
on both matters; swings to the Mexi
can program, jumps back to an attack
on the democrats for governmental in
efficiency "pork" methods, and lack
of co-ordination and ends with a pledge
of..', better government under repuo
lienn rule. Roosevelt usually had six
ditferent specifies in Ins campaign
ing, and Taft at least four. Both al
tered these speeches to emphasize some
different section. Hughes localizes tae
situation.
Has His Speech Polished
Today liughes chose inefficiency as
his mam battering ram in the assault
against the democratic citadel. But
what was remarked most by those who
have beea associated with him since the
start of his campaign trip was the .ex
traordinary "polish" which the nom
inee nns now applied to this one speech
It was a perfect indication that tae
governor has now reached the summit
of his campaign, with skill. He put in
new synonyms, new similes, new epi
grams and consequently he got as b:g
a reception here as anywhere on the
trip.
In addition to his Tacoma speech to
day, the governor was due to speak to-

No Road In Competition It
Makes State Wak While

A shortage o'f cars amounting to be
tween 1,300 and 1.400 in California and
to 631 on the Portland division north
of Ashland is the situation according
to latest reports received from the
Southern Pacific compnny by the Ore
gon public service commission. Tim
entire shortage in Oregon is given ai

So acute has the situation become,
and so urgent has become the demands
of various shippers, that CommiBsionei'
Miller has taken the mntter up vigor
ously with tho Southern Pacific com
pany. In his letter to General Manager
Scott the commissioner says:
"Will you not kindly supply the com
mission with iiformntion as to what we
may expect for the futurcf There is,
in our opinion, a burden resting upon
the company to take core or the Busi
ness offering for the renson that you
have been advised by this commission
from time to time, covering a long per
iod, that unless special efforts on your
part were put forth to relieve the press

now confronts the business interests of
this state would be brought about. Your
monopoly -of this territory is. absolute,
and we" demand and insist that yoi
supply the necessary facilities for fullj

This letter was written immediately
following the receipt of a complaint
from the Ewouna Box compnny of Kls,
math Vails, which stated that the com
pany's customers ,were threatening suit
on account of its inability to furnish
shooks. A complaint is also on file with
tho commission from the Klamath
Manufacturing company of Klamath
Falls, which sets forth that the com
pany is unable to hnndle its products
because of its inability to get cars.

BE SENTTO BORDER
Threatened Strike and Fact
That Supplies Could Not
Be Sent, the Cause
Washington, Aug, 15. Because of
the threatened railroad strike the war
department today suspended indefinite
ly the proposed movement to the bor
der of between 25,000 and 35,000 mo
bilized militia in state camps last week
ordered to the Mexican line.
The reason for suspending the order
is a possible shortage of supplies and
difficulty of obtaining transportatioa
for the men. It has no connection, it
is said, with possible use of the troops
during the threateacu strike.
Until further onlers are issueu none
of the organisations who are preparing
to leave state camps win be sent iq
the border.
The order to keep the militiamen at
their mobilization camps was issued oo
reeommciulatioa of General Funston.
Funston's messaee follows:
"In view of the possibility of a gen-
ernl ra road strike I desire to call tne
attention of the war department to
difficulties that will follow in main

Better Feeling
EACH SIDE IMPRESSED 1 1
WITH DUTY TO PUBLIC
Those In Touch With Situation
Feel Sure Strike Will
Be Averted
By Robert J. Bender,
(United Press staff correspondent!;
Washington, Aug. 15. President
Wilson completed his second day of ne
gotiations to prevent the threatened na
tional railroad strike with the end not
yet in sight.
After a conference which lasted for
an hour and 35 minutes' with the rail
road employes' representatives this aft
ernoon, it was announced the president
would see both sides again tomorrow.
"We are not yet through," A. B. Gar
retson, spokesman for the brotherhoods
snid as his committto left the White
House. "Nothing as yet is done. Notta-.
ing is undone. We have made no con
cessions." The employes this afternoon present
ed a counter proposition, the nature of
which has not been disclosed.
The result of today's conferences,
thereforo, is summed up in the faet
that each side has indicated a willing
ness to bring about peace by submit
ting counter propositions for considera
tion of the other.
"Don't say anything about arbitra
tion." was the tip from one of the most
prominent of the brotherhoods board,
"but we are very hopeful regarding the
outcome. There are propositions ana
counter propositions on both sides."
While tho speaker declined to be spe
cific as to what ho meant by his tip
that arbitration was sidetracked, it was
assumed the two sides are more nearly
together than they have hitherto been
and that matters are to be adjusted
"across the table."
Following the conference the White
House issued the following statement:
"There is no change. . There is aa
earnest effort being made to work out
a settlement."
Among those who have closely fol
lowed the situation the belief grew this
afternoon that a strike will be averted.
Chief Garrotson of the conductors'
brotherhood, declared he and his con
ferees would do everything in their pow
er to avoid a strike.
Up to Employes.
Washington, Aug. 15. The burden of
concessions in bringing about an ad
justment of the threatened railroad
strike appeared to have Bwung around
from the railroads to the employes to
After the railroad managers had been
in the White House for more than an
hour and a half it was learned they
had agreed to accept the basic principle
of the eight hour day but they demand
ed tho question of overtime pay be
subjected to a more fur reaching inves
tigation. Their acceptaaco of the basic princi
ple of the eight hour duy is made con
tingent upon agreement by the em
ployes to further and more 'far reach
ing" discussion which should include the
question of overtime pay.
According to ono of the railroad men
who attended the conference, the fol
lowing ia their position:
Accept Eight Hour Day.
"Wo accept the principle of the eight
hour day. Howover, the eight hour day
'question is so obviously and naturally
n unit of the overtime question that
the two will have to bo handled as one
problem.' ' .
It was hoped tho day would bring
forth some grounds upon which a settle
