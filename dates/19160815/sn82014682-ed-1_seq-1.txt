HAWAII TO WAIT
Senate Votes Diown . Ruling of
i Marshall on Amendment
.By Three.to One t
' By C. S. ALBERT. - :' .;".
(Special SUr-Bntleiia CorrcBpondtnca) .
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 4. The
last( hop for prohibition ia the. terri
tory of Hawaii has gone glimmering
for this year. There will be no action
by Congress, either in the direction
cf positive restrictions or reference
to the people of an indication of sen
timent The abandonment of the
Sheppard proposition has thrown the
matter' over for disposition j at the
short session. :
It is true the various senate and
house bills providing for prohibition
in Hawaii never" have reached the
stage of actual consideration. The
best chance seemed to be a short cut
instead of the longer journey around
the township. The Sheppard plan ar
ranged drastic prohibition for the dis
trict of Columbia. A brief amend
ment . including ; Hawaii would have
been added at the proper time when
ever this till came to the last stages.
It was pressed with great vigor by
Mr. Sheppard. . .
Within the last few days it seemed
almost certain that the Sheppard bill
would come to a test vote, being of
fered as an amendment to the district
of Columbia appropriation MIL ; The
opening was afforded when Vice-president
Marshall held that another
amendment, ordinarily held to be not
gcimane, was in order. This greatly
enheartened the advocates of temper
snce. The antis cf the capital city
were so taken by storm and surprise
tiiat they largely augmented the inter
nal revenue receipts. It was naturally
believed that if the one amendment
Vtuck providing prohibition" it would
come to a decisive vote. And with
it Hawaii would have been : dry or
wet. ,
It turned out that a vast propor
tion of senators did not agree with
the vice-president that outside" amend
ments were in order.; More than three
to one they voted the proposition pro
nounced In order. Senator Sheppard
Immediately permitted it to , become
known : that to further efforts for
prohibition in Washington would be
iiade until Congress reassembles next
December.
Thus enJeth another legislative
chapter. .''?-. ""' ' ' '

"So far as Hawaii is concerned, if

made numerous Investigations on this
subject it will be in the nature of
more liberal home rule, and all this
talk of finally having a commission

Looks Like Hughes.
The national committeeman Is
very optimistic regarding the outcome
of the presidential election. He says
that while traveling across the conti
nent he took advantage of the oppor
tunity to talk with people in all walka
of life, as well as with many leaders
in politics, and the general opinion is,
he adds, that, unless there is a change

be. ftlectedr i k&' .'iW ':
"The Mexican and European situa

tion might make the election of either
Wilson or Hughes sure. - Who is go
ing to be the next president is all a
big guess Just now. But if the elec
tion was to be held tomorrow, Hughes
would be elected!"
Breckons talked with Hughes a few
minutes In New York City, but the
latter said nothing more than to ask
a few questions regarding conditions
in Hawaii and to accept the support
of the local Republican party. Wil
liam R. Willcox, chairman of the na
tional committee, was interviewed by
Breckons and R. O. Matheson, editor
of the Advertiser.
"Mr. Willcox is deeply interested In
matters pertaining to Hawaii, and
showed a rather unexpected knowl

Breckons.

The latest developments in . the

a charge of murdering H. Emoto on

will have a hearing before Judge Mon

Forestalling habeas corpus proceed

Fujimoto's behalf by Attorneys Lorrin
Andrews and W. J. Sheldon, Sheriff
Charles H. Rose placed a charge of
first degree murder against him. The
defendant had been held for several
days for Investigation and Judge Ash
ford scored the police for such ac
tions. Andrews and Sheldon, appearing
this morning for Fujimoto, said they
were ready for the hearing, but Prose

for the contin-iance until Friday on,
account of the indisposition of the
prosecution's principal witness, Tome
Emoto, who was nearly' killed with
her husband and who is now near
death at the Qneen's hospital.
"I have been informed," said Chil
lingworth, "that the woman will either
be sufficiently recovered by that time
to give us some valuable information
or will be passed beyond recall."
Arthur McDuf fie, chief of detectives,
ordered Kanemoto's release, after the.

WASHINGTON. D. C. Aug. 4 The
Immigration bill has been laid away
in its little airtight pigeonhole until
next December. It will net be attach
ed as a rider to the child labor mea

this session of Congress.
This final disposition of a bother
some question followed another cau
cus of Democratic senators. The de
claration by Senator Borah that he
would offer the immigration bill In its
entirety as an amendment to the child
labor bill placed the Democrats In
a deep cavity. They were much dis
tressed and sought means of extrica
tion from the predicament that prom
ised much of evil and nothing of good..
Hence, the caucus.
It was deter; lined after a solemn
conclave to Jump in and vote down
the immigration bill when suggested
as an amendment, thereby throwing
it over until next winter. 5 A conclu
sion to that effect had been previ
