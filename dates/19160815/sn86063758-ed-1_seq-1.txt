Columbia, Aug. 13.?For the first j
time since the recent floods there is a i
connecting link between the two S
halves of the State which were com- '
pleted divided, so far as the public
.highways cue concerned, by the deI
struc-tion oi' bridges, the divison lin *,
running irom .Nori.'i \_axuiiiia ^ uu: >
c^ast. through tiie Catawba, A'atere?;
r.nd Santee basin. In order to cross j
this line, it has been necessary for j
the past several weeks to go up iiu>
North Carolina to Gastonia. and cros~ j
t<j Charlotte by ferry, and then come 1
^own by Lancaster. The connecting
i link which has now been established, j
V according to a wire received this
\ afternoon by Commissioner E. j.
' Watson, is tne oia uoocii ieuv, uu ,
Catawba river, abort 5?ven miles we^L!
i
of Lancaster, which is now in full ,
ci eration. j
The route by Gastonia and Char-j
lotte made the distance from Colum-j
i "bh to Camden 2S5 miles, instead of
I 32 via the direct route. The Gooch I

miles. The route by the ferry is i j
Cb ster, Ricsburr:, BascvrrviTe an.1
then across to Lancaster. The'toad
from Chester to Ft. Lawn. Cominte[
sioner Watson states, is one of the
: '"ceot in the State.
I Commissioner Watson is in close
touch with Supervisor West, of Ker
shaw county, in regard to getting 1:1:3
highway opened -;>t Camden. I'nder
the Federal tlood relief Act. road
work is provided for, and Major
Youngberg. who is representing the
Federal government in tiie district- i
tion of the relief fund, has undertaken
to assist Commissioner Watson in
k establishing a ferry at Camden, ana
in this manner relieving the congesJ

several days ago, and it is hoped to:
I have the ferry in operation within the j
next two weeks. Some time during
I this week Major Youngberg, Unitei
States Engineer Towles, who is in
L charge of this road, and CommissionK
Watson will confer with the co n
ty authorities in regard to making tha
road of a more permanent charactci
I The cutting of the State in half has
I < aused such an interruption in th ?
J i nsportation of farm products that
it is vitally important that some ste^s
for relief be taken as early as possi,
b!e. The county ot Kershaw is left
practically helpless. $50,000 had been
spent by the county on the bridg
- hich was destroyed, and a consider j
able portion of this amount is st; 1
owing. I
i
At the point where this bridge was
located, there v.-as a considerable
f bend in the river. During the booas
L the river completely -cut off the bend,!
and tropled the width of its channel, j
W Where the old channel was there is
F now nothing but backwater, and the
approach to the old bridge is now in
tie middle of the main channel of
-the river. I

Together.
Last Tuesday was indeed a .^reat
day I'or our aged grandmother. Mrj.
Sallie Shealy of the old Dutch Fori\
section of Lexington county, for on !
that day she had the rare oppcr*unitv |
to see t:ie memuers or ner mein wm-1
j
ily together once more. This is prob- !
ably one of the largest families rn
Lexington county and practically j
every member was present. The (lay j
was almost perfect for such an occa-!
sion and every one had a jolly good
time.
About 0 o'clock members of the
family began to gather around the;
old homeste;d from nearly every part :
or T^xinsrtcn eountv and many part 's j
? ~ ' * " I
of Newberry county. In addition to I
the family relations Rev. .T. .T. Long, |
pastor of the aged mother, and his j
little son: also Mr. W. S. Lominick of
Newberry and .V'rs. Mary Wessinger i
another aged mother of Lexington.!
were present as visitors to this '
great reunion.
1
Our grandmother if permitted by;
kind providence to see her next birthclay
will be ninety years old. She is j
the wire oi uaniei ^;e>:y. who ut'iu^ :
a member of that valiant n::mbr
t :at served in the war Between the
States answered his last roll call six
years ago having joined his comrades
in the great beyond.
This aged mother has six children'
living namely. James E of Newberry;
John C. of Lexington; Mrs. Cephas j
Sease of Lexington; Pat \V. of New-1
berry; \\\ Kiliian of Lexington, and
L. Cohen of Lexington, who still j
vrciri.ic .it thp nlH homestead. She i
lias one son dead, namely. Xoah R. i
who died about fifteen years ago. As ;
her gr-.mdchildren she has fifty-seven ;
in number living and three dead. 'As j
her great grandchildren, she has \
106 living and 11 dead. The entire;
family, therefore, numbers 164 living

i
strikingly was the opportunity for all
, Members to again dine together. Th^
! table w-:is located in a beautiful
grovo in front of the home and all en
| jo, c the opportunity of eating v :e
! of those good dinners prepared by
' the good ladies of the family. Tho
I table was bountifully spread.
j Rev. Long made a short address
| just before dinner which was another
1 great feature of the occasion. In hii
:
j address Pastor Long stated that nr4-oped
kind providence would permn j
I this aged mother to celebrate ne: j
100th birthday.
i After a day of pleasant conversa- j
tions the members 01 uie ia;nn> vie |

that they may (again have the privi-:
