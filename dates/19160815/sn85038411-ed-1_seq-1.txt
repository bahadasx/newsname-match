By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 15. After the
committee of railroad managers had
another conference with President
Wilson early to-day it became known
that proposal was under consideration
bv which the railroads would accept
the principle of an eight-hour day
and leave the working out of its ap
plication to the Interstate Commerce
Commission or some body formed for
the purpose. Whether this plan can
be worked out will not be known until
President Wilson presents it to the
brotherhood leaders.
The railroads are understood to be
ready to concede the principle of the
eight-hour day providing concessions
be made by the employes so too heavy
a burden will not be placed upon the
railroads.
The men take the stand that they
principally want the eight-hour day
on conditions that it shall be enforced
whenever possible. The railroads are
said to believe it impossible to accept
the eight-liour day unless a workable
system of application can be built up.
Members of the managers' committee
said they had no plans for the future
and did not know whether they would
be called to the White House again.
Contend Issues Interwoven
The managers took the position that
the eight-hour day and the collateral
Issues are inseparable and that it
■would not be practicable to accept the
eight-hour day and submit the other
question to arbitration. All of the
issues are interwoven they contend,
and must be decided together.
Representatives of the brotherhoods
heard of the proposal with interest
but insisted however that the proposi
tion was not a new one.

officials said, "that the railroad man
agers had such a proposition in mind."
Would Go Before Board
None of the brotherhood officials
would commit himself on what the
attitude of the employes would be to
ward such a proposal but they did not
appear optimistic over the likelihood
of it proving acceptable.
It was pointed out by the employes'
representatives, however, that if such
a proposition were tendered in con
crete form to them they would only
refer It to the general board, com
posed of 600 committee chairmen now
in New York.
It was probable one of th.e officials
said that if such a proposition were
submitted to them through the Presi

New York and place It before the
general board.
Tumulty Makes Statement
Secretary Tumulty issued the fol
lowing statement:
The President spent an hour
and a half this morning with the
representatives of the railway
management. After the confer
ence he said that it was Im
possible as yet to report on the
results; all that he could say was
that a very candid and honest
discussion was in progress about
a practical basis of settlement.
Bend Energies For Settlement
President Wilson and representa
tives of railway employes and man
agements bent their energies to seek
ing settlement of the threatened na
tion-wide railroad strike. As a sequel
to the conferences of each side with
the President yesterday, other meet
ings were arranged for to-day and at
the end of these the President hoped
to be able to develop a plan for break
ing the apparent deadlock between
employers and employes.
First this morning representatives
of the managements came to the
White House. Sleepy-eyed, many pre

After Vain Search For Wife,
Virginian Attempts Suicide
James L. Jackson, aged 24, Goshen,
Virginia, is in the Harrishurg hospital
in a critical condition, following an
attempt to commit suicide last night
by drinking carbolic acid, while sit
ting in River Front park.

despaired because he could not find
his wife. He left a note which they
found, telling the story. With it was
a written request that in case of acci
dent his mother, Mrs. M. B. Jackson,
Goshen; and Miss Jane M. Robertson,
Charlottesville, Va., should be notified.
The man drank the poison in view of
many passersby. When Jackson fell
to the ground, men in the park ran
to police headquarters, and summon

physicians used the stomach pump,
but do not expect Jackson to recover.

Emperor William is again on the
eastern front where the Austro-Ger

the Russians in Galicia and Volhynla.
In the latter region the opposing
forces apparently are at a standstill,
but in Galicia the onward sweep of
General Brusstloff's forces is continu
ing with rapidity.
The Zlota Lipa line to which the
Austrians fell back after the forced
evacuation of their positions along the
Stripa is apparently not destined to
hold for any length of time. Petro

crossing to the western banks of the

Italian Dreadnaught
Catches Fire and Blows Up;
300 Reported Drowned
Paris. Aug. 15. The Italian dread
naught Leonardo De Vinci caught Are
and Mew up in the harbor of Taranto,
Italy, and 300 of her crew were drown
ed says a Turin dispatch to the Petit
Journal. The date of the disaster is
given only as a day in August.
The fire, says the dispatch, was dis
covered in the dreadnaught's kitchen
and spread rapidly. The captain im
mediately ordered the magazine flood
ed and tried to beach the battleship,
but one magazine exploded before
this cofjld be done. The vessel was
turned over on her side and a large
number of the crew were thrown into
the sea. ,
It is believed that the battleship can
be righted and refloated.
The Leonardo Da Vinci was a sister
ship of the Conte Di Cavour and of
the Giulio ("esare and was launched in
October, 1911. Her displacement was
22,000 tons and she was 575% feet
long, 9194 feet beam and carried ai
total company of 957 men. Her main
battery consisted of thirteen 12-inch i
! guns and her secondary battery to |
stand off torpedo attack was composed
of eighteen 4.7-inch guns. Her en
gines were of 24,000 horsepower de
signed to develop a speed of 22.5
knots.

Washington, Aug. 15. Orders for

be taken as an Indication that the
President's negotiations with the rail
