Preliminary Statement to
Gbeat Britain's Rb{dy to
U. S. Protest
WhflMngtaw Mm- !•»—explana
tory statement of how Great Britain's
examination of malls is being con
ictod was presented to Secretary
naing by the British embassy. It
preparatory to the more compre
hensive reply to American representa
tions now being prepared jointly by
the London and Paris foreign office.
Figures given in the statement show
the average time for aaamtnation of
intercepted mail is from one to three,
days. The minimum delay to mail be
tween the United States and Holland
is given at two days and the maxi
mum at seven. Danish mails have
been delayed from seven to ten days
when it has been necessary to remove
them from a ship otherwise, only
tont dttys.
"It is admitted," says the state
ment, "that at the outset, neutral cor
respondence in whioh enemy interests
were in no way concerned was sub
jected to a delay which is greatly
regretted and which has since been
reduced to a minimum- It must not
be imagined that the mails were re
moved from neutral ships for exam
ination without careful consideration
of the arrangements which would be
required to deal with them as quickly
as possible. All preparations which
seemed neceesary were with this ob
ject, but, unfortunately, thOBe respon
sible for them were not aware of
some of the difficulties which would
be enoonntered.
"For instance, there was no reason
to suppose that (as proved to be the
case) mall bags marked as despatched
from one neutral country to another
neutral country would contain noth
ing but mails for or from an enemy
country, that bags represented as con
taining printed matter would contain
rubber, coffee. Jewelry, etc., some
times dlBguised as newspapers, as well
as correspondence of all kinds, regis
tered and unregistered, or that per
sons writing to or from enemy coun
tries would already have adopted the
practice of sending their letters under
cover to intermediaries in neutral
countries, or that great numbers of
complete slicks appearing to contain
merely business circulars from neutral
countries would aontaln in reality
nothing but propaganda from Ger
many under covers bearing neutral
postage stamps."

Railroad Strike Situation

NO EXPLANATION
Known, However, That Del
icacy of Road Trouble
is the Cause.
Washington, Aug. IS.—Orders for
the remaining mobilized units of the
national guard to proeeed to the bor
der have been suspended by the war
department.
No official explanation was made,
but it is known that th* delicacy of
the railroad strike situation has been
under consideration.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, fehlch would have movpd
some 25,000 should not be taken ae
an indication that the president's ne
gotiations with the railroad brother
hoods and railroad managers had
taken an unfavorable turn, but tbat
it is a measure of caution.
It is considered highly undesirable
that all the remaining guardsmen
should be moved to the border, while
the possibility of a strike in which
they will be needed to preserve order.
There is even a possibility that
some of the troops, tn the event of a
strike, might operate mall trains and
supplying troops already at th*
CSSr'
Piwutts immediate Movement
Th* suspension at ths orders pre
vents the immediate movement of
troops from Kentucky, Ohio and Ver
mont and (he movement of all other
mobilized units which would have
gone forward as soon as equipped.
The suspension clearly is not a
revocation of ordera. If the strike
situation clears up. the troops will be
moved to the border.
The official explanation of the war
department was that the difficulties of
transportation of the equipment
which suddenly developed have made
the delay necessary.
It Is known, however, that the rail
road situation Is the real cause.
A telegram from Major General
Funston, made public by the war de
partment, disclosed that the general
recommended the suspension of the
order.

Workable System Must be

Statement is Made.
Washington, Aug. 16.—After th*
committee of railroad managers had
another conference with President
Wilson today, it became known that
a proposal is under consideration by
which the railroads would accept the
principle of the eight-hour day, leav
ing the working out of its application
to the interstate commerce commis
sion or some other body formed for
that purpose.
Secretary Tumulty issued the fol
lowing statement:
"The president spent an hour and
a half this morning with the repre
sentatives of the railway managers.
After the conference, he said that It
was impossible as yet to repdrt on
the results, and all that he could say
was. that a very candid and honest
dlsoussion was in progress about a
practical basis of settlement."
Whether the plan considered can be
worked out can not be known until
the president presents it to the broth
erhood leaders.
'Want Oonoeestona.
The railroads are understood to be
"read ro «oftesd» the "principle of th*
eight-hour day, providing there are
concessions made by the employes so
that a too heavy burden will not be
placed on the railroads.
The men take the stand that they
principally want an eight-hour day
on the conditions that it be enforced
whenever possible.
The railroads are said to believe it
impossible to accept an eight-hour
day unlese a workable system of ap
plication can be built.
The members of the mamgess11
committee said they had no plans for
the future and did not know whether,
they will be called to the White,
House again.
Went to White House Early.
The committee of railroad manag-.
ers reached the White House to con
tinue their conference with President.
Wilson at 9 a. m. Ellsha Lee, the
managers' chairman, refused to say
whether a counter-proposal for sut£
mission to the employes had been
