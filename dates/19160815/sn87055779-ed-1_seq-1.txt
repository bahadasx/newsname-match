OLD HURT CITY
Great Sources of Food and
Necessities Would be Cut
Off Should Roads Tie up.
Just how would South Bend lie af
fected shoull the imminent railway
strike develop, is a question which
ir.a.y not have occurred to the major
ity of citizens, although it is a vital
topic with manufacturers and tlios-o
who depend upon the transportation
facilities of the nation to disp.se of
their products. With more than 4 0.
euo trainmen striking and at least
-lb" of the most important railroads
in the country tied up, the nation
would be deprived of its principal
means of supply, and South Bend
would come in fir its share of loss
brought about by such conditions.
Not more than 100 trainmen reside
in South Herd who would be called
out, should a strike be declared. The
(irand Trunk Western Co. train
men belong to the brotherhood
which is now negotiating with the
railroads and conferring witJi Bres t
Wilson, but these trainnu n would
not be called out. The Grand Trunk
is a Canadian company and not im
plicated in the American difficulties.
But the employes of the New York
Ontral. the Vandalu and the Michi
gan Central lines would strike should
the order he issued. These men are
members of the brotherhood and
subject to the strike call.
fiiKories Would Ilo Short.
How would South Bend secure its
grocery, meat, coal and ice supply
should the trainmen strike?
How wonld the manufacturers dis
pose of their goods without the rail
r.ttd! in operation?
These are the two principal prob
lems which would face the city in
i'so of a strike.
South Bend would not suffer to
the same extent as other cities, par
ticularly larger towns, according to
those who are studying the situation.
It is pr.bable that th'-rc would be a
shortage of groceries. Because ofj
t Vif hiVl Y ,Ti i t -4- lw. r.M,..l.-.. I
dealers have been unable to carry
larg- stocks nrid depend upon sup
plies from Cl icago and other huge
cities.
