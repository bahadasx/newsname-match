Degrees.
Athens, -Aug. 14. The wonderful

King George of Greece and the sum

stantine. is no more. The once heavi
ly wooded slopes of Mt. Parties are as
naked today as those of Mt. Pentelicon
or any other of the Attica hills. The
tens of thousands of dollars spent in
cultivating a flourishing pine wood, as
an example of what might be done
with forestry in barren Attica, have
been bt-rned up as completelv as if
the banknotes themselves had been
thrown in the fire. The lives of three
officers, 120 soldiers and an unknown
number of shepherds and villagers have
added tragedy to the disaster.

BRAN DEIS NOT TO SERVE
ON MEXICAN COMMISSION
Informed President Wilson Mass of
Court Business is Too Great.
"Washington, Aug. 14. Associate
Justice Louis D. Brandeis of the su
preme court, informed President Wil
son tonight that because of the mass
of business before the court he would
be unable to accept the president's
designation to serve on the joint com
mission which will attempt to solve
the difficulties between the United
States and .Mexico.
Justice Brandeis conferred with the
president and Attorney General Greg
ory late in the day and the question
of the justice's accepting was gone
over thoroughly. Later the following
letter from Justice Brandeis to the
president was made public at the
White House:
"My dear Mr. President: I appre
ciate the opportunity for high service
which membership on the Mexican
commission wolud present. But upon
consultation with the chief justice I
find that the state of the business of
the court at the present time to be
such that it is my duty not to under
take this . important constructive
task."
The given out of Justice Brandeis'
letter was the lirst formal announce
ment that he had been offered the
post, although it has been known de
finitely that he and Secretary Lane
were two of the three men selected by
the president for membership on the
commission. The name of the third
man has not been made public.
The general understanding had been
that both Justice Brandeis and Sec
retary bane had accepted places on
the commission and there have boon
intimations that the justice's decision
to withdraw was reached after Chief
Justice White had interposed objec
tions. TUare was no official confirma
tion of that, however, as all officials
concerned have refused to discuss the
subject.
BRITAIN NOT TO UNDERTAKE
REGISTRATION REFORMS
Too Complex a Problem In the Midst
of a Great War.
London, Aug. 14, 6 p. m. The de
cision of cabinet that the undertaking
of new franchise and registration re
forms in the midst of a great war
was too complex and controversial a
problem was announced by Premier
Asquith in the house of commons to
day. At a time, said the premier, when
the war had reached a happy, promis
ing stage and when it more than ever
required the absolute concentration of
the government, it was imposs-i! le to
consider the questions involved in a
revision of the franchise. He further
implied that any new bill for franchise
reforms in the future must, of neces
sity, include women.
After a brief criticism of Sir Ed
combatant. irrespective of age, was
ward Carson, who urged that every
entitled to vote, and contended there
was no reason why the women s
claims
should stand in the way of
giving all combatants a vote, the
house passed the first reading of the
lull extending the life of the present
parliament. A separate bill, bringing
into force a new register on the basis
of present qualifications, on May 31
next, will be introduced in the hous2
tomorrow.
There is no doubt that one of the
main reasons for the government's
avoidance of the franchise problem
was the threat of the women that they
would refuse to recognize any change
in the franchise in favor of fighting
men which failed at the same tim to
recognize women's rights to the fran
chise. GOMPERS CHARACTERIZED
AS "A PUBLIC NUISANCE'
By Senator
Sherman in
Speech On
Shipping Bill.
Washington. Aug. 14. President
Samuel Gompers of the American
Federation of Labor, was character
ized as "a public nuisance" by Sena
tor Sherman of Illinois, in a digres
sion today from a senate speech on
the shipping bill.
"There is no more tyranical out
rageous injustice than that of lead
ers who live on the sweat of other peo
ple's brows. Mr. Gompers is a public
nuisance."
Referring to the Indianapolis and
Los Angeles .dynamite situation Sher
man declared that the federation had
"posted the cause labor by collecting
funds from laboring men for the de
fense of these criminals.
"Mr. Gompers never apologized to
anybody," he continued, 'but it was
the most fortunate thing that ever
happened to Mr. Gompers that he
himself escaped indictment on these
same charges.
I ve been owing to Mr. Gompers
for some time and I'm handing it to
him now, and I'm responsible politi
cally and personally."
OTTAWA NURSES REFUSED
ADMISSION TO UNITED STATES.
Authorities of That City to Make Pro

Ottawa, Ont., Aug. 14. The city au
thorities will make representations to
Washington, it was announced today,
respecting treatment received by
nurses from Ottawa, who were last
Friday night refused admission to the
United States at Alburg, Yt., under
the alien nurses' lawT. The nurses
had been engaged by a New York
hospital to help fight the infantile
paralysis epidemic.
Th" authorities here say that there
was no question of the terms of the
law being trespassed, as the nurses
were on a mission of mercy for which
they volunteered. When they reached
the border, the nurses say, they were
dragged from their berths at night and
put out into the rain. They had to
return here, and sav that a change of
i regulations is not likely to induce them
to leave Canada again- .
Hughes Replies
to Griticisims
THAT HE WAS NOT CONSTRUC
TIVE IN HIS POLICIES
AT OPEN AIR MEETING
Stands for Protective Tariff, For a
Budget System, the Elimination of
the Pork Barrel, and the End of
Waste and Extravagance
Cour d' Aline, Idaho. Aug. 14.
Charles E. Hughes, replying today to
criticisms that he was not construc
tive in his policies, declared at an
open air meeting here that he stood
for a protective tariff, for a budget
system, the elimination of the pork
barrel, the end of waste and extrava
gance and the appointment to public
service of men qualified for office.
"Is that not constructive?" Mr.
Hughes asked, "I believe that they are
the fundamentals of constructive pol
icies which this nation is facing to
day." War Cannot Sustain Prosperity.
Mr. Hughes discussed the democra
tic slogan of prosperity.
"We cannot afford in this country,"
he said, "to assume that our (prosper
ity will take care of itself, who is so
foolish as to believe and to be decided
by a prosperity maintained by the
European war? Our opponents as
sume to ascribe to themselves the ben
efits that have accrued from that great
contest. Their statements will not
stand the test of careful analysis. For
example they point to the trade in
munitions of war and say that that is
but slight comparison with the other
industries of the country. The manu
facture and sale and munitions have
connected with it considerable devel
opment of prosperity as a part, of the
sale rind mere manufacture of muni
tions itself.

HUGHES ADDRESSES
AUDIENCE OF WOMEN
Reiterated Statement of His Belief in
Equal Suffrage.
Spokane, Washn., Aug. 14. Charles
E. Hughes today addressed his first
audience composed solely of women
voters. They heard him in the first
of two speeches delivered here. All.
Hughes touched upon suffrage and his
views concerning it, and reiterated to
a large extent to the speech in Idaho
today.
" sneak to you women as I do to
men," the nominee said. "I did not
come here to make a different kind of
r-pceeh from the kind I make to men.
I know you are solicitous about the
welfare of this country. There is no
doubt that the heart of womanhood is
patriotic ail through."
Mr. Hughes' salutation of tho wom
en us "fellow citizens" was applauded.
He told them he was interested in
"good national housekeeping" and the
means of effecting it.
"We must have in this country a
different notion about the conduct of
our business than we have had in the
years gone by," he said. "This world
is not the world of even twenty-five
years ago. This is n world that has
foand itself. It has found itself in the
depression of a terrible Gethsemane.
Horrible as is the spect of war, as
frightful as is the waste, we cannot
look upon them without realizing that
a new Europe is emerging from this
struggle. We ca.nnot contemplate the
conditions of twentieth century with
out knowing that there is to be a new
spirit in the United States if our pros
perity i to have a firm foundation.
It must be a spirit which demands ef
ficient, impartial government in the
interests of all people.
LONDON QUARANTINE
AGAINST PARALYSIS
Urged fay the Times Calls For Exer
cise of Precaution.
London, Aug. 14. The Times today
urges the government to enforce a
most rigid quarantine against infantile
paralysis now prevalent in New lorn.
"At the moment when we have huge
armies of men in training," says the
Times, "an outbreak of this disease
would be a great calamity. For the
sake of our children, too, we must take
precautions. Quarantine regulations
should be enforced on passengers
coming from New York and other in
fected areas and a thorough disinfec
tion carried out in all cases where a
shadow of doubt exists. If we neglect
precautions and the epidemic spreads
here we shall have only ourselves to
blame."

Hartford, Conn., Aug. 14. The state
hoard of health, through Dr. John T.
Black, secretary, announced tonight
that it would recommend to the vari
ous school boards throughout the state

ments can be made to protect children
from infantile paralysis. Dr. Black
and A. J. Wolff will represent Connec
ticut at the conference on the epidemic
to be held later in the week at Wash
ington. Thirty-five new cases of the
disease have been reported as devel

cases in the state.

Railroad Strike
is Hanging Fire
PRESIDENT WILSON CONFERRED
WITH PARTIES YESTERDAY
BASIS FOR SETTLEMENT
Leaders of Trainmen at Conference
Insist That the Railroads Make
Some Counter Proposal to the De
mand Made by Their Employes
Washington, Aug. 14. President
Wilson conferred today with both par
ties to the. threatened country-wide
railway strike, and tonight it appeared
that sufficient foundation had been
laid to furnish a working basis for a
settlement of the differences of the
employers and employes. The presi
dent will meet both sides again tomor
row. At the conclusion of the day's con
ferences, the president issued this
statement:
"I have met both sides and have
gone over the caso with the utmost
frankness. I shall not be able to judge
until tomorrow whether we have found
a feasible basis for settlement."
Employes Want Counter Proposal.
The foremost q-uestions are what
shall be arbitrated, if arbitration is to
be resorted to, and what form of arbi
tration shall be adopted. Representa
tives of the employes maintain that
their demands for an eight hour day
and time and a half for overtime are
the only propositions under discussion.
They insisted to President Wrilson in
their conference today that the rail
roads make some definite counter pro
posal. If the railroads submitted some
proposed form of settlement, they said,
they would be ready to discuss nego
tiations further.
Conditions of Arbitration.
The employes are understood to be
ready to consent to the principle of
arhitration if the contingent proposals
of the managers, which the men claim
involve rights they have won in thirty
years' efforts, are eliminated from
consideration and if arbitration is con
ducted by a board on which all four
brotherhoods are represented.
Immediately after learning the em
ployes' position, the president summon
ed the committee of managers and held
a long conference with them. They
left the White House to confer among
themselves throughout the night, if
necessary, and if the general under
standing was that they discussed the
abrity of withdrawing their "contin
gency" proposals and submitting a
proposition ''without strings," as de
manded by th emen.
Growing Impression of Arbitration.
V ana representatives of the em
ployes insisted that they had not yet
agreed to arbitrate any feature of their
differences, there was a growing im
pression that arbitration, or some form
of compromise, would be agreed upon.
At no time, it was said, did the repre
sentatives of the men indicate that un
less their demands were agreed upon
unqualifiedly.
Both sides refused absolutely to dis
cuss their meeting with the president
or to venture any forecast on the
probable outcome of the negotiations,
but leaders of the two factions were
optimistic tonight that a .strike would
be averted.
President Made No Compromise Propo
sitions. The president, it was declared, made
no compromise propositions to either
side tcrlay. He merely listened to the
employes' representatives and then
talked with the managers and sug
gested that some concret ewcrking
basis be agreed upon before proceed
ing further. Indicative of his desire to
learn what results come from the rail
road managers' meeting tonight, before
taking any further step, he arranged
another meeting with them for 9
o'clock tomorrow morning, and a con
ference with the representatives of the
employes for 3 o'clock tomorrow after
noon. Tomorrow's cabinet meeting has
been cancelled so that the president
may devote most of his time to the
railroad problem. He cancelled sev
eral engagements today in order to
have the fullest opportunity to talk
with the two sides.
Special Eoard of Arbitrators.
A. B. Carretson, president of the Or
der of Railway Conductors and spokes
man for the employes' representatives,
made it clear today that under no cir
cumstances will the employes agree to
arbitration under the Newlands act.
The boards of arbitration provided by
that act. thev maintain, are too smalt.
The balance of power, they contend, is j
too close, and as a result the. employes
have suffered. Indications were that
the president, recognizing this situa
tion, might propose a special board of
arbitration, if the negotiations reach
the arbitrating stage, composed of as
many as twelve men, including repre
sentatives of all the brotherhoods.
Might Invoke Aid of Congress.
Reports were circulated that the
president had notified the managers
that, unless some agreement could be
reached with the men. he would in
voke his power to influence congress
to pass an eight hour law; but these
rumors were discounted by those in
close touch with the situation.
"I would fight any attempt to pass
such a measure," was the terse remai;fc
of Mr. Garretson upon hearing the re
port. There was discussion today of the
possibility of the president being chief
arbitrator in the dispute, but his po
sition was understood to be that he
has not the time. There was a possi
bility that, instead, he might name the
so-called neutrals on the board.
BELIEVES ARBITRATION
WILL BE THE OUTCOME.
G. W. W. Hanger of Federal Board of
Conciliation.
New York, Aug. 14. Arbitration of
the differences between the railroads
and their employes will be the outcome
of the conferences in Washington be
tween President Wilson and repre
sentatives of the roads and the men,
was the opinion here tonight of G. W.
W. Hanger of the federal board of
mediation and conciliation.
"When the president expresses a
wish it virtually is a command, saia
Mr. Hanger, "and he wishes them re
spected." Mr. Hanger remained in
New York with Martin A. Knapp, an
other member of the board, while w.

Danish Action on
ale of Islands
LOWER HOUSE FAVORS SUBMIT
TING IT TO POPULAR VOTE
UPPER HOUSE OPPOSED
Folkething Voted 62 to 44 in Favor of
Selling the Danish West Indies to
the United States If Popular Vote
Favored the Sale
Copenhagen, Aug. 14, via London,
6.40 p. m. The Folkething, or lower
house of the Danish parliament today
voted in favor of selling the Danish
West Indies to the United States, if
a plebiscite favored the sale. The vote
was 62 for the proposition to 44 against
it, one member being denied a voto
and six being absent.
Having taken this action, the Folke
thing took up the question of ratifi
cation of the treaty itself, providing
for the sale of the islands. The num
ber of votes cast for and against the
treaty was the same as that upon the
first sale.
To Submit to People for Ratification
Discussion in the Folkething turned
upon the question whether the plebis
cite or elections or both the elections
and the plebiscite shall take .place be
fore reaching a settlement of the sale
of the islands. Premier Zahle stated
that if the elections should be neces
sary, the government would have to
ask the American government if the
matter could be postponed till the new
ly elected rigsdag meets in November.
Landsthing Opposed to Sale.
An influential member of the con
servative party in the Landsthing, the
upper house, stated to the Associated
Press that it seems to be settled that
the Landsthing will reject the treaty.
Public meetings on the treaty will be
gin in the Landsthing tomorrow. The
fact that the opposition in the Folke
thing was not in the slightest degree
pacified by the government's proposed
plebiscite the division was the same
as had been predicted two days ago -appears
to justify the prediction that
the Landsthing, where the opposition
is in the majority, will reject the
treaty.
Rejection Would Mean Delay
A rejection would mean a delay of
probably three months in the final
disposition of the islands, since gen
eral elections hardly could be finished
before the end of October and the new
government probably would not get
into harness before the middle of No
vember. Government Ready for Test,
The Associated Press is assured by
the highest sources that the govern
ment at no -time bad nor has the
slightest desire to evade a test of
strength at general elections, but
would greatly regret their becoming
necessary in the, case of the West In
dian islands for two reasons: First,
because of the delay which would thus
be caused, and second, because the
proposed plebiscite woura take the
West Indies question out of politics
avid compel a. decision solely on objec
tive grounds.
Internationa! Party Politics.
As the situation now stands the
whole matter has become one of pure
ly international party politics in which
the disnosition of the islands is all
but lost sight of. The government feels t
that the sale or retention of the is
lands ought not to be made depend
ent in any degree, on international
strife of the various parties, which it
would be if the decision is thrown in
with the varied issues of a general
election. The government is particu
larly anxious to accelerate a decision
as to the fate of the islands because
it feels it is under obligation to the
United States to avoid needless delay
in the matter.
