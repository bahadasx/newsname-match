FOOD SUPPLY ON
BORDER IS SMALL
Movement of Troops to Bor
der To Be Resumed If
Strife Is Averted.
WASHINGTON, D -O. Aug. 15.
Orders for the remaining mo
bilized units of the national
guard to proceed to the border hare
been suspended by the war depart
inen. No official explanation has been
made, but it is known that tne deli
cacy of the railroad strike situation
has been the moTing consideration.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, which would have moved some
23,000 men to the border, should not
be taken as an indication that the
president's negotiations with the rail
road brotherhoods and the railroal
managers have taken an unfavorable
turn, but as a measure of caution, it
was announced.
Fnnsto&'a Mcmbsc
It Is made clear that the suspension
lb not a revocation of the" orders and
that if the railroad strike- situation,
clears up the troops will be moved to
the border. Gen. Funston wired the de
partment as "follows:
"In view of possibility of a general
railroad strike, I desire to call atten
tion of the war department to diffi
culties that will follow in maintaining
food supplies not nly of troops in this
