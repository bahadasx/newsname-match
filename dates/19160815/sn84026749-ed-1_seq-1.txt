D. C. BILL CONFEREES
MAKING PROGRESS
No Signs Yet, However, Of Any
Yielding On Half-and-Half.
Conferees on the District bill are meet
ing again today In an effort to adjust
the many differences between the Senate
bill and the House bill.
oome progress was made yesterday,
though the really difficult proposition
Including the half-and-half, were laid
aside for future consideration.
Opinions differ whether It will be pos
sible to agree on a bill. Neither side thus
far has given any open sign of yielding
on the half-and-half.
In many quarters, there would be a
feeling of satisfaction It the existing
law should be extended. Thla would set
tle the half-and-half question for anoth
er year. Also, It would prevent passage
of the Sterling amendment for a tax on
moneys and credits.

' low Explains Attitude.
"I am going down to the jail to
remain for a week, and when I
get out I will probably ask Major
Pullman for a permit to lecture at
the Public Forum on 'A Week in
Jail.' "
This statement was made today
by Julian Pierce, Socialist lecturer,
as he waited in the cell room of
the Police Court for the wagon
which will convey him to 'the
Washington Asylum and Jail.
Just a few moments previous he
had declined his release on his
own bond after pleading not guilty
to violating the police regulation
prohibiting public speaking without
a permit.
PLEADS "NOT GUILTY."

at Elshth street and Pennsylvania ave

"Not guilty!" when asked bv Deputy
Clark Harper to plead to the offense
charged.
If It would please the court." Pierce
said. "I would l.ke to liave my trial
postponed a week In order to prepare
my case and to emdov counsel."
When asked by Judtre Purrh why a
week was needed to creoro a defense
to a poUloe remilatlon chanre. Mr.
Pierce replied:
"The Socialist party, whloh I reore
sent, believes there are constitutional
questions Involved In this casr. which
affects free speech, and I Mil need
time to assemble all points In mv de

Whlteford Interposed no objection to
this If assured by Pierce that ho would
not repent the offense within tho week.
Declines To Offer Bail.
"I decline to put up collateral or ball
for my release." Pierce said, "and It
Is not likely that while In Jail T could

The court thereupon continued the

The reason for suspending the order
Is a po.-lble shortage of supplies and
difficulty of obtaining transportation for
the men. It has no connecUon. It Is
said, with possible use of the troops
during the threatened strike.
Until further orders are Issued, none
of the organisations preparing to leave

PRINCIPLE ACCEPTED
BY ROAD MANAGERS
Appointment of Special Board Suggested to
Apply Details of Plan, Such as Overtime
and Problems of Similar Character
WILL SEE MEN AT THREE O'CLOCK
President Then Will
Representatives
for Settlement -
Offering to accept the principle of tho shorter workday for their
employes, the railroad managers today in conference with President
Wilson shifted to the shoulders of tho brotherhoods again respond
bility for a strike, if a strike should occur.
The propositon of trie roads, decided upon by the managers after
practically an all-night discussion among them at the New WiUard,
waa 'more or less concrete in form.
It agreed to tho proposal put up to them yesterday by the Preei
dent that they accept the principle of the eight-hour day for their
freight, as well as their passenger service, but countered with the
proposition that detailed questions concerning the application of this
Drinc ble. indud ne such collateral
be appointed by the President.
MEETS MEN AT 3 O'CLOCK.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the President will hold his second con
ference with the brotherhoods. How they will regard the proposal
of the railroads is still to be determined, although heads of the brother-
hoods appeared to regard the outlook as hopeful. A. B. Garretson,
president of the Order of Railway Conductors, expressed satisfaction
over the indications that the managers had shown' a disposition to
make concessions. What these concessions were, or how acceptable
they would be, Mr. Garretson declared he could not say until after
the conference with the President this afternoon.
Secretary to the President Tumulty, acting on instructions from
the President, Issued the following statement after the managers had
left the White House:
The Prealdent apent an hour and a half thla morning with rep
resentatives of the railway management. After the conference he said
that it waa Impossible aa yet to report on the results; all that he could
say was that a very candid and honest discussion was ln progress about
practicable bases of settlement.
TROOP ORDER CAUSES EXCITEMENT.
A flurry of excitement was caused during the time that the Presi
dent was in conference with the managers, when announcement came
from the border that General Funston, on account of the threatened
railroad strike, had recommended a revocation of the order directing
the 25,000 militiamen still at the mobilization camps throughout the
country to proceed to the border.
Later it was announced at the War Department that Funston's
recommendation had been approved, and that it proposed a suspension
of the order pending a determination as to whether there would be
a strike.
The reason given by Oeneral Funston was that a tie-up of the
roads would seriously affect the supply of food for the troops already
on the border.
In some quarters the impression prevailed that General Funston
had been inspired to make the recommendation in view of the pos
sible need for the troops in protecting tho transportation of the mails.
The railroad managers arrived on foot at the White House
promptly at & o'clock. Many of them looked haggard from their all
night session at the hotel. Nevertheless, their attitude was decidedly
more cheerful than it was after their conference with the President
yesterday afternoon. They were received again in the Green Room by
the President.
TRY TO ESCAPE REPORTERS.
When the conference was concluded an effort was made by tho
managers to escape the newspaper men by leaving through tho east
wing of the White House. When surrounded at the east entrance
they refused absolutely to talk. Pressed for a word as to the out
look, Elisha Lee, chairman of the committee, said:
We have assured the President that so long as the situation re
mains in his hands, we shall not give out any Information whatsoever,
and that we shall leave it to him exclusively to make any announce
ments that might be necessary. We shall stick by that agreement.
Mr. Lee would not even say whether he expected the conferences
