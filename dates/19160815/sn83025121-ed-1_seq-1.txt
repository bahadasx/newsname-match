President Confers With Railroad
Managers and Leaders of Bro

ing Differences Quietly Settled
NO GROUND YET FOUND
UPON WHICH TO BEGIN
Basis Upon Which Arbitration
Can Be Had May Lurk In What
Has Been Accomplished But
That Remains To Be Developed
(AseoclsUd press by Federal Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, August " 14.
Business and industrial inter
ruts throughout the country
re wondering if President WiUon can
avert the threatened atrike of 450,000
railroad workers. For two hours and
more the chief executive yesterday
thrashed out the situation with rail
road managers and leaders of the mil
road brotherhoods involved in the
trouble, and at the end of the talking
aid thnt he was unnble to Bay what
the result would be, but would be able
to decide today.
Goes Over Both Sides
In Lis statement following the eon
ference, Mr. Wilson declared that lir
bad 'gojie over the case with both
Ides with the utmost frankness," but
needed time isw which to judge tb
situation whole, and ' whether
there is a possible basil for aa agree
ment. "The foremost questions to be set
tled," added the President, "are what
to arbitrate and how to arbitrate,
l.'ntil we can decide upon that, nothing
much can be dona."
Substantial Bula Reached
It was admitted after the conference
that there appears to be a substantial
basis upon which both aides to the eon
troversy can get together and thrash
out a settlement that will avert the
strike and approximately satisfy all
parties.
While this was the feeling here, des
patches from New York yesterday aft
ernoon said that an announcement was
made there that, should President Wil
son's mediation fail to bring about an
amicable settlement between railroads
and men, a strike will be immediately
declared.
President Has Soma Power
Preparations have been made where
by a complete tie up of l'2!i railroads
in the United states will result. Au
thorities declare that while national
labor laws do not give the President
the right to officially interfere between
employer and employe, police powers
give him autbority to proclaim mar
tial law nrid to place soldiers on trains
to nrevent a complete stoppage of
traffic.
I elision in business circles shows a
realizatii n of the possibility of a na
tional calamity.
Millions Are At Stake
Hundreds of millions would bo lost
to industries should mediation fail, as
well aa enforced idleness of millions of
workingnien in every section of tho
country.
Food privation would be serious in
large communities, it is pointed out;
exports would be suspended; conges
tion of imports on both seaboards,
while thousands of travelers would be
stranded ir tin event of a nation wide
strike such' as the brotherhoods
threaten to bring about.

At Coming Plebiscite
ISLANDERS ANXIOUS
TO IMPROVE STATUS
Germany Said To Be Opposed To
Transfer But European Domi

(Associated rnti by rderl Wlrslsss)
WASHINGTON. Auinst li Kt..n
Htone. chairman of th
tee on foreign relations, announced yes
terday that as soon as the Democratic
caucus has completed the work of rev
enue revision the members will be ask
ed to take up the matter of the Danish
treaty, providing ror the purchase of
the Danish West Jnilies.
Senator Htone nointcd nut liimn nf
the advantages which will accrue to
mis country irom tnp purchase of the
islands from Denmark, and aaserted
that he believes the Tlanieh tvaatiIa tin.
doubtcdly will vote to sell the islands
to me i n i tea states, at the plebiscite,
which tirobablr will be held In that
country to decide the queation.
I
SLANDERS WOULD
L IMPROVE CONDITIONS
The I'nited States was surprised on
July 25, with the announcement that n
treaty arranging for the purchase of the
Danish West Indies, consisting of the
islands of St. John, St. Thomas. St.
Croix and several tiny rocky islets in
the vicinity, was under consideration
and had progressed far enough to give
the exact terms. These were that the
l nited States should pay 25,000,000.
In 18(15 Secretary Heward offered
5,000,000 for the islands and in
Teased the sum to 7.500,000 two
rears later. In 190J the Roosevelt
idoiinistratioi agreed to pay 66.000.-
000, but the .upper Reuse 4 he Dari-
nn rtL'Kdae. refused 4o ratify the ron-
ventioB, which lu( Vn!td tfca-. J
iie oaa rarinea on rebruary 17.
Denmark Mar Accept Lena
Possibly Denmark will eventually be
willing to aoceit less than 25,000,000,
for an influential element in that coun
try is anxious to sell ' the islands.
Moreover, the islanders themselves
apparently wish to improve their eco
nomic condition, and it is highly prob
able that they would vote to plaee
their future in the hands of the
('nited States. They voted in favor
of the transfer fifty years go, and
they have less to lose and more to
gain at this tjme.
It has been aaid at various times
that Germany is opposed to the sale
of the islands, hoping that aome day a
modification of the Monroe Doctrine
would enable her to acquire them for
naval purposes. Whatever truth there
may be in this statement it is certiin
that the I'nited Statea will allow no
foreign power to take control of the
Dnnish West Indies, even though they
are not brought under the American
flag.
European Control Impossible
Thus the hopes of Germany or .my
other power that covets the islands are
(loomed to disappointment.
The Danish West Indies arc not in
trinsicnlly valuable. Their land in
poor, their crops are small, their popu
lation is becoming smaller year by
year; for several yeara their ' revenue
has been decreasing and they have
been a financial burden to Douronrk,
but they lie in a strategic position
with regard to the Atlantic trnde
routes leading to the Panama Canal,
ind for that reason they have a poten
tial value in the scheme of defense
which must be worked out to protect
that great waterway against an eueuiy.
Declares Federation Labor Lead
er Lives On Sweat From
Other Persons' Brows
(Associated Prsss by Federal Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, August 14 Senator
Sherman of Illinois, in the course of
an address before the senate, yester
lay, digressed long enough to attack
Samuel (lompers, president of the Am
erican Federation of Labor, as a "man
who lives on the sweat from other per
sons' brows."
"He is a cheap prostitutor of labor
and he has used the funds he has col
lucted from ignorant persons to defend
he dynamiters of the I.os Angeles
Times building, and in Indianapolis.
All in all his record being considered,
(lompers is fortunate that he himself
managed to escape indictment upon sim
ilar charges," added the senator.
The Illinois solon was speaking on
the shipping bill when he found oppor
tunity to attack the hend of the labor
federation.

NKW YORK, August 14. Health au
thorities who have been lighting in
fantile paralysis yesterday issued a call
for volunteers among the convalescent
victims of the disease, to furnish blood
from which a serum may be made for
the treatment of future cases.
This treatment has been making
gains, in the opinion of medical men
who have been most active in the strug
gle against the disease, and the rapid
improvement of Dr. Leroy Vail, a vie
tiin of the scourge, is considered s
splendid s gn.
The t!. y upon which the use ot
serum made from th- lood of persons,
who have hud the sickness and recov
ered therefrom, is not a new one. The
Rockefeller Institute, under the direc
tion of Dr. Simon Flexner, has been
working along this line with the blood
of inoculated monkeys and other ani

in the number of cases and deaths from
the disease reported during the last

PARIS, August 14. Flinging tbe
British out of hardly-won
trenches north of and east of
Pozieres, the Germans were themselves
flung back bv the Rnai l.il.
their Austrian allies yesterday found
themselves unable to eon with tha
steady advances of the Italians and
Slavs, despite the most stubborn re
sistancea resistance that won the
I raise of their very foes.
Both east and west the lines of
tVrhtlng men ecesawed back and forth.
In the region of te upper Sereth,
south and southwest, of Brody, i Ga
licia, the Russians; , were unable to
forgo forward, buU apparently . very
where else they hare , battejred , away

Teutons Take frlsonara
Berlin claims that south of Brody.
vhere the fighting was terrific all of
Sunday, the Russians were held or
driven hack to their owa linee, leaving
the fields behind them littered with
their dead and wounded men. The
Germans in that sector claim to have
taken three hundred prisoners from
General Brusailoff.
Vienna, in the official Austrian re
pc rts of the day's fighting, says that
the Austrians, southwest of Podka-n-.ien,
"covered the field with the
enemy dead." Klsewhere in that see
tor the Teuton armies continued their
retreat.
The Petrograd account tells of furi
ous struggles all alone the line, and of
the almost unbelievable bravery of the
Russian rroope on the Sereth river
front, where they drove into the fae
of a storm of lead and steel, utterly
oblivious of the death that threatened
them.
Wade River Breast High
One regiment of infantry reached
the little river Tukh, a tributary of
the Sereth river. Thie little stream
had been relied upon to giva the pur
suing Slavs pause. But the Teutons
were mistaken, for the Rusaians plung
ed into the stream and with the water
lapping about their breasts and their
rifles held high above their heads,
wadeil across and drove the enemy from
their carefully prepared positions.
The Zlota Lipa river was also reach
ed yesterday and the advancing Rus
sian armies began their, preparations
for forcing a passage aerose that. At
the confluence of the Deniuv a tiny
tributary of the Zlota Llpa, the Slavs
crossed to the west bank of both tri
butary and the larger stream.
North of the twisting Dneister river
the Russiau offensive continues, and
Petrograd reports "ws are successfully
adv aiming in spite of strong opposi
tion and much stubborn fighting.
Two Villages Captured.
"We have takea the village of
Tustobaby," continued the official
statement issued by the Suasiaa war
office last night, "and have cleared out
of a dense mass of communication
trenches, tbe enemy which had occu
pied them.
"On Sunday afternoon our troops
succeeded in capturing the town of
Zlioroff. Here a cyclist company, ac
companied by armored ears assisted the
infantry troops in the assault.
"In the middle Strlpa region and at
Koropice the pursuing Russians have
reached the north bank of the Dneister,
opposite Mariampol.
hile the Russians have been success
ful in Galicia and Russia, they have
met with reverses elsewhiTe. The Tur
kish official report of the fighting in
the Lake Van region says:
Hiissian troops operating in the Cau
casus have beeu driven back, and in
Persia the Turkish army has also been
suc cessful in pressing back the Invading
hosts from K.MHHitaliAil Th k. ......
