WASHINGTON. Aug. 15. ? After
the committee of railroad managers
had anothor conference with President
Wilson today it becamo known that
I a proposal was under consideration by
H which tho railroads would accept tho
principal of an eight-hour day and
leavo the working out of its appllca
Bilon to tho Inter-state Commerce Com
mission or some body formed for the
-Purpose.
? Tho managers* committee left tho
Whito.House by tho side door. Elisha
Lee, tho chairman, said: "We are en
"tirely In the President's hands and
? have agreed with him that he will
(&makc any statement."
i?&*The railroads are understood to be
tready to concede the principle of an
J eight-hour day providing concessions
he made by the employees so that too
heavy a burden will not be placed upon
[ the railroads.
The men take the stand that tbeyj
i principally want the elpht hour day J
g|on condition that it shall be enforced |
/ whenever possible. The railroads are
Hsaid'to find it impossible to nccept the
I eight hour day unless a workable sys
t tem of application can be built up.
Members of tho mangers committee
I said they had no claims for the future
1 and did not know whether they would
be called to the Whlto House again
The managers took the position that
the eight hour day and the collateral,
issues are inseparable and that It
: would not be practlenblo to accept the I
i eight hour day and leave the othor
1 questions to arbitration. Tho issues
aTe interwoven they contend and must!
be decided together. It was probable (
, one of the officials said, that if such
? proposition were submitted to them
,by the president today that they would j
I return to New York and place it be- i
fore tho general board.

II ni CASE
61SIE MOT
Application for Rehearing in
Supreme Court of West
Virginia Refused.
Local attorneys who nro endeavor
ing to have the new Fairmont Charter
go into effect received notice today
that the application for a rehearing
of this case before th? Supreme Court
of West Virginia hail been refused at
the Special session. This is another
victorv for the Fairmont Republican
committee who are parties to the suit
| and in whose favor the suit has now
been decided in the state courts.
Tho application for rehearing was
made by tho local Democratic attor
neys who represent the present city
officials in their fight to hold their
jobs, early in July shortly after this
same court had finally after examin
ation of the transcript of the case
decided in favor of the local Repub
lican committee.
As the cas0 now stands it is finish
ed and finally adjudicated so far as
the court of West Virginia are con
cerned. An application for another
injunction against the city officials
rostraining them from placing the new
charter in effect is now before the
Federal Court of tho Northern West
Virginia district, on practically tho
same grounds that the bill in the state
courts contained. The next regular
session of this court is at Martins
burg on the third Tuesday of Septem
ber. Judge Dayton of this court has
so far refused to consider this appli
cation until the matter was out of tho
state courts. Now that the state
courts have finished it is up to Judge
Dayton. Tho attorneys of the Repub
lican committee are confident, that!
Judge Dayton will not reverse the de-i
cision of the state court.
In case Dayton refuses to grant tho j
injunction the Democratic attorneys!
can take the mattor before the United
State Fourth. Circuit Appellate court.)
From this court It would go to the Su-1
preme Court of the United States, it i
is not likely, however, that any fur- j
ther attempt to delay the new 'Char
ter will be made if Judge Dayton de-1
cides against the injunction. j

WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.?Orders
for the remaining mobilized units of
national guards to proceed to border
have been suspended by the depart
ment. No official explanation lias
been made but it is known that the
delicacy of the railroad strike situa
tion has been the moving considera
tion.
The suspension of the order which
would have moved 25,000 men to the
border should not be taken as nn in
4Ve*tion that the President's negotia
tions with the railroad brotherhood
and the railroad managers has taken
an unfavorable turn but is a measure
of caution.
it is considered highly undesirable
that all the remaining guardsmen
should be moved to the border while
there pas a possiblity of a strlko in
which they might bo called ppo5?
preserve order.
There is oven the possiblity ^
some of the trooptf might be ctUiigl
upon to guard or operate mail trains j
and trains supplying troops alr<
on the border. '?'^SjLai
The suspension of the order pr<
vents immediate movement of troop
from Kentucky, Ohio and Vermontlaild

troops which were to have gone for*

It is clear that the suspension!'
not n revokatlon of the order anal
the railroad strike situation clears n.
troops will he moved to the bordei
line. The official explanation
change is that difficulty of trahmor
tation and equipment suddenly- def "
oped and made a delay neceaaar J
is known, however, that the rail
situation is the real cause.
