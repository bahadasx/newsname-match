A badger was captured in the Mc
Cabe building Sunday evening where
it had been chased by "boys. This Is
supposed to have been the animal that
Harry Porter brought to town a year
ago, and which escaped from captivi
ty the following night. Porter was
out in the country and attacked the
fcabger and had., presumably, killed
it. Ho' tied it on the side of the car
and upon arrival home was surprised
to And it very much alive. Ho tied ft
up with a piece of wire, but it man
aged to escape during the night and
has since been prowling around town
getting its living as best it could.
