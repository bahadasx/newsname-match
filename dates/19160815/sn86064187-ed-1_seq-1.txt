60 PERCENT OF
EGGS COMING TO
MARKET ARE BAD
Vast Sum of Money Lost to
Farmers and Shippers
of Produce.
Thousands of dollars have been lost
during each of the summer months by
farmers and poultrymen through rare
lessness in handling eggs. Impiirv
this morning at the local Swift and
company produce house diselosed the
fflct that shippers to them lost
i... .i . ' . . '
last mouth through spoiled eeirs sent
to the local market.
Six hundred and fiftv four cases of!
spoiled eggs were sent to the dump in"
July. In one dav seventy-five cases
were refused. The worst week in
the history of the bscal plant resulted
in the refusal of (A percent of eggs
container) in 287 cases. The spoiled
eggs during the past month have been
more than ) percent of the total sup j
Candling Work. :
Mot of the eggs sent to the bv! I
market have been either not candled
at all or a poor light has been used
In one rase of eggs sent in a few
weeks ago there were three live chick
ens within the shells. The shipping
produce man declared the eggs were
forwarded the same day they were re
ceived. ."We buy eggs on a candled basis
and they must he good when we get
them." said A. H. Brooks, manager of
the local produce house. "F.ggs arc
worth easily from $5 40 to $5.70 a case,
so it is easy to figure out that this
loss falls heavily on farmers and pool
try men. Naturally, we cannot pay for
rotten or broken eggs, but it is possi
ble for the poultry raisers of this nart
of the country to save many dollars
every week if they will only use a lit
tle more care.
Spoil In Two Days.
"With weather conditions as they are
now. an egg will spoil in forty-eight
hours if it is not stored in a tooi
place and I would suggest that eggs
be gathered early and marketed fre
quently. . N
"Many rountry people seem to have
th practice of gathering eftrs late in
.... i ,
y -ann men leaving tnem in a
shed or some other hot place and mar
keting them at irregular intervals. The
inevitable result of this is that when
the eggs are suhmitted to the candling
test a big percentage are absolutely
worthless. If the farmers would ap
ply as much care in the handling of
eggs as they do in their farm work,
they would find themselves many dol
lars ahead when thev figure up their
profits for the yeaj"
