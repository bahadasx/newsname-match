SAD DEATH OF MISS
LIUjAM ACKLEY
i". /i Diej Saturday Afternoon at the
-r
Home of Her Parents in
I
a
Liberty Township.
Lillian Ackley, the sixteen year
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward
Ackley, pioneer and well known citl
zens of Hamilton county, died at the

Saturday afternoon, after two weeks
of severe Buffering.
& Miss Ackley had been in poor
health Borne time and two weeks ago
was stricken with brain fever, which
developed Into spinal meningitis, re
*. suiting in lier death Saturday after
noon. She was a patient sufferer to
'the end, which came as a relief to
the family and friends who had been
.-'at her beside and witnessed the or
deals through which she passed. She
was a loving, kind and dutiful
.daughter and her untimely taking
off is a crushing blow to her fond
parents and brothers and sisters.
The heartfelt sympathy of the com
munity where the Ackleys have liv
ed so long goes out to them in the
hour of their bereavement and they
have the consolation of knowing
rthat the thought and good will of a
-wide circle of friends are with them
now. Besides the parents, two broth
ers—Paul ^nd Ferridoon, both liv
ing at home, and four sisters, Miss
Lucretia Ackley of Hampton, Mrs.
Bedsaul and Mrs. Nellie Bean, both
of South Dakota, and little Sybil,
living at home—are left to mourn
her death.
The funeral was held from the
home yesterday forenoon at 10
o'clock, with interment In the Llber
Hity Center cemetery.
DALL YOUNG LIBRARY
I'eople of Ellsworth Considering
Matter of Taking Advantage of
Privileges Offered.
Ellsworth News: This city is
well supplied with all the "accessor
ies" of the average small town, but
there is one thing that we need, one
that would add greatly to the social
life of the town. That one need of
Ellsworth Js a public library. And
there is a very easy way to get this
library. At Webster City Is located
tho Kendall Young library. This is
an endowed library and as the en
dowment has increased materially
since it was bestowed, they now
have besides the handsome building
and their large and varied assort
ment of books, a surplus)fund of ov
er $300,000. To give the people of
Hamilton county, outside of Web
ster City, the benefit of this gift,
they have volunteered to install a
free public library in any small town
or community where some reliable
person will take the responsibility of
caring' for tho books that Is check
ing them out and in, and seeing that
the flues are collected for overdue
or damaged hooks. The express or
freight charges from and to Webster
City would have to be paid also, but
this would be a merely nominal sum.
Last winter before the present
owner took possession of the News
there was more or less discussion in
regard to this branch library. At
that time the town of Williams made
arrangements for one of these lib
raries, and it was installed about
March 1st. The Kendall Young lib
rary sent an assortment of seventy
live or one hundred books, expect
ing to exchange them for another
supply in about six weeks. At this
time Williams still has the original
assortment and even now, after
fcbout five months, they do not want
to part with them, as everybody
•wants to read all of them. At Wil
liams a small library board was ap
pointed to take charge of affairs and
this has proved very satisfactory at
that place and should prove the
same here.
The worth of a good library can
not be over-estimated, and we would
like to see one established here, be
cause the benefits that would accrue
•'from even the presence of a small
*Jlibrary in our city would he lasting
**«nd immeasurable.

SOME BIG DRAINAGE
PLANSJDER WAY
Hamilton County is on a Ditch That
is to Cost More Than
$200,000.
Fort Dodge Chronicle: Webster
county is contemplating the con
struction of drainage ditches which
will cost in the vicinity of $430,000.
This sum will be expended on four
ditches in the county this fall and
early next summer.
The greatest deal in drainage
work will be a joint ditch between
Hamilton, Green and Webster coun
ty which will be built in Gowrie
township. The ditch will cost $209,
218. The county board of supervis
ors will confer with the boards from
the other counties on Tuesday at
which time bids will be opened on
the proposed project.
A second drainage ditch will be
constructed in Gowrie township by
Green and Webster counties and will
cost in the vicinity of $100,000.
In addition to these ditches which
will be constructed by the neigh
boring counties a ditch will be con
structed in Hardin township at a
cost of $65,000 and another ditch
will be built on the Boone county
lime at at cost of $53,000.
AUTOMOBILE DIMMERS
COST IfERY LITTLE
Every Auto Owner Should Adopt the
"Safety First" Motto and Have
.A.-jOv"\Safe Lights.
•. "V.1
There are approximately 500 au
tomobiles in Webster City. These,
with the thousands of others owned
by farmers of the surrounding coun
try and citizens of adjoining towns
who are almost daily visitors here,
are driving every night through the
streets of the city with blinding
headlights, often placing the lives of
other drivers and of pedestrians in
extreme danger.
It is a well known fact that when
two cars, both having glaring lamps,
meet, both drivers arc momentarily
so blinded by the dazzling light that,
they arc unable to make out the out
lines of the other machine or even
to see the road. So the careful driv
er must slow down and barely crawl
past the other car, while the reck
less driver whirls rapidly past, trust
ing to a fool's luck.
There is no sufficent reason why
this condition should be permitted (o
exist. Some automobile owners plead
the extra cost of dimmers as au ex
cuse for risking the lives of other
people. But the facts prove even
this argument fallacious.
The ordinary 15 or IX candle
power bulb that is used in most cars
costs 35 cents. A frosted bulb of the
same power, so protected that the
bright light is deflected to the
ground, and that which projects
ahead is diffused into a soft glow,
costs 45 cents. This is an increase
of 10 cents for safety. But automo
bile dealers state that most drivers
instead of buying either one of these
bulbs are paying 75 cents for a 30
candle power light, charged with hy
drogen gas, instead of being a vacu
um, as is tho case with the ordinary
bulb, and manufactured for the spec
ial purpose of casting a bright, glar
ng light.
Expense then is not so essential
an item with many automobile own
ers, but instead of undergoing this
extra expense to insure greater safe
ty, they are going to the other and
dangerous extreme of buying bright
er lamps, whle project a still more
blinding light and make our thor
oughfares more perilous.
There are many different kinds of
dimmers, nearly all of which can be
secured cheaply. Protected bulbs
can be purchased, the lenses can he
painted, or special lenses secured.
The special kind of dimmers is not
so important—but the all essential
thing is that some kind should be
obtained and constantly used.
Many cities have ordinances re
quiring the lights of ail automobiles
to be reasonably dimmed.

ASKING FOR A FRAN
E
i(r.
The Iowa Falls Electric Company
Wants to Furnish Electricity
to That Town.
On the fifteenth of the present
month the people of Kamrar will
vote upon a proposition to grant a
franchise for twenty-five years to
ill Iowa Falls Electric company ,for
file iVrfvilcge of using the"streets and
alleys of the town. Prices named in
the franchise are similar to those
named in the franchise recently
granted at Blairsburg, the maximum
price being 15 cents per kilo
watts. The people of Kamrar, in
tliq .judgment of the Frceman-Trib
unc, could do better by getting their
electricity of this city. Of course it
will cost them something to build
the lines, but the proflts from the
business would pay this ex
pense. Moreover, the business
would be in the hands of the people
of Kamrar and they could make such
rates as they deemed best. They
could furnish electricity at much
less than the Iowa Falls company of
fers it and in the end they would
be better satisfied.
City Manager Vollmer was recent
ly down to see the council in regard
to furnishing electricity from this
city, hut the council offered no en
couragement, apparently thinking
that tho people of Kamrar did not
want to take advantage of the bet
ter proposition offered by this city.
It is likely that the franchise will
carry by a very large majority, be
cause the people want the service,
regardless of price, and they want
it now.

NO SERIOUS SHORT
AGE IN WHEAT CROP
Washington. Officials Say We Have
Large Surplus on Hand—No
Cause to Worry.
Washington, Aug. 12.—The de
partment of agriculture reports that
there will be no serious shortage in
the wheat crop and the federal trade
commission guarantees there will be
no unwarranted raise in the price of
flour. Experts of -government de
partments thus united today in say
ing that there is no need to fear be
cause of the small wheat crop ex
pected this year. Even if there were
a serious s.iortagc, if not a bushel of
wheat was harvested, this nation
would live, as one official said, "on
the fat of the land." There is a
shortage in the Dakotas and some
farmers will suffer, but upon the
whole the ci^op will be reasonably
large and all domestic demands can
be supplied.
Two government departments said
they are ready to meet any manipu
lation of wheat or flour—the depart
ment of justice and the federal trade
commission.
Congress also probably would be
involved, as in the present gasoline
investigation.
"If we find evidence of unfair
methods and price boosting cither
by complaint to us ok hy^jur own in
formation, we shall get busy" said
Commissioner Davies cf the federal
trade commission.
"The wheat crop this year is ex
pected to be 654,000,000 bushels. On
the basis of 5.3 bushel per capita a
year—the average consumption—
with 75.00l,000 bushels required for
seed, the requirement would be
about 020,000,000 bushels. This
would leave 34,000,000 bushels for
export.
Last year the crop was a record
one 1.012,000,000 bushels. About
258,000,000 bushels were exported.
The year before about 333.000,000
bushels went abroad, but the five
year average is only 123,000,000
bushels.

EXAMI
NORMAL TRMNMG
Superintendent Snow Announces
Examination on August 23, 24
and 25.
A teachers' examination is to be
held Aug. 23, 24, 25, according to
announcement made by County Su
perintendent E. F. Snow.
This examination is given for
those who have had tho required
work in normal training. It is not
possible to ascertain at this time the
number of candidates who will take
this examination, but it is thought
there will not be many who will take
it.
This makes the second year that a
regular examination has been given
in August. It was at one time the
custom to give a special examination
at this time if it was necessary to
do so in order to sccure a sufficient
number of teachers for the schools
of a county. The last session of the
legislature made it necessary for can
didates for teachers certificates to
have twelve weeks of normal train
ing. A number of the young peo
ple take the summer work in col
leges and do not complete the work
until after the July examination. In
order that these people can take the
examination the State Department
of Education now gives a regular
examination each August.

Mrs. Lilly Farrif and L. A. Hallo-
well in Culmination of
Youthful Romance.
You may as well try to beat a
mortgage as to deprive Love Artist
Cupid of the victims at whom he
shoots his love-tipped arrows. It
may take years for him to accomp
lish his purpose but lie seldom fails
in his undertakings.
Years ago in Illinois a boy and a
girl were sweethearts and gave to
each the tender affection that is
known only to youth. But as time
went on the boy married another
girl and she became the wife of an
other man. The death angel camc
and claimed the mates of the couple
who had loved in earlier days. The
youthful romance came to a culmin
ation here Saturday afternoon when
L. A. Hallowell and Mrs. Lilly Farrif
were united in marriage in the coun
ty clerk's office, the Rev. Arthur
Metcalf, pastor of the Congregation
al church, saying the words that
made them man and wife.
Mr. Hallowell is a contractor and
lives at Alta, Iowa. Mrs. Farrif re
sided at Louisville, Illinois. She has
been in the city the past few days
visiting at the home of her daugh

STRUCK BY FAILURE
OF THEIRWHEAT CROP
Webster City People Directly Af­
fected by Almost Total Loss of
This Grain.
Several Webster City residents
owning farms in the Dakotas and
former residents who have gone to
that part of the United States, are
directly affected by the terrible rust
which has struck the wheat of the
Dakotas.
One man who owns a farm upon
which there were this season 75
acres of wheat, which usually aver
ages 25 bushels to the acre, this
week received a letter from his rent
er who earlier in the season was ju
bilant over the wheat prospect. The
letter stated that after heavy rains,
there came four days of hot winds,
effectually rusting the stand of
wheat which will nom amount to
perhaps 7 bushels to the acre.
Another family whose son is upon
a farm near Newark, received word
that the wheat cannot be harvested
at all upon his farm. The heavy
rains this season have been unpre
cedented in that section and the
fields at the harvest season are like
swamps.
Iowa is not so bad, after all, this
year. Few farmers will lose all their
crop on account of the drouth. A
few suffered on account of hail
storms, but an Iowa farmer usually
has a crop of something to market.

FORT DODGE Ml
KOMEJROM WAR
Had Some Unpleasant Experiences
in the Italian Army—Secured
a Discharge.
Fort Dodge, Aug. 14.—After sev-:
en months of actual service on one
of the most active fronts in the Eur
opean war, three months In a mili
tary hospital *ind a month of bitter,f
trials and hardships in making an
escape, Edward Paltani, late in the
Italian army, returned to Fort Dodge,
this morning after nearly a year's
absence.
It was just about a year ago that
Paltani left here to go to Italy.
There he enlisted in the army. He
did trench duty at Gorizia, the scene
of one of the biggest drives of the
war. It was while doing trench duty
that Paltani was overcome by pois
onous gases.He was removed to a hos
pital where after nearly three
months he was released. Weakened,
however, by his service and the hard
ships of the trenches, he was no
longer of any use to the government,
and was given his discharge. That
was a little more than a month ago.
It toolc him about a month to get
out of Italy, he says.
"An American passport isn't
worth anything," said the late Ital
ian soldier. "I got out by getting
my lieutenant-general to counter-'
sign a passport by having the offic
ial Italian seal. Those officers over
there are mostly ignorant, can't ev
en read and write. I just showed
them the passport with the seal and
they let me through."
Paltani reached New York three
days ago on a cattle boat. He says if
he intends to go to work, fto more
war for him, he says.
