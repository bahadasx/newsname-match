KENTUCKY TROOPS WILL
nn to tuc nnoncD'
. All tho Nationnl Guard units in
cluded in Pro3idcnt Wilson's rail on
Juno 18, not yqt on tho Mexican
border, were ordered there Satur
day by the War Department. Be
tween 20,000 nnd 25,000 additional
troops will thus be added to the
border force there. National Guard
forces on tho border will number
about 123,000 nnd the total of all
troops on tho border or in Mexico
will be 175,000. Secretary Baker
made a formal announcement that
the troops' movement hnd nothing
whatever to do with tho Mexican
situation, and was solely to relievo
thousands of troops now held in
mobilization camps, only becnuo of
tho lack of n few recruits to bring
units up to minimum pence strength.
Saturday's orders will send the
troops from Kentucky, Ohio nnd
Vermont to the border nSj soon as
transportation can bo arranged for
them and will move all the others
as soon as they are properly
equipped. War Department officials
decided on their action because the
troops are restivo in camp and
there seems to be no stimulant to
recruiting while thcro was no pros
pect of movement to the border.
They now expect most of the regi
ments will be filled before the
troops leave.
The Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont
troops, which will move practically
at once, will add the following units
to the long border line:.
Kentucky One brigade of three
regiments of infantry, one company
signal corps, one field hospital and
one nmbulnnce company, mobilized
at Fort Thomas.
Ohio-yTwo brigade.3 of three regi
ments each of infantry, one squad-
ron cavalry, one battalion field ar
tillery, onb battalion engineers, one
battalion signal corps, three field
hospital corps, two ambulance com
panies, all mobilized at Columbus.
Vermont One regiment infantry,
and one squadron cavalry,' mobilized
at' Colchester.

EVERYBODY WELL PLEASED
Tho first "Dollar Day" held by
the merchants of Mt. Sterling made
a big hit with tho buying public nnd
the merchants were more than

joyed in many a day. Suchs values
as were offered wero bound to draw
a crowd; as in many instances

and it goes without snying that
bargain hunters will eagerly await
the "Dollar Day" sales, which
will be bfid the second Saturday in

tivebnrgnins than his competitors,
the public is sure to get a run for
