A JAPANESE CUTS
TH
Sometime Sunday night Saka,
Japanese, 'employed o n Kekalia
ditch, cut his throat with a razor in
his cottage near Camp 4, Kekahn
ditch, and died.
Deputy Sheriff Crowell was noti
fied early Monday morning and he
and Dr. Lyman went to the scene.
They found the man dead in the
yard just outside the door of the
house. Blood on the lloor and steps
indicated that the cutting had been
done inside.
No reason is known for the deed

drinker. It is related that he cut
his throat once before, about live,
years ago, in an attempt to commit
suicide, but was saved by Dr. West.
The man lived alone.

MAT AND DIES
DR. KAWAGUGHI TO
BIG TAX APPEAL
GASES DEGIDED
The Tax Appeal Court for the
County of Kauai, consisting of Ciias.
S. Dole, chairman; E. H.W. Broad
bent, and J. H. Moragne, filed on
Saturday its decisions in .the three
eases it has had under consideration
for the past month, viz: In the ap
peals of Hawaiian Sugar Company,
Ltd., Gay & Robinson (as to the
property leased to the Hawaiian
Sugar Company), and McBryde
Sugar Company, Ltd.
In the case of the Hawaiian Sugar
Company, commonly known asMa
kaweli Plantation, the Court decid
ed that the contentions of the plan
tation are correct, that the assess
ment of $4,500,000 is too high, and
hat the valuation returned on the
property of 84,250,000 is a fail
valuation, for the reason, mainly,
that the property of the plantation
is all on leased land, the whole
property, including the mill, to re
vert to the lessors, Gay & Robinson,
at the end of the present lease, in
l!K)i).
Besides this, the Government
land which the plantation leases,
(about twelve hundred acres of
cane land bordering on Uanapepe
Yaliey) will go back to the Govern
ment by the end of next year, and
the prospect is that it will not lie
released to the Company, but will
undoubtedly be opened up for home
steads. This piece contains nearly
one-six of the available cane land
of the plantation.
The Gay it Robinson holdings
leased to the plantation (the lessors'
interest in the same) are assessed at
$800,000, the figure put upon it by
Assessor Farley, which is a raise of
$1500,000 on the return, and is sus
tained. In this case the Court was
evidently influenced by the fact
that the property in question will
be constantly gaining in value, to
the same extent that the property
of the Hawaiian Sugar Company is
lapsing, and for the same reason.
The taxes on these lands, by the
terms of the lease from Gay &
Robinson, are paid by the planta
tion. McBryde Sugar Co. was returned
at $2,000,000, and assessed at $:$,
000,000, and the Court has "split
the difference" and put the valua
tion at $2,500,000.
Renovating Grass House
Mr. William Hyde Rice is re
thatching his grass house. This is
probably about the only real Ha
waiian grass house on the island
certainly by all odds the most com
plete and palatial one and as a

ought to be preserved, and it is a
matter of public interest and public
pride, that it is being "restored."

Neighborhood
Twenty-one Honolulu boys arriv
ed on the Kinau Wednesday morn
ing to spend two weeks camping on

on the maps at school.

IN FLORAL PARADE
D. Howard Hitchcock, the artist,
who was recently on Kauai, will in
terest himself in the proposed diora
ma of Waimea canyon which it is
proposed shall be used in the com
ingfloral parade. Lionel Walden is
also cooperating in the matter, un
der the guidance of Alexander Hume
Ford of the Pan-Pacific Club. Mr.
Ford is planning to have the schools
of Honolulu make the float as a
part of their manual training work,
which should lessen the expense
considerably.
This float section in the coming
carnival will be the bigge.-t thing
ever attempted. One principal ob
ject of it will be to bring before tin;
public, by means j f dioramas,
scenes of striking grandeur or beau
ty all over the Islands: and Waimea
canyon has been selected for this
purpose on Kauai. The diorama
will be exhibited at the Pan-Pacific
Club rooms and after the floral par
ado the structure of the float will
be perserved for future use.
The gentlemen working on the
proposition at Honolulu will require
$500. which will cover all expenses
of their artists coming up, making
and exploiting the diorama and
finally undressing and storing it for
future use.
The following extract from let
ter just received will furtherexplain
the matter:
"We are just beginning the build
ing of the bodiis of some of our
floats, so that the advanced school
boys may see just what is expected
of them before they get to work.
Of course we are engaging a scenic
painter for putting in any back
ground, etc. to the diorama section,
under the supervision of Messrs.
Walden and Hitchcock The object
of the Pan-Pacific Club is to secure
about one hundred floats, thelwdies
of which, at least, will he perma
nent structures that may be re-decorated
every year, with nothing to
re-build but the superstructure."

WAIMEA CANYON
THE BROWN GASE
BEFORE THE BOARD
The Honolulu Star-Bulletin of
yesterday afternoon contained tl e
following concerning the hearing in
Ihe Brown case:
Declaring that he has not yet
been officially notified of the action
of the school commission in not re
appointing him or his wife as prin
cipal and teacher, respectively, at
the Waimea, Kauai, school, II. C.
Brown appeared before the board
today and told his side of the story.
The Browns were represented by
Attorney Patterson of Lihue. He
said that, taking all things into
consideration, t h e only charge
against the Browns appeared to be
"wilful in subordination" in that
they had failed to advance pupils
from one grade to another.
"Is that true, Mr. Kinney?" he
asked the superintendent of public
instruction.
"You are not examining me, Mr.
Patterson, you are examining Mr.
Brown," Kinney replied.
Quoting from a letter written by
Kinney, Attorney Patterson added
that another charge was that Mrs.
Brown had been too prominent in
the administration of the Waimea
school; that the Browns quarreled
before the pupils, and that Mrs.
Brown "completely controls Mr.
Brown in all his actions."
Brown told how he and his wif
had taken charge of the Waimea
school five years ago
"At that time it was run down
and the discipline was poor," he
said- "We promoted 75 pupils to
get things going. I believe, that in
every way the school has made cred
itable progress.
"We were never notified that our
work was unsatisfactory. In failing
to advance certain pupils we thought
that we were acting in accordance
with the rules of the department."
Letters were placed on file writ
ten by teachers at the Waimea
school and commending the work
of Mr. and Mrs. Brown. One said:
"Mrs. Brown has a kind heart and
is willing to help the children and
teachers." Brown told of the cir
culation of a petition in the school
which was signed by 1(!0 pupils who
asked that the Browns bo retained.
Brown also declared that Deputy
Sheriff W. O. Crowell had tried to
stop other petitions gotten up by
the people in the neighborhood.
The Browns and Crowell had had
some trouble over two carpenters
working on the school premises, one
alfeged to have been related to Crow
Hj Brown testified.
'Any statement that Mrs. Brown
and myself quarreled before the pu
pils and teachers is untrue," Brown
continued." "Mrs. Brown does not
dominate me I deny that charge.
If there are disputes over school
work, they are settled by me. I
don't claim, however, that I do
everything. As I told you, there
was team work at that school. Mrs.
Brown has never directed me how
to carry on the work."
Brown added that the work at
the Waimea school has been com
mended by the Inspector George S.
Raymond a n d by Commissioner
Eric Knudscn.
During a conference which Brown
hail with Commissioner Knudsen
regarding the 1 ward's actfon in not
reappointing the Browns, Brown
said he was told by Knudsen that
"the lioard is a solid wall of opposi
tion againsr you; youareoiA of har
mony with the board."
(Later in the afternoon the com
missioners decided adversely to Mr.
and Mrs. Brown.)
