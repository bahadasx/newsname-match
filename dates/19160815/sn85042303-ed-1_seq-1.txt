FOLLOWING CONFERENCE BETWEEN RAILROAD MAN
AGERS AND PRESIDENT WILSON, THIS REPORT BE
CAME CURRENT IN WASHINGTON TODAY.
Railroads fcre Said to be Read- Concede Eight-Hour Day to
theBrotherhoods, Leaving 'ting Out of its Application
to the Interstate Commerce -mission or Some Body to
be Formed for that Purpose- 'roads Said to be Ready
to Concede this Principle to w len if they will Make
Concessions so as Not to Put t 'eavy a Burden upon
the Railroads Outlook for Peav 'e Settlement of the
Differences Becoming More Hop d since Wilson Has
Taken Charge of the Situation.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 15.
After the committee of rail
road managers had held an--other
conference with Presi
dent Wilson today, it became
known that a proposal was
under consideration by which
the railroads would accept the
principle of the eight-hour day
for the brotherhoods, leaving
the working out of its applica
tion to the interstate commerce
commission or some body to be
formed for that purpose.
The railroads are under
stood to be ready to concede
the principle of the eight-hour
day providing the employes
will make a concession so as
not to put too heavy a burden
on the railroads.
The outlook is much more
hopeful for a peaceful settle
ment of the differences be
tween the railroads and the
brotherhoods since President
'Wilson has taken over the
work of bringing about a set
tlement of the troubles and
averting a nation-wide strike.
COMMITTEE FROM THE BUSINESS
MENS ASSOCIATION APPOINTED
THIS MORNING -TO PREPARE
AND CIRCULATE PETITIONS.
The directors of the business mens
association met this morning and ap
pointed a committee to prepare and
circulate petitions asking the board
of county comissioncrs to call a spec-
lal election for the purpose of voting
bonds for road purposes.
The committee is composed of
Ceorge Henley, I. M. Tutnam and C.
E. Itinger and they went to work Im
mediately on the proposition in or
der to have the petitions ready to pre
sent to the board at their next regu
lar meeting.
The commissioners have stated all
the time that the only thing they de
sired was a petition rrom the taxpay
ers asking for this election and they
would call it, otherwise they would
defer it until the regular election in
November when they would authorize
It without a petition. It costs $750
to hold an election In this county anc
the commissioners desire that they
be petitioned before they spend thit )
money.
"My troubles are driving rue tr
drink." said a citiren. "I wish yoi
would lend them to me, then" said hi:
friend around the corner.

FEAR OF BIG RAILROAD STRIKE
CAUSES REVOKING OF ORDER
FOR MORE GUARDSMEN.
OF P
War Department Officials Fear That
Strike of the Railroad Men Would
Seriously Hamper the Food Supply
At Mexican Border. ,
San Antonio, Tex., Aug. 15. The
order for twenty-five thousand more
guardsmen to proceed to the border
has been revoked, according to an
announcement at Funstoji's headquar
ters here today.
The war department lias notified
him that "the troops would continue to
be held in the state mobilization
camps. It was understood that the
delicacy of the railroad strike situa
tion was the moving consideration.
deneral Funston recommended that
the troops not be sent as a cousuni
mation of the threatened railroad
strike might hamper the food supply
on the border. This developed the
fact that estimates given the civilian
population of the border flour for on
ly one week ahead and the army but
little more.
THE DOME QUESTION
COMES UP AGAIN
Oklahoma City, Aug 14. Strong ef
Torts will be made at the next session
of the legislature to put through an
appropriation to build a lofty dome
on the state capitol. Dr. Joe Clark,
I . 1.1 ...... M Tnltmann nmintv
ass,u'J"w" 1,"um -"" -w.
declared yesteruay. iKtcior
takes issue with Stephen Douglas,
member of the capitol commission,
who stated recently that a dome was
not wanted and that it would be too
expensive.
"There will be a fight in the next
legislature to have a dome put on the
building." Dr. Clark isaid. "With
out a dome the building looks like a
hospital. 1 know the people of my
county would be willing to subscribe
a dome fund if the legislature re
fuses to make the appropriation.
. Cost Overestimated.
"Mr Douglas, In a recent statement,
declared it would cost $250,000 to put
a dome on the capitol. Being a
member of the commission, he knew
that the Stewart Construction com
pany made a price of $149,000 for a
high dome complete. I can't Imagine
the state house without a dome. It
wouldn't look right. tSvery capitol
built within the last thirty years has
had a dome. They are all patterned
after the national capitol.
Mere Trifle to Taxpayers. f
"The amount it would cost, r pre?
ented ia figures on a state levy
amounts to less than one-tenth of T
mile, or 10 cents oa the $1,000 valua
ion. I took the trouble to inveU
pate and I found the last legis'atur
at least 93 percent in favor of th
I dome."
S-en:s that some national lrgis'
crs would rather fork up a large I
ninity than vote enough money fi
a big mvy.

SECRETARY OF CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE SAYS THAT MER
CHANTS WILL NOT BE ASKED
TO CONTRIBUTE TO ROAD FUND
The secretary of the chamber of
commerce stated this morning that in
the future the chamber of commerce
would not act as a collecting agency
to secure funds for road working pur
poses for the reason that the gross
production tax on oil in this county
will be sufficient to take care of the
road work in the county in the fu
ture, used In connection with the reg
ular levy for road and bridge pur
poses. Some time ago it was proposed that
two days be set aside for road working
purposes and the road overseers
H F
In
every prccinci in me county weie
given instructions to meet and warn
every one In their neighborhood to be
at certain points. The continued dry
spell, however, put a stop to all these
plans, and the road working days have
been abandoned so far as the chamber
of commerce is concerned. Secretary
West stated this morning that the
road to McMillan leading to the Mar
shall county line, was In good condi
tion with the exception of a mile
near Smyrna cemetery which could
be repaired at little cost. A delega
tion of citizens were In the city ask

I The county recently received from
the gross production tax on oil $14,-
8515.00, one-half of which will be used
for road purposes. This Is but one of
many payments which will be received j

for this reason he (s not going to ask
the business men of this city to put
up more money for road purposes.

COUNTY COMMI9IONERS WANT
THE COMMITTEE FROM CHAM
BER Of COMMERCE TO PRE
PARE AND PRESENT PETITIONS
Unless the committee recently ap
pointed by the chamber of commerce
to prepare and present a petition to
the board of county commissioners
asking that they call an election for
voting on the question of issuing
bonds for road purposes Is forthcom
ing, the board will not authorize tho
election.
Such is practically the statement of
the entire 1oard this morning. Some
time ago this committee was formed
for the purpose above set forth, but
up to date nothing has been accom
plished. The board is a unit for the
bonds but want tho people to help
bear any censure that might be im
posed by those who oppose bond Is
sues on general principals.
Revenues for road purposes from
every source In this county this year
will be entirely Inadequate to build
a system of permanent roads, and un
less a bond issue Is authorized and
carries the chances for a permanent
highway system the coming year is
anything but flattering.
At the present time the county can
only vote bonds in the sum of $125,
000 which many contend will not be
gin to give us the road system to
which the county is entitled, it is all
the county commissioners can do
however, and this amount together
with other revenues rrom the gross
production tax and the regular levy
would give approximately $223,000 for
road purposes. The commissioners
are anxious to take some action in
this matter but they have checked It
up to the committee to see what they
intend doing about It.
If this amount was voted as abova
set forth and then the county was
to secure government aid as it U
claimed It can if all plans and speci
fications are complied with it would
then give the county $t50,000 provi
ded the above figures are correctly
estimated as the government proposes
to put up a dollar lor permanent
roads every time a county w ill do so.
Commissioner G. W. Yomig stated
this morning that he was in favor of
deferring the election until the gen
eral election In November as it will
cost $750.00 to hold a special elec
tion, and h further stated that he
thought the bond question would have
a better chance to carry If voted up
m at the regular election than it
would have at a special eleVtion.
However he stated that if the peo
ple wanted a special election all they
'iad to do was to petition and the
hoard would call it. If they wait until
I November however a petition w ill
not be necessary and he states that
'the board will call for it anyhow.
