New York, Aug. 14. A genera1
strike on virtually all the railroads of
the nation, paralyzing commerce and,
throwing approximately 2,000,000
men out of employment, can be avert
ed only through the good offices of
President Wilson as a result of Sun
day's developments in tho dispute
over the men's demands for an eight-
hour day and time and a half for over
time. The controversv was laid be
fore the president at his invitation
after the workers had flatly rejected
any form of arbitration. They re
fused mediation.
BOTH SIDES TO WASHINGTON
Soon after accepting the presi
dent's summons, extended through
the federal board of mediation and
conciliation, the men announced that
the leaders of the four railroad broth
erhoods would leave for Washington
at midnight, accompanied by thirty
of the 600 delegates assembled.
ftAji hour later the railroad managers,-nineteen
in number, said that
they would leave for the capital at
the same time. Both parties reached
Washington in time for an cirlv con
