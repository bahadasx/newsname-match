earnest effort being made to work

road strike, appeared to have swung
round from the railroads to the em
ployes today.

' been in the White House for more

SLAVS ADVANCE
OH UPPER STRYPA
Petrogrud, Aug. 15. The Russians
have plorcod the new Austro-German
line on the Zlota LI pa river at a new
point, having crossed to the west bank
J of the river in a 12-mile advance
i from the upper Strypa, it was offici
ally claimed today.
Other Russian forces have crossed
to the western bank of the Zlota Bla-
trltxa, southwest of Stanlalau. In
'the south the Slavs approaching Hal
Its are several miles west of the Zlota
, Llpa and seriously threaten General
' Bathmer'a right flank and rear. Un
less the Russian advance is speedily
I checked, the A ust re-Germans must
continue their retreat until they reach
the Gnlsta Llpa river nearly 35
miles.
I Ten days ago the arrival of strong
bodies of Austrian and German rein-
'forcements was followed by heavy at
tacks that caused the Russian line
(to retire allghtty. It Is now believed
that these reinforcements have been
withdrawn and are being hurried to
the defense of Lemberg by a round-
i about route south of the Carpathians.
The Russians are now drawing In on
Lemberg on a curving 150-mile front.
At the nearest point, southwest of
Brody, they are about 45 miles from
the Gallcian capital.
GRENADE ATTACK
IIS FOR FRENCH
Paris. Aug. 15. A French gren
ade attack on the northeastern front
of Verdun last night resulted In
the capture of German trenches on
a front of. 300 yards to a depth of
100 yards, It was officially claimed
today. The gain was made In the
vicinity1 of Saint Fine chapel, at the
Intersection ' of the Fleury and Vaitx
roads,
German counter-attacks at this point
were checked. The Germans bom
barded French positions at Fleury
and on the Vaux-Chapltre aector.
A .German detachment last night
penetrated a French salient n6rth
weet of Beaulne, In the region north
of the Alsne, after an Intense bom
bardment. They were later expelled
by French counter-attack. '

LO BUR
CROPS I
Charge Is Made at Berlin
That the Allies Attempt to
Set Fire to Fields of Grab
With Incendiary Bombs
Berlin. Aug. 15. Allied mllltarr
chieftains hsve attempted to aid the
starve Germany out policy " by
setting fire to German harvest fields,
n'cordlng to reports received here.
The recent raids by Anglo-French
aviators over the 'Black Forest and
farm lands near Karlsruhe, are said
to have been experimental trips. In
cendiary bombs were dropped in sev
eral fields with the evident object
of starting great fires, but did only
slight damage.
Adolph ron Batockl, German food
director, said today there Is little
chance that the plan will succeed.
"In the first place, the fields have
not been dry enough to enable them
to start a great fire." he said. "In
the second place, many of the crops
are In. In the third place, we have
no large farms like you have In Am
erica, and If small farms lost their
crops In this manner, It would not af
fect the total. Don't forget, too, that
our aeroplanes are guarding our
farms as well as the trenches.
Furthermore, our htcrMt har
,
potatoes, cannot be burned' because
they are buried."
The oats supply from the new har
vest Is so good that horses' ration!
will be Increased, Batockl said. The
grain crop Is so good that bread
rations will be Increased and the fod
der prospects are so excellent that
Germany expectes to raise as large
a stock of pigs this fall as In peace
times. . '
By a special arrangement between
the government and the cattle rais
ers, the latter must deliver to the
government so many fat pigs in re
turn for fodder, which the govern
ment has monopolised. This Insures
a certain supply of pork and makes
unnecessary the slaughtering of
milch cowa unless they are dry.
"As the result of these steps, there
will be no shortsge In milk," said
Batockl.

TRIIJEII'S REPRESENTATIVE SAYS
STRIKE WDULD
Washington, Aug. 15. It a Btrlke
of the, 400,000 railway men of the
tour brotherhoods should be called,
the transportation of the.. United
States would be paralysed within a
minute after the order was Issued,
A. B, Garretson, of the conductors'
brotherhood declared today.
Garretson gave this Idea of the ef
fect of a strike, when asked how
long It would take to tie up the rail
roads, should the negotiations now
being conducted by President Wilson
fall. As for the movement of malls,
which would be affected by a strike
order, Garretson aald the railroads,
not the men, would be responsible.
"It la the railroads that have the
contracts for carrying the mall," he
said. "I do not see any reason why
we should supply men for this, The
roads would have to attend to It.
.'Industrial necessity," Garretson
said, "It a plea that Is the exousa tor
every kind of Injustice and oppres
sion. '

depths of 100 yards, It was officially
claimed at Paris. The gain was made
north of the Chapel of Saint Fine, at
the point where the German .line dips
closest to the city of Verdun.
Conflicting claims came from Pet-
rograd and Berlin today on the pro
gress of the Russian drive on Lem
berg. An official . statement - from
Petrograd claimed that another Slav
force haa crossed the Zlota Llpa river
and Indicates that the new Zlota

retreated from the river Strypa must
soon be abandoned nnder heavy Rus

Mount Pecinka and the capture of

Washington, Aug. 16. Because of
the threatened railroad strike the
war department today suspended In
definitely the proposed movement to
the border of between 25,000 and Zir
00Q mobilized militia In state camps
last week ordered to the Mexican
line." .: ' ' U V
The reason for suspending the ord
er Is a possible shortage of supplies
and difficulty of obtaining transport
ation for the men. It has no connec
tion, it is said with possible use of
the troops during the threatened
strike. Until further orders are Is
sued, none of the organizations which
are preparing to leave state camps
will be sent to the border." '
The order to keep the militiamen
at places near their mobilization
camps came from General Funs ton.
Funston's message follows:
"In view of the possibility of a
general railroad strike, I desire to
call the attention of the war depart
ment to difficulties that will follow In
maintaining food supplied not only
of troops in this department,' hot of
the civilian population as well.' These
border states produce little foodstuffs
except cattle." '
