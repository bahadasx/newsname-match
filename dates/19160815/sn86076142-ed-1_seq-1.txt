LONDON, August 13. The Austrians and Germans in Galicia
are still falling buck before the advance, of the Russians, who,
according to l'etrograd, have made additional gains along the Sereth
and ZIota Lipa rivers, arid have captured the strongly fortified 'town
of Tnstobaby, northwest of the Dniester.
The rapid Russian advance in Galicia continues. The Russians
are crossing to the western banks of the Zlota Lipa and Bystritza
Solotvina and advancing along the upper Stripa.
On the upper Sereth, however, the Teutonic allies at some points
on their newly chosen line are holding back the Russians with a
vigorous artillery tire. Berlin says that south of Brody on the
Lub and Graberka sector, Russian attacks were put down with
heavy losses and that Russians who had penetrated the Teutonic
positions ou the Zboroff Konjucay line, northeast of Tarnopol, were
driven off. .
The French captured the German trenches on a front of 300
yards long and 100 deep north of Chapel Saint Fine at the intersec
tion of the Fleury Vaux road, on the right bank of the Meuse, on
the Verdun sector. On the Soinme front French artillery is. active.
Nearly all the remaining trenches northwest of Pozieres, ou the
Soninie front, wherein the Germans gained a footing1 Sunday, have
been retaken.
The Austrians suffered further reverses at the hands of the
Italians on Carso plateau, east of Gorizia, along the Isoilzo front,
where Austrian entrenchments in both regions were captured.
l'etrograd reports a continuation of the Turkish offensive of the
Perxia nfrontier, but asserts that a retreat of the Turks lias been
forced on the southwest bank of Lake Van, through the fire of the
Russian flotilla ou the lake. The Turkish war. office says the
Persian frontier, but asserts that a retreat of the Turks has been
and that in Armenia, north of Bitlis, the Turks have.. made a further
advance. i

TOKIO, August 15. Chinese troops this morning attacked the
Japanese garrison at Chengchiatun, between Mukden and Chao
yangfu and have killed or wounded 17 Japanese soldiers and killed
one officer. According to official advices from Chengohiatnn, the
Japanese barracks now is besieged by Chinese soldiers.
Reinforcements are being rushed to the beleagured garrison
from the Japanese forces stationed at Kayuan and Sudinghai. The
fighting resulted from the arrest of a Japanese merchant.
ferences, but thus far he has made'
little progress toward a settlement of
the difficulties. It is known that he
suggested that the railway managers
accept the principle of the eight hour
day and leave the wording and appli
cation to the Interstate Commerce
commission or any other body.
An official close to the situation
expressed the opinion that the con-
lending factions ware apparently
deadlocked, although there still was
a possibility of agreement. It was
learned that the president used every
argument he could command to ob
tain concessions from both sides, but
thus far without success. The rail
roads are understood to be ready to
concede the eight hours provided the
concessions made to the brotherhoods
are not too heavy a burden to fall
alone on the railroads.
The men take the stand that the
eight hours' conditions shall be en
forced whenever possible. The rail
roads said they believe this impos
sible to accept unless a workable
system of application is possibly built
up.
While the managers were at the
White House the brotherhood lead
ers conferred, awaiting their call for
a conference with the president. The

CARRANZA OFFICER 8HOT DOWN
BY AMERICAN PROVOST
WITH PERSHING
(Sprrlal to tfca Boaaaaa.)
CARSON CITY, August 15. Victor
Barron, who Is serving a life term
at the prison, was shot and fatally
wounded at 8:30 o'clock this morning
In making an attempt to escape.
With two others he was confined In
the bull pen in the southeast corner
of the yard and, without giving evi
dence of his intention, climbed the
stone wall and attempted to get over
the wire fence 40 feet above. The
guards fired several warning slots.
but on the prisoner failing to desist
a shot was sent through his body
from the right side. ' He fell from
the wall to the shed below and
thence to ground.
Barron is still living, but the prison
doctor says be cannot survive.
Barron killed two Mexican section
men near Bonnie Clare and about
two months ago killed one prison
guard and maimed another in at
tempting to escape.
leaders are Inclined to the view that
the controversy can be settled by the
railroads granting a basis of eight
hours and arbitrating the demand
for time and a half overtime, or,
eliminating the double compensation
features, by having the railroads
make a flat agreement for an eight
hour day.
It is apparent that tbe feeling of
optimism prevailing yesterday haa
been dissipated.
No form of arbitration will now be
considered, the members of tbe em
ployes' committee declared. . They
K.tld there was a possibility of an
agreement being reached on one of
several compromises under considera
tion.
President Wilson conferred most
of the night with both parties to tbe
threatened ; country wide railway
strike and this morning It appeared
that sufficient foundation had been
laid to furni&h a working basis for a
settlement of the diqerences.
The foremost questions are what
shall be arbitrated. If arbitration is
to be resorted to, and what form of
arbitration shall be adopted. Tbe
employes are understood to be ready
to consent to the principle of arbitra
tion in the contigent proposals of the
managers, which the men "claim In
volve rights they have won la le
years' effort, are eliminated from
consideration, and if arbitration is
conducted by a board on which all
four brotherhoods are represented.
Immediately after learning the em
ployes' position the president sum
moned the committee of managers
and held a long conference with
them. They left the White House to
confer among themselves throughout
the night, if necessary, and the gen
eral understanding was that they dis
cussed the advisability of withdraw
ing their contingency proposals and
submitting a proposition "without
strings," as demanded by the men.
While representatives of the em
ployes insisted that they had not yet
agreed to arbitrate any future of
their differences, there was a growing
impression that arbitration, or some
form of compromise, would be agreed
upon. At no time, it was Bald, did
the representatives of the men Indi
cate that unless their demands were
granted unqualifiedly they would go
on strike. .
Both sides refused absolutely to
discuss their meeting with the presi
dent or venture any forecast on the
