ItAiSER DEFENDS HIS COURSE IN WAR
DOESN'T ENVY
MAN WHO HAS
. WAR ON HEAD
LONDON, Aug. 15.—"1 do not envy the
man who has the responsibility for this war
upon his conscience. I, at least, am not that
man. I think history will clear me of the
charge, altho I do not suppose history will
hold me faultless."
Kaiser Wilhelm was today quoted as
having made this statement to a prominent
neutral who visited Berlin on business of an
official character last year and made an
other visit last month.
"In a sense, every civilized man in
Europe/' the kaiser was quoted "must have
a share in the responsibility for this war, and
the higher his position the larger his respon
sibility. I admit that and yet claim that I
wted thruout in good faith and strove hard
Tor peace, even tho war was inevitable."
The neutral wa; about to leave Berlin when he ami other
member* oi a special deputation were united to leu with the
kai«enn and the kaiser, who fiad just returned from the
Western front, the Berne dispatch said.
The kaiser entered wearing a (.erman field uniform and.
after indulging in commonplaces about the weather, turner!
to a discussion of the war. S>mewhat to the embarrassment
of the neutral visitors, he suddenly put the question:
"I suppose the British theory that I was
responsible for the war has got a hold on
your own people."
Before any of his guests could reply, he
added:
"It it curious how this theory seems to
fascinate my enemies. Yet the people who
accuse me of having caused the war are the
very people who previously testified to the
earnestness of my desire for peace,
jr "Why is it that you neutrals always talk
about German militarism and never about
Russian despotism, the French craving for
revenge or English treachery?"

INSPECTOR "MIKE" PUTS LILLIAN BACK ON STRAIGHT ROAD TO HAPPINESS
This is one of the stories that Police Inspector
Mike I'owers told mc yesterday.
If the editor likes it I will find out when the
paper is off the press. If he doesn't like it I'll never
hear about it again, and the janitor alone will attend
its obsequies.
It's the story of Lillian.
I don't know her last name and it really doesn't
matter, for I wouldn't tell it if I did She was a real
girl is yet, for that matter a very beautiful flesh
and blood girl, and this i- her story.
One often read* of a girl being arrested, reads a
description of the charge against her, and an an
nouncement of her punishment. One seldom finds
the epilogue—the way it all came out.
I will I could tell Lillian's tory as Inspector
I'owers did, with the fine, enriching tratery of his
brogue — •

RAIL WORKERS
FACE BURDEN
Peace Nearer But Managers
Haven't Granted Wage
Increase
CONFERENCE GOES ON
WASHINGTON. Aug. 16-
Th* bunion of conc***ion* In
bringing about an adjustment
of the threatened railroad
strife* appeared to hsv* swung
around from the railroads to
th* employes today.
After the railroad manager*
had been In th* Whit* Home
for mor* than 1 1 2 hour*. It
wi* learned that they have
agreed to accept th* baalc prin
ciple of th* eight-hour day,
but they demand that the ques
tion of overtime pay b* sub
jected to a more far-reaching
Investigation.
At the conclusion of the confer
ence with the managers. President
Wllaon authorised the following
statement:
"The president spent an hour and
a half this morning with the repre
aentatlvea of Ihe railway managers.
After the conference he said It was
Impossible aa yet lo report as to
the results All that he could say-
Is that a very candid and honest
discussion was In progress about
the practicable basla of aettiement."
Their acceptance of th« baalc
principle of the eight-hour day la
mad« contingent upon agreement
by the employe* to a further and
more far reaching discussion which
afiould Include the question of
overtime pay.
According to one of the men who
attended the conference, the fol
lowing Is their position:
"Wk *pcp.pt the principle of the
eight-hour day. However, the
eight-hour day question I* so ob
viously and naturally a part of the
overtime question that the two will
have to be handled as one prob
lem."

HIS ROOM IS
SECRET EVEN;
NOT ILL NOW
William Goodsell Rockefeller, railroad
magnate and almost as rich as his brother,
John D. Rockefeller, the oil king, was hiding
in the New Washington hotel Tuesday.
After considerable work by a reporter,
it was learned that Rockefeller had regis
tered at the Washington on a private regis
try—one not accessible to the public.
Furthermore, he left emphatic instruc
tions with the management that he was not
to be interviewed or seen under any condi
tions. Instructions were left with the desk
clerks that even his room number should be
kept a secret.
It is believed his room is on the 10th floor,
since it was learned that C. A. Goodnow,
assistant to A. J. Earling, president of the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railway, with
whom Rockefeller is traveling, had
room 1007.
"I don't want any publicity while I am in
Seattle/' Rockefeller instructed the hotel
management. "I don't like it."
Secretiveness is not a new trait in him.
During the "money trust" investigation
in New York, he barricaded himself in his
home to escape subpoena servers.
He was before the public last when his
physicians said he was too ill to travel to the
New York hearing, after the subpoena was
finally served on him in Florida.
That his health has improved since is in
ferred from the fact that he has taken a
cross-country trip to Seattle.
He is accompanied by his wife, President
Earling and Goodnow. The party took an
automobile ride over Seattle Tuesday morn
ing.
Milwaukee officials reported the party
will remain in Seattle for three days at least
and will leave for the East afterward. They
are inspecting the Milwaukee system.

inspector Powers found h certain Seattle great man who has money
enough to help other people, and told him of Uilllan. and the reeull
whs a ticket to Spokane lie took the ticket to Judge Gordon and told
him what he wanted to do. and the Judge said It might he a mistake,
because the chap might get her off the train, but. by CJeorse. It was

Then Inspector Powers put l.illlan on the train and started h«r

•THE FINEST MAN IN THE WORLD"
That much of the story appears on the police records. Th»
fact* of that much have been printed In newspapers. But In
a certain drawer in Inspector Power*' desk Is the epilogue—
the way it all came out.
The epilogue I* a note, a dainty, well-bred little note. It It
directed to "My very good friend, Inspector Power*," and It la
from Lillian.
It thank* him very earnestly and simply for aaving her with
hi* faith, and It tells him that she Is very happy and will never
leave Spokane again. In the last line it mention* an approaofe
