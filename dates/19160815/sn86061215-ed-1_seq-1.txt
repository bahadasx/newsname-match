US MEDIATOR
TO PREVENT BIG
President Confers With the
Brotherhood Leaders at
the White House
MANAGERS ALSO
TALK TO EXECUTIVE
(Effort Made to Find Some
Common Ground on Which
the Factions Can Agree
Washington, D. C., Aug. 14.—Rail
road managers and brotherhood lead
ers, deadlocked in negotiations which
threaten a nation wide railroad strike,
today laid their case, before President
Wilson.
First came thirty-fire representa
tives of the brotherhoods who confer
red with the president shortly after
10 o'clock. They were followed by the
committee of managers.
The brotherhood men went into the
conference firm in their determination
not to accept an arbitration under the
Newlands act.
There were some indications that
the president might propose a special
arbitration board of twelve members,
on which the four great brotherhoods
could be represented.
The president's plan was to appeal
to managers and men on the highest
patriotic grounds to find a way to com
pose their differences without a strike.
The president's conference with the
men was opened with a statement by
A. B. Garretson of the conductors, as
spokesmen. He outlined the demands
for an eight hour day and time and a
half for overtime. He insisted that
the demands were fair. President Wil
son then addressed the men, pointing
out what disaster would follow a gen
eral strike and insisting that an agree
ment must be reached.
Gets Specific Demands.
The president then asked to know
the specific things on which the em
ployes were prepared to insist. Mr.
Garretson did most of the talking for
the men and he and the president dis
cussed the Situation thoroughly. Mr.
Wilson promised to take the demands
up with the managers in an effort to
find a common ground on which the
two sides could meet. He said he was
anxious to settle the difficulty as quick
ly as possible and was prepared to re
main in continuous conference all day
If necessary.
The conference was held in the
freen room of the white house. Large
crowds of tourists gathered on the
lawn in front of the white house to
bear news of the proceedings.
Chiefs To Call Again.
After being with the president two
hours, ^he representatives of the men
left the white house and Mr. Garretson
said they expected to see the president
again later in the day after he had con
ferred with the managers. Mr. Gar'
retson refused to say whether the out
look was hopeful.
"As long as the matter is in Presi
dent Wilson's hands we will have no
statement to make," said Mr. Garret
son.
Mr. Garretson was asked whether
the negotiations were off. He replied:
"Absolutely not."
One of the leaders of the four broth
erhoods after leaving the white house
characterized the conference with the
president as "most encouraging" and
declared "the outlook for the preven
tion of a general strike was hopeful."
It was arranged that the managers
tihould se$ the president at 3 o'clock
this afternoon and that meanwhile the
president would keep one or two other
Important engagements, including one
with Mr. Chambers of the federal
board.
At the white house it was said no
Indication could be given of the pro
Kress of the negotiations until the
president saw the managers.
Hope.for Peafee.
"The president was most sympathe
tic," said one of the brotherhood lead
ers, "and his surprising knowledge of
the' situation and of our position may
result in an understanding being reach
ed."
The president, it was said, submitted
no counter proposition to the men but
he held out hope for an adjustment by
legislation, if necessary.
The impression prevailed among the
brotherhood leaders that as a last re
sort the president might ask congress
for eight hour day legislation.
The leaders explained to the presi
dent their stand against arbitration by
saying that they were carrying out the
lwishes pf the 600 delegates who sat
"with them at their meeting with the
federal mediators.
The brotherhood leaders presented
to the president detailed reports of
the vote cast in favor of a general
strike.

EMPLOYES VIEW

NEUTRAL ARBITERS UNFAIR TO
MEN BECAUSE OF PRIVATE
INTERESTS AT 8TAKE.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 14.—Before
the conferences called by President
Wilson with a view to preventing a
general railroad strike, began this
morning, A. B. Garretson, speaking for
the railway trainmen's brotherhoods,
declared that the men were through
with arbitration under the Newlands
act. Previous arbitrations under that
law, he reiterated, had demonstrated
that the neutral arbitrators held the
balance of power. He said any spe
cial arbitration into which the men
might agree to enter would have to
make provision for an extension of
those arbitrators to give the men
what they consider a fair chance.
"The chief objection to the exist
ing form of arbitration on the part
of the brotherhoods," said Garretson
today, "centers on the difficulty that
has been experienced in selecting neu
tral arbitrators who could do justice
to the cause of the men. In the past
there have been neutral arbitrators of
high standing and intelligence such
men as John H. Finley of New York
and Seth Low, former mayor. No mat
ter how honest their intentions they
could not "bring to bear on the ques
tions at issue the disinterestedness
necessary. Finley's future relies en
tirely on the direction of corporate in
fluences, while Low, although honest,
was surely influenced by the fact that
he is a large owner of stocks and
bonds.
"The appointments of neutral arbi
trators in the past under this provi
sions of the Newlands act have dam
med arbitration as a practical propo
sition in the minds of the men."

AUSTRIAN ARMY
IN BAD POSITION
French Make Gains Taking
Them Nearer Peronne,
Present Objective
London, Aug. 14 t—The Russian drive
in Galicla is pushing the Austro
German armies backward toward Lem
berg at a rapid rate.
Both flanks of Gen. Count von Both
mer's army on the Lemberg front are
under heavy pressure and its center,
forced from the line of the Stripa, is
accounted by military observers in en
tente capitals to have none too secure
a position in its rear along the upper
Zlota Lipa, to which it is presumed to
be retreating.
Petrograd today announces new
gains for the Russians on the northern
wing of this front, on the upper Sereth,
while to the south Gen. Letchitzky is
continuing his thrust up the Dniester
in the vicinity of Mariampol, seven
miles from Halicz. The Russian armies
in the center also are pursuing the
Austrians in the middle Stripa and
Koropice regions.
Continuing their advance from Go
rizia on the Isonzo front, the Italians
have made further progress on the
Carso plateau to the southeast.
The Germans, have sharply counter
attacked along the line west of Po
zieres, which last night the British
carried to .a depth of 300 or 400 yards
on a front of nearly a mile. The at
tack was partly successful.
French Advance.
Following up their gains on the
north bank of the Somme, the French
are pushing their advance to a point
where German evacuation of Clery,
commanding the direct approach to
Peronne from the northwest may be
compelled. Fighting is being contin
ued in the' Maurepas sector northwest
of Clery. To the left of the Fay
Deniecourt road a French attack re
sulted in carrying some trenches.
The Turks claim to have compelled
the British to retreat east of the Suez
canal with heavy losses, but London
asserts that British cavalry is still in
pursuit of the Turkish rear guard.
The British in Mesopotamia attempt
ed an advance against the Turks along
the Euphrates river but retreated after
two hours' fighting. Further advances
against the Russians on the Persian
front also are claimed by the Turks.
ITALIANS GAIN.
Rome, Aug. 14.—Italian troops con
tinued yesterday pressing the Aus
trians back on the Carso plateau and
east of hill 212 pierced another strong
line of hostile entrenchments. About

points north of Lee.
Miss Torkelson, who was shot twice,
is in a hospital here, but is not ex
pected to live. She waB engaged to
O'Brien but the engagement was
broken at the request of her mother
because of O'Brien's alleged temper.
O'Brien charged her with receiving
the attentions of other men and while

Morris he overtook them in his motor
car. When Miss Torkelson refused to
get into the car with him, O'Brien
fired two bullets into her body.

a hardware store the capture of a
man and woman attempting to dispose
of an automobile said to belong in
Lincoln, Nebr., and the taking from
Burlington No. 6 of a negress believed
to be crazed with "dope," furnished
this city with more than the regular
measure of excitement Sunday.
The Richardson hardware store on
the east side of the square, was broken
Into early Sunday morning and two
young men giving the names of Dale
Boss, of Sioux City, and Ed. Von Kut
zluben, of Burlington, about 18 and 19

razors manicure sets, etc., were found
on the young men who are now in jail
awaiting their hearing which may be
held late this afternoon.

successfully Sunday afternoon to a
man and woman giving the names of
Mr. and MTS. Frank Samuels, of New
York, Nebr., who earlier in the after
noon called at the Stortz garage and
offered to sell an almost new car for
the sum of $250. The car bore no
number and the suspicions of Mr.

purchase the auto he later notified
Sheriff Campbell. The latter having
knowledge of a car of similar kind
stolen at Lincoln, Nebr., recently,
gave chase to the pair, who In the

press train bound east, arrived here

boarded the train at Albia. Her con
duct on the train was such that the
conductor wired ahead for an officer
to meet the train at Fairfield and the
actions of the woman who is said to
have been a dope fiend and crazed by
drugs, necessitated three men to take
her from the station to the jail a block
away. Twenty minutes were consumed
in the task. The coat of the conductor
and the shirt of one of the officers
were torn by the woman who fought
like a manic. She was placed in a
padded cell in Jail.
