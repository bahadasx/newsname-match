Only Two Were
Exempt
Miss Frederick, the visiting nurse,
has returned from an inspection of
the schools in various parts of the
county and will probably leave some

anion? the school children. Of the
schools examined only two were en
tirely free from the disease.
On all examinations Miss Frede
rick was accompanied by a doctor.
Following is the list of schools visit
ed and the doctors who were rrere t:
Copper Springs, Dr. C. A, Morion,
of Hanson; Suthards, D.r. W. P.

LEAVING SATURDAY AUGUST 26
When the Bee's party about foriy
strong, leave Evansville on Saturday,
Aug. 26th. on the steamer Evansville
they will start on one of the most in
teresting 412 mile river trips in this
country. Among other things they
will pass through six locks as follows:
Lock No. 1 at Spottsville, Lock Wo.
2 at Runuey, Lock No. 3 at Roches
ter, Lock No. 4 at Woodbury, Lock
No. 5 at Massye Springs. Lock No.
6 at Brownsville. In addition to the
novelty of passing through these
locks the party will have the oppor
tunity of viewing some of the most
magnificent scenery on upper green
river there is to be seen anywhere,
the huge masses of rocks are piled
uo 200 feet bieh alone the banks of
the river reminding one of some of
the old castles in England and bcott
land described by Sir Walter bcott
in Waverlv Novels. The delightful
scenery is not all, one of the chief
treasures of a river trip is to gather
on the upper deck alter supper ana
watch the passing scenery by moon
light while enjoying the cool river
breeze and listening to, sweet strains
ot music trom tne nana Deiow.
On these river trips everyone is al
lowed to do as they please as long as
they please to do right. Everything
possible is done for the comfort and
enjoyment of all and it is just like a
big house party. If you wish to
shoot turtles off the logs, alright; if
you wish to dance, music is furnished;
if vou wish to play "500" go to it
if you wish to read, take kodak pic
tures, go in the engine room or up In
the pilot house, watch the deck hands
ride calves and pigs down the bank
into the river, .vou are free to do so,
and nothing is said or thought about
it. as the boat crew from Capt wu
liams down, want you to have a good
t me. When you get to tne cave
vour baggage is looked after and you
have nothing to do but eat breakfast
and get on your cave suit preparatory
to taking one of the routes.
If you have ever been in Mam
moth Cave you v, ill never forget it.
If vou have never been vou will al
1 ways regret it. It is one of the great

EXPECT ORDERS
TO MOVE TODAY
Kentuckv Guardsmen Will
Begin Actual Entraining
Wednesday or
Thursday
Ft. Thomas. Ky.. Aug. 14. De
tail orders providing for the early en
training of the Kentucky brigade for
the border are expected in camp to
dav. The actual entraining is ex
pected to begin Wednesday or Thurs
day. Seventv-two hours is the min
imum laid down by the railroads as
the time necessary for preparations
incident to the movement of a bri
gade. Captain George Armstrong,
quartermaster and commissary of the
Kentucky brigade, said today that J.
F. Poindexter, secretary of the Amer-
lto him that notification of extended
y movement of the Kentucky troops had
been given to the railroad s represen
tatives in Washington.
Two or three days will be necessary
to prepare for the movement of the
brigade. Commissary officers al
ready have begun the collection of the
necessary food supplies for the jour
ney to the border.'
During the period that the prepar
ations are going forwjard, brigade of
hcers are looking forward to an in
crease inflow of recruits. It is be
lieved that the apparent certainty of
border service will supply the needed
stimulus and overcome the lethargy
that set in with the subsidence of the
Mexican crisis.

PUBLIC NUISANCE

and Gave Money to De

He says

Federation of Labor, was character
ized as a "public nuisance," by Sen

gression today from a Senate speech

"There is no more tyrannical, out'
rageouse injustice than that, of lead
ers who live on the sweat of other
people's brow," said Senator Sher
man. "Mr. Gompers. is a public
nuisance."
Referring to the Indianayolis and
Los Angeles dynamite trials, Senator
Sherman declared the federation pres
ident had "prostituted the cause of
labor by using funds,of laboring men
for the defense of these criminals.'
MV finmtvr never rinnlntned

it to him now, and I'm responsible

known livervman of Madisonville.
fell dead in his office at the livery
stab e of heart trouble. Mr. Barnhill
has a large number of friends in this

News From Washington That
Troops Will Move Soon
TRAVEL RATIONS MUST
COME FROM ST, LOUIS

General McCain said at noon
that the Kentucky troops would
leave for the border immediate
ly transportation is arranged for
them.
He told Representative S ler-
ley that the question of equip
ment would not be permitted to
delay the departure. Therefore,
the time when the entire cnard
will be on its way will rest en
tirely with the transportation
companies.
Fort Thomas, Ky Aug. li.
The Kentucky brigade officers
were still without official orders
from Washington regarding the)
mobement to the border. Gen.
Williams and other officers said
they expected detailed orders
some time today.
The quartermaster's depart-1
ments of the different units start
ed early this morning packing
all sjurplus equipment and sup
plies. The packing of boxes and
the noise of the hammer were
sweet music to the ears of the
guardsmen and the men went at
their tvork with a will.
There is some doubt in tha
minds of the officers as to when
the troops will start. The rail
roads are believed tOybe assem
bling cars near here ;6r the trip
South.
Another indication that tbe
department meaos business was
that on instructions from the De
partment of the East Oapt.
Zointer, of the United States
Quartermaster Department, or
dered by telegraph travel rations
for ten davs for the troops. Tha
rations have to come from St.
Louis and will be rushed here at
once. (
That the order from Washing
ton to move to the border has
put more life and spirit into tha
guard as a whole is evident beret
this morning. Recruiting is pro
ceeding at a better clip and tho
numbers ure jumping fast.
