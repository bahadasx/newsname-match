By .Ewing Lewis
Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 14.—Captain
'A. B. Welch has a Spanish garden in
front of his tent, graced with as many
palms as a church wedding. Lots of
landscape gardening talent was dis­
covered in Co. A when the men got
down to the border and they have
been experimenting with Spanish bay­
onet, palms, cactus and lots of plants
which no one knows the names of.
Spanish bayonets line the company
street. They are not only ornamental,
as Sergeant Ferris Cordner pointed
out today, but they are useful as bur­
glar alarms. Any night prowler is
likely to pinion himself on one of the
bayonets and rouse the camp with a
y«ll of pain.
The men of A company were wiser
tnan the soldiers from Indiana and
Nebraska, quartered three miles to
the west at Llano Grande. The men
at Llano Grande transplanted hund­
reds of fine palms from the woodB to
their company streets,- but they did
not take the trouble to dig them up
by the roots. They are already look­
ing like a corn field in November, and
ofl^r?.hAy*Qrdexjed 4etoUftte,go iwt
into the* mesQUjte woods and bring
back palms with roots,
Letters oT Shells.
"I caftnot get ov6r the idea that a
big palm is worth a twenty-dqllar
bill," said Arthur Brown. "Every
time I dig one up I think how tickled
my folks would be if I could carry it
home &fcd start- a conservatory."
A Minnesota officer who admired
Capt. Welch's new "door-plate," cun­
ningly made Of shells, told how his
men had made a similar work of art,
but unfortunately used live snails and
the letters crawled off during the
night.
William Carrick was the first man
of Company A to be stung by a scor­
pion. No guardsman from the north
feels really acclimated on the border
until he has received the attention of
one 'of these little dagger-tailed in­
sects. The sting is not serious if it
is treated at once, and the soldiers
hold the Texan scorpion in no more
awe than a bumble-bee at home.
•Posner Bitten.
Oweii Pbsner was bitten by a centi­
pede and the wound made an ugly
swelling. Centipedes, scorpions and
rattlesnakes were the only residents
in the suburbs of Mercedes until the
troops came and some of the old set­
tlers have apparently decided to stay
with the newcomers. But most of
them have retreated Into the chap
paral, and call on the soldiers only
occasionally.
It is still a subject of dispute in the
camps from Harlingen to Mission
whether a' newspaper correspondent
ought to' admit" to the people up north
that a scorpion or centiped wound
isn't a very serious matter. Sympath­
etic telegrams and large consign­
ments of cakes and preserves were
sent to the first victims, and the men
who were wounded later feel that
they should be treated the same way.
A New York artilleryman at Mission
told me that when he wrote home
that he had been stung by a scorpion
his sister sent him, in care of the
hospital, two suits of pajamas, five
pounds of cake and enough maga­
zines to last him two weeks.

British Embassy Tells of Method
Used in Looking Over In­

DELAY HAS BEEN
GREATLY REDUCED
Washington, Ms. 14-—An explana­
tory statement of how Great Britain's
examination of mails is being con­
ducted was presented today to Secre­
tary I&nsing by the British embassy.
It is preparatory to the more com
prehnsive reply to the American re­
presentations^ now being prepared
jointly by the iLondon and Paris for­
eign offices.
Figures given in the statement
show the aterage time for examina­
tion of intercepted mail is from one to
tthre» ,days# TberroiiHniUflidelay to
mall Between the United States aifd"
Holland is given as two days and the
maximum at seven. Danish mails
have been delayed from seven to ten
days when it has been necessary to
remove them from a ship otherwise,
only four days.
"It is admitted," says the state­
ment, "that at the outset, neutral cor­
respondence in which enemy inter­
ests were in no way concerned, was
subjected to a delay, which is greatly
regreted and which has since been re­
duced to a minimum. It must not be
imagined that the mains were remov­
ed from neutral ships" for examina­
tion without careful consideration of
the arrangements which would be re­
quired to deal with them as quickly
as possible. All preparations, which
seemed necessary were with this ob­
ject, but unfortunately those respon­
sible for them were not aware of
some of the difficulties which would
be encountered.
"For instance, there was no reason
to suppose (as proved to be the case)

The youth was captured early to­
day, after he had eluded a posse,

O'Brien was suffering from hunger
and told the authorities that he had
planned to give himself up. He was
removed to Yorkkville, as threats of
lynching had been made.
Flees in High-Power Car.
When O'Brien shot his sweetheart,
who was riding to 'Morris, he fled in
his hifch-powered motor car. He drove
to the home of an uncle near Lee
Thursday night and demanded a

Men and Is Royglly Received
by Fair $ex.
Spokane, Wash., Aug. 14.—Charles
E. Hughes today addressed his first
audience composed solely of women
woters. Thpy heard him in the first
of two speeches delivered here. Mr.
Hughes touched on Suffrage and his
views concerning it and reiterated to
a large extent, his attacks on the ad­
ministration made at Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho.
"I speak to you women as I do to
men," the nominee said. "I did not
come here to make a different kind of
speech from the kind I make to men.
I know you are solicitous about the
welfare of this country. There is no
doubt that the heart of womanhood is
patriotic all through."
Mr. Hughes' salutation of the wo­
men as "yellow-citizenft" was applaud­
ed. He told them h^-yas interested
in good national housekeeping and
the means of effecting it.

different notion aboyt^the conduct of

Is not the world of even 25 years ago.
This world is a world that has found
itself. It has found itself in the de­
pression of a terrible gethsemane.
Horrible as the spectacle of war,
frightful as is waste, we cannot look
upon them without realizing that a
new Europe is emerging from this
struggle. We cannot contemplate the
conditions of the Twentieth Century
without knowing there is to be a new
spirit in the United States, if our
prosperity is to have a different foun­
dation. It must be a spirit which de­
mands efficient, impartial govern­
ment, in the interest of all the peo­
ple."
"It is easy for some to become en­
thusiastic when the bands are play
ing, and the flags unfurled."
"When they hear the strains of the
national anthem and the crowds are
around them, but we must have a
new spirit of enthusiasm in the hum­

work of (patriotism in the administra­

est lesson for popular government to
learn. Every day in the year is a
more severe test of patriotism than
the Fourth of July."
iMr. Hughes declared that he con­
sidered a protective tariff essential
to the continuance of prosperity.
"The only chance that the present
administration has to carry this elec­
tion," he said, "is because the Euro­
pean war has saved it from a dem­
onstration of its inefficiency."
The nominee repeated his asser­
tion that the Democratic party had
ascribed to itself benefits accruing
from the war.
"I wonder if they think that the
Democratic party and the European
war are sysnonymous?" he said. He
spoke of conditions here after the
war.

IITH IDE:
Foremost Question Ife What Form
of Arbitration Shall Be

THOUGHT STRIKE
WILL BE AVERTED
Brotherhood Impressed By Presi­
dent's Grasp of the Impending
Critical Situation.
Washington, Aug. 14.—President
Wilson conferred today with both
parties to the country-wide threaten­
ed railroad strike- and tonight it ap­
peared that sufficient foundation had
been laid to furnish a working basis
for a betaement of the differences of
the employees and employers. The
president will meet both sides again
tomorrow.
At the conclusion of the day's con­
ferences the president issued this
statement:
"I have met both sides and have
gona over the case with the utmost
frankness. I shall not be able' to
Judge -'Qatll tomorrow wbe&e)£«&ifc
have found a feasible basis for settle­
ment."
The Leading Question*.
The foremost questions are what
shall be arbitrated, if arbitration is to
be resorted to, and what form of arbi­
tration shall be adopted. Represent­
atives of the employees maintain that
their demands for an eight-hour day
and time and a half for overtime is
the only concrete proposition under
discussion. They insisted to the pres­
ident in their conference today that
the railroads make some definite
counter proposal. If the railroads
submitted some proposed form of
settlement, they said, they would be
ready to discuss negotiations further.
The employees are understood to
be ready to consent to the principle
of arbitration, if the contingent pro­
posals of the managers, which the
men claim involve rights they have
won in thirty years' effort, are elimin­
ated from consideration, and if arbi­
tration is conducted by a board on
which all four brotherhoods are re­
presented.
Wilson Confers With Magnates.
Immediately after learning the em­
ployees' position, the president sum­
moned the committee of managers
and held along conference with them.
They left the White House to confer
among themselves throughout the
night, if necessary, and the general
understanding is they discussed the
advisability of withdrawing their
"contingency" proposal and submit­
ting a proposition "without strings,"
as demanded by the men.
While representatives of the em­
ployees insisted that they had not
yet agreed to arbitrate any feature of
their differences, there was a grow­
ing impression that arbitration, or
some form of compromise would be
agreed upon.
Both sides agreed absolutely to dis­
cuss their meeting with the president
or venture any forecast on the prob­
able outcome of the negotiations, but
leaders of the two factions were opti­
mistic tonight that a strike would be
avoided.
Will Meet Again Today.
The president, it was declared,
made no compromise propositions to
either side today. He merely listened
to the employees' representatives and
then talked with the managers and
suggested that some concrete work­
ing basis be agreed upon before pro­
ceeding further. Indicative of his de­
sire to learn what results come from
the railroad managers' meeting to­
night before taking any further steps,
he arranged another meeting with
them for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning,
and a conference with the representa­
tives of the .employees for 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow's
cabinet meeting has been canceled so
the president may devote most of his
time to the railroad problem.
Reports that the president had noti­
fied the managers that unless some
agreement could be reached with the
men, he would invoke his power with
congress to pass an eight-hour law,
were circulated but discounted by
those in close touch with the situa­
tion.
"I would fight any attempt to pass
such a measure," was the terse re-
