COI'KMIACIEN, August H (via Lon- j

of the Danish Parliament, to-day voted .
in favor of selling tlie Danish West i
Indies to the United Stales, if a pie- i
blscitc favored ttte sale. The vote was j
sixty two for the proposition to forty-j
four against it. one member beings de
nied a vote and six being absent.
Having taken this action, the Koike-i
thing took up the question of ratiflca* !
lion r.f the treaty Itself. providing fori
the salo of the Islands The vote was!
the same as that upon the question of
the sale.

The fart that the opposition In the:
Fnlkethinc was not in the slightest
decree placated hv the government's i
proposed plebiscite?the division was
Ihe same as had been predicted two
days ago?appears to Justify the pre
diction that the Landsthing, where the
opposition is in the majority, will re
ject the treaty. A rejection would
mean a delay of probably three months
In the final disposition of the islands,
since general elections hardly could be
finished before the end of October, and
the new government probably would
not get into harness before the middle
of November.
| The Associated Press is assured by
the highest sources that the govern
ment at no t iine had. nor has, the
slightest desire to evade a test of
strength at general elections. hut
would greatly regret their becoming
necessary in the case of the West
Indian islands for two reasons. The j
first of these Is because of the delay |
which thus would be caused, and the I
second because the proposed plebiscite ;
Mould take the West Indies question i
out of politics and compel a decision
solely on objective grounds.
As th< situation now stands, the
whole matter has become one of purely
internal party politics, in which the
disposition of the islands is all but lost
sight of. The government feels that
the sale or retention of the islands
ought not to be made dependent I
any degree on internal strife of the ;
various parties, which it would be if!
the decision is thrown in with the
^ varied issues of a general election.

returned to-night with stories of the
damage done. Great trees are up
rooted. Brown's Hotel. on White

ATTACK ON GOMPERS

X uUnnce.
WASHINGTON. August 14. ?In the
course of a speech in the Senate this
afternoon Setiator Sherman, of Illinois,
made a bitter attack on Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of 1-abor.
"Samuel Gompers has shown in hiu
conduct of the affairs of his organiza
tion that he intends to attempt to de
liver the organized labor vote of this
country," declared Mr. Sherman. "I do
not belteve this man is capable of so
controlling the members of organized
labor.
I "The rule of Gompers as president of
I the federation has been tyrannical and
i arbitrary. He has issued his edicts
against public men and attempted to
drive them from public ollloe because ?
they would not follow his dictation.
"As the would-be censor of others' j
political opinions, lie ought to he I
thankful that he was not indicted with '
the Indianapolis dynamiters, because
he issued a statement that they were '
innocent anil had been persecuted by
capital. The ink on that statement
was hardly dry before the McNamaras
pleaded guilty to the crime and were i
sent to the penitentiary. Samuel i
Goinpers himself is a public nuisance." j

ducted by a board on which all four
brotherhoods are represented.
Immediately after learning the em
ployees' position. the President sum
moned the committee of managers and
held a long conference with them,
n.ey left the White Ifouse to confer
among themselves throughout tho
"ight. ,f necessary, and the general
understanding was that they discussed
the advisability of withdrawing their
contingency" proposals and submit
ting a proposition "without strings" as
demanded by the men.
CllOWIXfi IMI'HKSSION of
COMIXG AUI11T1IATIO.V
While representatives of the em
ployees Insisted that they had not vet
agreed to arbitrate any feature ' of
their differences, there was a growing
impression that arbitration, or soma
form of compromise, would bo agreed
upon. At no time, it was said, did tho
representatives of the men indicate
that unless their demands were granted
unqualifiedly they would go on strike.
froth sides refused absolutely to rlis
cuss their meeting with the President
or venturo any forecast on the prob
able outcome of the negotiations, but
leaders of the two factions were opti
mistic to-night that a strike would" bo
avoided.
The President, it was declared, mad*
no compromise propositions to either
side to-day. Ho merely listened to tho
employees' representatives and then
tnlked with the managers, and sug
gested that some concreto working
basis be agreed upon before proceeding
further. Indicative of his desire to
learn what results rome from the rail
road managers' meeting to-night be
fore taking any further step, he ar
ranger! another meeting with them for
0 o'clock to-morrow morning und 5t
conference with the representative.- of
the employees for .1 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon.
The Cabinet meeting to-morrow has
canceled so the President may ,lo
vote his time to thcr railroad question.
e canceled several engagements to
day that he might have the fullest
opportunity to talk with the two sides.

I'OXTK.M) THAT HALAXCK
POWER IS TOO CI.OSR
The hoard of arbitration provided
h> that act. they maintain, is too small.
The balance of power, they contend, in
too close, and as a result the employees
i.ne suffered. Indications were that
tho President, recognizing tho situ
"'1' might propose a special board of
arbitration, if the negotiations reach
the arbitrating stage, composed of as
mniiv ;,s twelve men. including repre
