FOR SUNDAY LAW
New Commission Named by Thompson to Take Respon

Mayor Thompson selected an of

reform bunch.
The commission will consist of
Charley Fitzmorris, the mayor's sec
retary; Serg't John Naughton, one
of Chief Healey's right-hand men,
and an ass't corporation counsel to

to shift the entire responsibility of
the Sunday closing onto the shoul

was put in operation today at a con
ference between the mayor, Sam Et
telson and Chief Healey.

loonkeepers. Out of the 60 violations
reported Sunday I found that about
40 were technical violations that- did
