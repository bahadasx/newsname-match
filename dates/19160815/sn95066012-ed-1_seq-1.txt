The trouble was generally worse in
damp weather or when 1 caught cold.
I heard a great deal about Doan's Kid

at Cole's Drug Store and began using
them. In a few days, I felt better and
after I had finished one box, my back
was free from pain and the other symp

Some Present Day Practices Con
demmed by Dr. Holmes
PLE4SING CHATAUQU A PROGRAMS
Lecture, Two Enjoyable Conceits and
"The Man from Home" Cjlight
Large and Appreciative Audience
Two concerts by the Gianville-1 lines
company, a lecture on "Luxury and
Li i:-ure" by Dr. Holmes, and the pre
sentation of the play "The Man from
Home" were the features of the Chau
tauqua programs of Monday, at each
of which there was a creditable at
tendance. The lecture by Dr. Holmes
wsa the second of a series on different
educational phases and was a forceful
discourse on some of the foolishnesses
of present day living.
Dr. Holmes said that people should
not become the slaves of the things
that they possess' and should not fos
ter a desire to obtain a:i overwhelming
collection Of useless articles. Much
labor is wasted in making useless orn
aments, for as long as people will buy
trash it will be manufactured and sold
to them. Whereas furniture and oth
er household necessities used to be
made for long and hard use, they are
now made merely for looks and DO
longer are articles titted for the pur
pose they are supposed to serve.
People should, the speaker said, turn
toward a greater simplicity of life and
not misuse leisure which is the great
est luxury of man. People have the
idea that leisure should be spent In
idleness, the reading of trash or play
ing filly games. Leisure should be
spent in doing the things in which we
find our cliiel Interest and should br
employed in some mariner which will
inspire us to bo better citizens. It in
a duty of each of us to feel that we
owe a part of our time to our country
in acquainting ourselves with its is
sues. It should be employed in some
part to devoting oneself to the dill!
cult problems which confront our
democracy.
The two concerts of the Granville
Hincs company, one in the afternoon
and a Second In the evening proved
to be one of the best enjoyed musical
numbers of the present Chautauqua.
No more enthusiastic applause has
been awarded any feature in the tent
this year than was accorded Mr. Hines
and Mr. Granville. Two songs sung
by Mr. Granville which found particu
lar favor with the audience were "Its
a Long. Long, Trail" and "No, John,
on John, No." Tiro latter was first
sung lit the afternoon concert and by
request in the second entertainment.
The presentation of the play, "The
Man From Home." by the Chautauqua
players was a finished production of
one of Americas most wholesome
lays. This play Is built upon Amerl
an ideals and is replete with ind
ents which depict the homely truths
that are fundamental in American
life. The actors and actresses in the
Ihautauqua company presented the
play lii B way w hich brought the great
lesson It teaches home to each inoin-
er of the large audience.

RECRUITS GOING SOON
Railroads Receive Orders to Entrain
Enlisted Men
Burlington. Aug. 15 The Central
Vermont railroad company got an or
der Saturday afternoon to prepare to
start the rest of the Vermont militia
for the front at short notice. The
war department issued a general or
der Saturday afternoon that all the re
maining militia throughout the count
ry which have not yet been sent to
Mexico, entrain immediately upon re
ceiving orders. When the twelve com
panies of Infantry went off to the bord
er, the orders to the railroad and Adjutant-General
Lee S. Tillotson ar
rived almost .simultaneously, but the
departure Of the regiment was delayed
about ;iii hours pending the arrival of
equipment It
ht ad-quarters,
gun companies,
lonal company
la expected that the
supply and machine
as well as the provis
at Fort Ethan Allen,
will leave tomorrow
The actual order bad
or Wednesday,
not reached the
hands of the adjutant-General up to
last night.
Captain B, s. Hyland of Rutland,
commanding officer at the camp and
head of a company, said the order to
entrain had heen expected ever since
the railroad received its order. Put
the war department Issued an order,
still in effect at this writing, that the
militia could not leave until order to
tho national guard of the country in !
tho first place was that no company
(,f militia could depart until It was ful
ly equipped and at minimum or peace
strength at least. The four compan
ies are strong enough numerically, hut
ttlll lack the ponchos, mosquito hars
and hed sacks, one ol each for every
enlisted man, required for summer and
winter service.
The recruiting stations at Morris
ville, Middlehury and Iteiinington, will
prohahly remain open until the militia
of Vermont reaches its full war
strength, recruits helng received at
Fort Kthan Allen. Only 1!.". or!') men
have taken the oath at the three sta
tions irr addition to about 10 at tbe fort
since the new period of recruiting be
gan. No information has come to
headquarters so far that the stations
would he discontinued, and there is no
reason for doing so as long as the regi
ment is not at its full war quota.
Reports published Sunday In New
York newspapers to the effect that
there are 2oi men in Vermont under
training may have been true several
weeks ago. hut arc not true today.
There are close to ?i)f) enlisted men not
including Officers at the fort. The fig
ures given for the total number of the
state militia in the state or on thehor
der must also be revised. There are
more than 91!) men of the national
guard in Vermont or at the Mexican
fron:
When the Second reglirjent left for
the front it contained 1L' companies of
which few were completely equipped.
This was a common condition and led
to the war department's order that
equlppmcnt henceforth must be com
plete in the cast' ol e ach aifd every and
every company. Left behind were the
skeleton units which since have been
Increased to minimum size .by aband
oning the cavaliy companies and en
listing them as infantry. The head

plete unit. An ordinary Infantry com
pany has a war strength of 110 men.

Washington, Aug. 15. The burden
of concession today apparently shift

threatened strike.
The managers were in session with
President Wilson for one and oir-hali
hours this forenoon. At the conclus

panies had eased to concede an eight

President Wilson stated that there
had been a candid exchange of views
at the conference but he was in no
position to mako any definite an
nouncement. The president had arranged for a
conference with the representatives of
the employes' organizations at
o'clock thi3 afternoon.
Washington. Aug. 16. President
Wilson conferred yesterday with both
parties to the threatened country-wide
railway Strike, and last night it ap
peared that sufficient foundation had
been laid to furnish a working basis
for a settlement of the differences of
the employes and employers.
The foremost questions ore. what
shall he arbitrated, it arbitration is to
he resorted to, and what form ot ar
bitiutiou shall be adopted. Repre
sentatives of the employes maintain
that their demand for an eight hour
day and time and a iralf for overtime
is the only concrete propostlon und. r
discussion. They insisted to the pres
ident in their conference yesterday
that the railroad 1 make some definite
counter proposal. If the railroads sub
nilfted some proposed form of settle
merit, they said, they would e ready
to discuss negotiations further. The
employes are understood to be ready
to consent to the principle of arbi
tration If the contingent proposals
of the managers which the men claim
involves rights they hae won In I!')
years' effort, are eliminated from con
siderailor), and If arbitration Is con
dm ted by a board on which all four
brotherhoods are represented.
Immediately after learning the cm
plows' position, the president sum
moned the committee of managers arid
held a long conference with them
I Iiey lert tne While House to comer
among themselves throughout the
night, if necessary, and the general
understanding was that they discussed
the advisability of withdrawing their
"contingency'' proposals and submit
ting a proposition "without strings,'
as demanded by the men.
While representatives of the em
pit yes insisted that they had not yet
agreed to arblttrate. any feature of
their differences, there was a grow
nig impression mat arbitration, or
some form of compromise would bt
agreed upon At no time. It whs said
Old the representatives .f the m n
indicate that unless their demand
were grnnted unqualifiedly they WOl)l
go on strike. Poth sides refused abs
lately to discuss their meeting ith
the president or venture any foroCASl
on the probable outcome jjf th
iicimtlath ns. but leaders of the two
factions were optimistic last ni
that a strike would be avoided.

under no circumstances will the om
pioyes a'jree to at lut i .it ;on 'iiio. r i ,e
New lands act. The hoards of nrht
trillion provided by that act, they main
tain, are too small. The balance ol
power, they contend, is too close and
as a result the employes haw: sni
fored. Indications were that the
president, recognizing this situation,
might propose a special board of ar-
bltration if the negotiations: reach the

FRANKLIN SCOTT
Wall-Known Patent Attorney Difd at
North Bennington Monday.
Franklin Scott of North Pennington
passed away at 7 a. m., Monday, Air
guest rath on the morning of bis 78th
birthday. He had been in tailing
health for some time, but the end
came suddenly following a three day's
illness caused by uremic poisoning.
.Mr. Scott was born, August 14,
1838, in the town of Pennington, on a
farm tamt a mile north of what is
now the property of the Vermont Sol
diers' home. In the early forties his
parents, Martin Billings Scott and
Mary Ann Olin. removed to North
Pennington, and he received his early
education in the common schools of
the town. After preparing for college
at one of the leading academic
schools of the day, in Port Edward, N.
Y he decided to study law, and en
tered the office of his cousin, Con
gressrnan Abraham Olin. in Troy. He
was admitted to the bar in Albany, lor
Hie practice of law in the New York
state courts. About this time Con
gressman Olin removed to Washing
ton, D. C and Mr. Scott entered the
offices of Judges Tracy and Komayne,
natent lawvers of Troy. Here he lost
his interest for the practice of com
mon law, and took up patent law anil
patent soliciting. He was later ad
mitted to practice in the United States
courts in Washington, 1). C, New
York, Massachusetts and Vermont.
He was not only a patent lawyer,
hut was considered an expert in an
alyzing mechanical patents, and cases
were frequently sent to him by promi
nent attorneys from various parts of
tbe country, for his examination and
idvice as to the mechanical construc
tion of patents. Among the great
numbers who submit work to the pat-
nt offices at Washington, he was Con-
ded to he unequalled irr his skill not
only as a draftsman, but as a penman.
rbomaa A. Kdison at one time
chanced to see a little sketch or a
sphere, made by Mr. Scott, which only
m braced three lines, hut so shaded
that it was perfect. Mr. Kdison hunt-
d him up. and induced him .to enter
his employ as head of his drawing de
partment, w hich position ne near ior
several years.
Mr. Scott was a shrewd politician,
and in his earlier days, when mak
ing public addresses, his keen wit, and
ready grasp of the situation, seldom
failed to have the desired influence on
his audience.
On the Scott side of the family, he
wa- a direct descendant or i ipwq
Stephen Pay, and on his mother's side.
was especially proud of the fact.
that he was directly descended from
Joseph Haviland. Tory, who was the
first settler In the town of Penning
ton, building a log cabin on a piece ot
ground which is now the eost portion
of A. S. Hathaway's lawn on West
street only a few feet from the spot
where Mr. Scott died. lib ancestors
were Quakers, ami when asked about
his religloiis belief, he always replied
that he was a Quaker by heredity.
In 1S71 lie returned to North Pen
nington where he has since resided
with his sister. Knilly Walbridge
Scott, who survives him. Pour others
of the Immediate relatives survive
Mrs. William Hull, a niece, daughter
oi" the late Henry Scott, and her
daughter. Vera L. Hull, also two
grand-nephews, Martin W. and Prank
11 Scott, all of Pennington.
Mr. Scott will be missed In tho com
munlty. It is with sadness that wi
see the older residents departing OBt
by one and realize how few remain to
us of that generation. During the long
years of his residence In the town
none ot the poorer. omnion people
have ever appealed to him for advice
in vain, und their loyal testimony to
that effect Is one of the most gratify
ing tributes which his family have to
cherish of his memory.
The burial services will be held
from his Into hnme. Thursday at " p.
mH and the interment will be in the
family plot In the cemetery at Obi
Iteiinington.
