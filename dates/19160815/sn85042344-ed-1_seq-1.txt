The Rech. in (ts summary of tho

1,7".0 officers were raptured and 69
guns and 342 machine guns and
bonb-throwers taken by Generals
Itohitzky, Scherbatchoff and Sak
haroff. No change took place Monday along
either the British or French lines In
France, bad weather hindering the op
erations which were confined almost
exclusively to artillery duels. Ac
cording to Parlin the British have
been expelled from trenches over a
front of seven hundred yards soutn
west of the Thiepval-Por.ieres sector
which they occupied Sunday. On the
Isonzo front, according to Rome, the
Italians have mado still further ad
vances against the Austrians along
the Carso platen and east of Hill

of trenches was penetrated and more
men taken prisoners. In the Qorlzla
sector Rome says the Austrian guns

Kalians. Here, according to Vienna,
seven charges bv the Italians were
put down by .the Austrians.

as to whether the deeds prompted
the workings of an unbalanced mind

LAW USELESS,
AVERS HUGHES
Proposed Legislation X
Worth the Paper It is
Printed on.
SAYS DEMOCRATS
CANNOT PROTECT
Tells Spokane People It Is
Full of Meaningless
Words Alone.
SPoKANK. Wash, Au'. H.
Charles K. lluglies tonight told an
audience in Spokane's stadium that
the proposed I H-niocratlc legislation
against the dumping of foreign-made
goods In this country arter the war
was not worth the paper on which
It was written.
"This piece of legislation", Mr.
Hughes said, "would lei bout as
available as the piece ..f paper I hold
In my hand, In effect, in protecting
American people In the economic war
that will come when peine comes to
Ku rope,"
Mr. Hughes read a synopsis of tho
proposed legislation. The Demoratiu
party, be said, was not equal to tho
task of protecting American industries
by a tariff.
"If yn want to see vih.it they are
equal to," ho said, "read the anti
dumping clause they put In tho rev
enue bill.
"I shall not read It in full. You
would need to sit down und put a
towel around your head, get down
close to it and study It, read over
again und again and then you would
h puzzled to know what it meant.
If you found out what it meant you
would agree with me that it was
obviously ineffective and would not
work.
"Now what would a prosecuting at
torney have to prove h-sj a vlcdution of
this act?" Mr. Hughes continued utter
ending the synopsis.
"Ho has got to prove that this act
of commonly and systematically
bringing goods Into this country con
trary to their proh hltloii is being vio
lated. Ho has got to prove that such
act is duno with the intent to destroy
or injure any industry of the United
Slates. If he does no prove that ho
has got to prove It Is for the purpose
or preventing the establishment of an
industry In the I'nited Sattea or for
tho purpose of restraining any part of
tho commerce of the I'nited States.
Mitt Worth I'iiot.
"Why, that is a piece of legislation
that would he about as available as
that piece of paper in my hand, in
(fleet. In protecting the American
people In this economic wur.
"Now there was a remedy, a
countervailing duty which was pro
Kiwd but our friends were so strong
to their traditions of tariff for reve
nue only tliut thev would have none
of it.
"I am desirous that this matter of
the ti'illf should be attended to with
out pbuse. I do not propose simply
becaise I am a candidate for office
to seek office under false pretenses.
I am a candidate and a good Repub
lican, but if I am olee'ed I shall cn
c'luvor to the best of iny ability to
see (hat principle applied for the pub
lic got d and not for private gain."
