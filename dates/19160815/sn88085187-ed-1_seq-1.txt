"All he could any was that 4

One railway official, leaving |
the White House said:

A NOTE TO
MR. HUGHES
Mr. Hughes;
Ten or twenty thousand of us are going to the Sta
dium this afternoon to hear and see you.
Naturally enough, we shall be weighing nnd measur
ing you. W> shall be rather critical of how you act and
what you say. And of how you say it.
We feel, and, 1 am sure, you feel, that this is right
and proper. For you are coming to us as one seeking
the leadership of the most powerful nation on earth for
lour years that doubtless will he among the most critical
in the republic's history.
During your six hours' 6tay in our city you will be
estimating us, trying to feel the temper of this people,
hoping to catch a breath of our hopes and wishes and
aspirations.
The ten or twenty thousand i us that you
will face in our cement horseshoe will be a per
fectly representative audience—representative
of all Southwest Washington.
The hundred persons that possihly you will
converse with during; your flying visit will not
he |H«rf«»a'tly representative. The »liMlf dozen
with ivhom you may intimately discuss politics
timing your slay will he even lews so.
It is for that reason that I am thus trying to express
to you the feelings of the ten or twenty thousand, for
otherwise you might gain a perverted idea of Southwest
Washington's views.
These people place the value of human life and hap
piness and well-being far above the dollar or anything
the dollar can buy. They want a president with a warm
heart as well as a clear brain.
They love democracy and progress- Note that they
have written Into their state law woman suffrage, work
men's compensation, prohibition, initiative, referendum,
recall, minimum wage, direct primaries.
They are typical westerners. They love a man who
is fearless and aggressive—provided he uses his fearless
ness and his aggressiveness on the side of the people.
They know that actions speak louder than words.
These Southwest Washington people are highly non
partisan. They have no respect for party bosses, no
veneration for |>arty names and shibboleths. They will
not tolerate a leader who places party first and country
second.
Neither have they any tolerance for shackling tech
nicalities, for precedent that blocks progress, for red tape
that stifles free action.
In brief, Mr. Hughes, the people of Southwest Wash
ington are thoroughly progressive. The reactionary they
will not follow nor heed. THE EDITOR.
The author, inspiration, found
er and high mogul of the Whis
kers club is in town today.

When tbe sunlight sparkled on

that, was them.
While Charles Evans Hughes

Whiskers clubbers, take heed. Al

But bark! While Charlie I*
talking in favor of Hughe* for
president, in the distance Is heard
the sighing of wind whistling
through the underbrush of anoth
er famous member.
Fighting whisker for whisker,
comes the fiery faced J. Hamilton
Lewis, hot on Charlie's trail,
swinging around the political cir
cle, talking against Hughes for
president.
Everywhere Hughes' whiskers
go, J. Ham's will follow In an
orgy of pin feathered oratory.
Whisker* divided against them
selves cannot stand. Somebody!*
got to be the goat.
If the campaign Is to be won
by the cutest haymow, the finish
promises to be exciting. J. Ham

Washington. Charles has been
coddling his all the way out to the
coast.

MAYOR ABOLISHES
FEE FOR FARMERS
Mayor Fawcetf announced to
the council Tuesday that he had
given orders prohibiting further
charge of inspection fee to farm
ers and ranchers whose meat Is
Inspected by the health depart

"I did not know that the de
partment was charging a fee un
til a few days ago," explained the
mayor.
"The inspectors had collected

The G.O.R Nominee As Campaigner
SENATOR
WAS NOT
INVITED
In spite of the fact that nine
prominent Tacoma republicans
sent a telegram to Presidential
Candidate Charles E. Hughes at
Spokane Monday calling attention
to the fact that the republican
national committeeman of Taco
ma had ignored sending Senator
Poindexter an invitation to ac
company the Hughes party
through Washington, Poindexter
jdid not travel to Tacoma with tl»e
candidate's party.
Republican leaders who accom
panied Hughes across the state
said that the telegram was ".ill
bunk," but none of them would
assert that Poindexter had been
Invited.
"Senator Poindexter was on the
platform at Spokane yesterday,"
said Republican State Chairman
Millard T. Hartson at the Tacoma
hotel Tuesday.
"I asked him if he were com
ing west, and he mid that he was. i
I had no power to Invite him to
accompany the Hughes party, but
I naturally imagined that he was
coming."
It was learned in Tueoma
today that Sentor Poindex
ter was ignored In the plans
for Hughes' trip through
Washington, but that the
senator found himself a place
m* the Spokane platform and
sat there uninvited so far as
the national committeeman
was concerned.
Several stund-pat republican*
at the Tacoma hotel reception
Tuesday commented unfavorably
on the republican committeeman's
deliberate failure to Invite the
Washington senator.
