Board of Curators Will Hold
Special Meeting Here
Monday.
President A Ross Hill said today
that a special meeting of the Hoard
of Curators would be held here net
Monda to consider the financial prob
lem of the University.
Federal aid given the University for
agricultural extension under the
Smith-Lever grant carries with it the
assumption that the state will ap
propriate the same amount as paid
hj the government President Hill
said that unless the state could pa
its appropriation Missouri would lose
its share of the federal allowance.
All the St. Louis newspapers es
tcrd.iv. printed accounts of the Uni
versity financial situation, based on
an interview given in St. Louis by
President Hill.
Doctor Mill explained what has
been generally known in Columbia
the fact that the state treasury is be
hind in its pavment of the funds ap
propriated to the University by the
legislature. To meet current ex
penses, he said, $S3,000 has been ad
vanced bj it. II Price, president of
the lioonc County National Hank and
treasurer of the University. During
the last three months the University,
lie said, has received no money from
the state except a small amount from
the inheritance tax fund.
State Treasurer Edwin I Deal, who
was In St Louis last night, is quoted
Iij the Republic as saving that his of
fice had honored every warrant pre
sented, and ho was at a loss to know
win warrants for the salaries of
teachers had not been issued by the

STATE MEETING HERE
President of Association Gives
Columbia Women Credit
for Good Work.
M.U. DEAN IN TALK
W. W. Charters Outlines
Changes in Theory and
Practice of Education.
The hand that rocks th? ciadle rul
ed Columbia last night when about four
hundiul motheis and teachers met in
tlie Christian ( oilcgc Auditorium for
the opening session of the fourth an
nual convention of tlie Missouri Con
gress of Mothers and Parent-T aclier
Associations.
Plenty of enthusiasm was shown at
the meeting in fact, plent of ev en
tiling, except men, who, according to
Dean W. W. Charters, were at home
taking care of tha babies. A glance
over the audience revealed the ma or
of Columbia, one insurance agent, two
doctors, one minister and the speaker
of tlie evening, D.an Charters of the
cool of Education of the University.
Mrs. Frank G. Harris of Columbia
gave an addrtss of welcome on behalf
of the mothers of Columbia, and Mrs.
J. H IcHnde of Springlield, presi
dent of the Missouri Congress of
Mothers, responded. She said that
Columbia had done more than an
othtr tit in Missouri toward the ac
complishment of tlie aims set forth in
the slogan of the organization, "Make
.Missouri a better place for children."
fellows 15 Ic.irs of Changes.
Dean Charters, in his address on "A
Silent Revolution," gave a history of
the change that has takn place tn
public education 111 the last fifteen
tars. lie said that the old idea of
tae function of the public school could
best he shown by a letter which
Susie's mother wrote to the teacher:
"Dear teacher," it read, "1 am not
ittling well this week, and 111 addition
1 am going to have company. Please
teac li Susie her lessons and kt me
hear them, instead of having me teach
Susie the lessons and letting ou hear
them."
".Many criticisms of tlie public
stliool sstem of tod.i are being made
b magazines and educators," said
Dean Charters, "but the best way to
answer the objections is to compare
present witli past methods. For in
stance, in tlie matter of methods of
discipline: The stories that my moth
er told and the things that I remember
about tlie discipline in the public
schools of tweny-hve ears ago are
harrowing, to say the least. Military
discipline was the rule, and a day that
passed without Hogging at least ten
pupils was a da ill spent. Today the
complaint is that children are not
whipped enough especiall other peo
ple's children."
"Lack of Interest 11 Wtlijrl.."
Dean Charters then traced the
changes that had come about in the
teaching of beginning reading, in the
use of tlie factor of play. In the in
stallation of language as a study and
in tlie attention to the rules of hy
giene. He said that the only serious
setback in the movement for better
ment of the public schools was the
lack of interest shown "by parents In
general. He said he hoped that the
Congress of Mothers would be the
forte to bridge this gap in tlie rela
tion between the parents and the pub
lic schools.
After the meeting a reception was
held in the drawing rooms of Christian
College. In the receiving line were:
Mrs. J. H. Mcliride, Springfield: Mrs.
Norman Windsor, St. Ixmis; Mrs. W.

Suggestions for Rearing Children.
"Let the children do things that ap
peal to them," said Miss Dobbs. "Ar
range work so that it appeals to them
and ou will not have to ask them to

Remember the vagueness of a child's
mind and don't forget that a little one
has not the same intelligence ou

for raising a child."
