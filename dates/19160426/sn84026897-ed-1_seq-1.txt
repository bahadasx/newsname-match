Southern Always Alert and
Active.
Chattanooga, Tenn., April 18.
With the view of pxtendincr their
efforts to promote the sale of soath
ern made goods in the South Amer
ean countries, Southern Railway,
Queen and Crescent Route, and the
Mobile and Ohio Railroad, will
send their South American Agent,
Mr. Charles Lyon Chandler, on a
tour through South America this
summer. He will leave in .Tulv and
visit Brazil, Argentina and Urugu
ay,- where the opportunities are now
particularly bright for.'extension of
American trade because of the Eu
ropean War. Mr. Chandler made
a similar trip last year.
Mr. Chandler will interview the
merchants and buyers of the th ive
republics and investigate trade op
portunities generally in order to be
able to advise southern merchants
and manufacturers where and how
to place their products to the great
est advantage. While on this
trip, his services will be at the dis
posal of Southern firms who are
anxious to have specific trade op
portunities investigated for them,
and will also be criad to assist and
promote their trade there in any
way possible. Firms desiring Mr.
Chandler to represent them should
address them at 322 James Build
ing, Chattanooga. No charge will
be made for this service, the work
being part of the Southern's gen
eral scheme for developing the
South.
"There is a particularly gool
market for Southern cotton goods
in Argentina and Uruguay at the
present time," declares Mr. Chand
ler, "and over ?10.000,000 worth of
colton fabrics, piece goods, both
bleached and colored, could be sold
to Argentine Republic alone from
the Southern States. We only ex-1
pori ?28,000,000 worth of cotton j
piece goods annually while our ex
ports of automobiles amount to
??.%CUlUr000. rhe-Sonth Anwijsansrj '
are now looking to the United
States for manufactured goods and
other products necessary in their
ever" day life, and there is no rea
son why the South should not get a
full share of the business if it is
sought in the proper way."
Average Value of Horses and
Mules.
Auditor J. R. Tiraraerman has
just completed an abstract of the
personal property of Edgefield coun
ty to be forwarded to the Tax Com
mission in Columbia, and he has
given us the following figures which
show the average value at wiiicii
horses and mules are returned for
taxation in the different townships:
Horses Mules]

A study of the above figures will
show that the assessed values in sev

horses and mules both averaging
higher in that township than in any

Swat the Fly!
(Published by request.)
Oh, my!
Swat the fly.
Hit him low,
Him him high;
Swat him on the head,
Bat him in the eye.
Kill him good, kill him dead.
Watch him till you see bim die.
Ile is nasty, he is bad,
He is loathsome, he is mean.
Use the swatter as a fad,
And keep your eatables clean.
If you have a stable
And you're strong and able,
Clean it out every week
And keep your family from get
ting sick.-Christian Advocate.
HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Wind and Dry Weather With
out Precedent. Easter Ser
vice at Dothan Church.
New Cars Galore.
Easter has come and gone and
we did not freeze either. Saturday
the wind was real cold all day. Bot
although the wind blew a gale all
day it. was a li ot wind. And every
thing is so very dry.
Some one wa? telling me in Au
gusta Saturday that the lakes in
Florida are drying up from such ex
tended dry weather and so much
wind. It seems to strike every one
with the same idea that they never
remember having so muca wtind and
dry weather. I very much fear we
will have a very wet summer and
the grass will take possession of
the crops if it ever comes up during
the dry spell. The men talk crops
and politics now and how much the
grain needs rain as well as other
things.
Ladies want rain for their gar
dens. This is also their season for
vying with each other in the chick
en crop. The crows are breaking up
hen's nests and eating eggs equal to
the dogs.
Mrs. G. \V. M ed lock had bad
luck with her chickens, lost so
many from cholera and now Mrs.
Georgia Mulvie is losing hers with
it. We have been threatened with
it several times in our flock, but fed
saltz, sulphur and soda in dough
aud put carbolic acid, permanganate
of potash and turpentine in the
drinking water, and have not lost
more than three. Those we bumed.
We have a good many, over a hun
dred off. Some of our neighbors
tell us they have 12, some none.
Sunday, Easter, was service day
over at Dothan and we saw Mr. and
Mrs. McKie Scott a o up to attend
services. Also Mr. Philip Markert
aud family ero up- in their new car
to attend Dothan. Mrs. Georgia
McKie carried Mrs. Frances Townes
to service in Augusta in her new
car.
Mr. and Mrs. George Townes and
baby spent Sunday with ?Mrs. Julia
Towues returning to Aiken in the
afternoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bunch and
children spent an hour or so with
.Mrs. S. V. Hunch Sunday afternoon.
She is feeling very badly, still. Mr.
Harry Hunch is quite unwell and
the children have all been right
sick during the past week.
We attended the woman's mis
sionary meeting at Mrs. Frances
Townes last Thursday afternoon
and enjoyed it very much.
Mrs. Julia Townes and Mrs. T.
J. Btiggs attended the meeting at
Aiken and gave us some very inter
esting accounts of what interest
ed them most at that meeting. Both
were very much impressed by Mrs.
Tillman's great ability and gracious
manner of carrying out her points,
and conducting tile meeting. Just as
every one is obliged to be with that
lovely christian lady.
We were glad to have Miss Em
mie Lanham with us also at our
meeting. She had attended the Ai
ken meeting as well as visiting Miss
Georgia Reese, over at the bunga
lo with Mr. John Reese.
Mr. Luther Reese has been hav
ing chills but we are glad to see
him out again. Miss Georgia hopes
to get out of the reach of the ma
laria by going to stay with Mr.
John Reese awhile.
The Gard nervi lie school children
had an Easter egg hunt cn Good
Friday and enjoyed it immensely.
Some two young men on their way
home from town ran into Miss Be
atrice Stevens' buggy as she and the
teacher, Miss Birmes Harker, were
going home from the egg hunt and
tore Miss Stevens' buggy and one
of the young men in the car up
pretty badly. Fortunately I did not
hear of any one being hurt.
The Sweetwater memorial servic
es will be held this year, second
Sunday in May. Every one is invit
ed to come prepared for all day
services, and enjoyable time.
Next Sunday being fifth Sunday
the union meetiiiir convenes at Re
hoboth and we wish so much it
were possible for us to be there
with all those good, hospitable peo
ple. Hut we cannot make the trip
in one day with Balam and have no
automobile. Guess we will be at
home, thinking of those who will
go and enjoy it.

RED OAK GROVE.
Corn Up and Plowed. Fishing
Favorite Sport. Easter Egg
Hunt. Approaching
Marriage.
Oar farm or? seem to have gotten
their business where t hey can feel at
?easure somewhat. Mu?h corn has
been planter!, some of the corn has
been plowed and good stands re
ported. Cotton the uncertain Kins:
of the South, is coming too. "I
did not know what was best," re
marked one of our neighbors, in
reference to several loads of guano
he'was having placed on his farm.
The above remark doubtless ex
pressed the sentiment of many hard
laboring, honest farmer. In that
adventure, as in all things, we can
be made satisfied, by trusting in
Him who knows our needs better
than we do. Amen to the farmer.
Last Saturday Messrs. O O. Tim
merman and J. T. Grittis took sev
eral .young people down to Stevens
Creek to tish. Whether the wind was
too high or a preference of "Dry
land" fishing prevented a real tish
dinner, we do not know how that
was, but however having had suffi
cient experience in the uncertainty
of either satisfying the appetite of
a party on occasions like that a nice
lunch was provided and spread for
the enjoyment of all.
Preferring the amusement of
the children, rather than fishing,
Misses Kathleen Kendrick and Ber
tha Parkman gave an Easter hunt
at Mr. Charlie Park man's for quite
a happy little crowd, on last Sat
urday p. m. No prizes this time
were offered they said, but we had
so much real fun ourselves, we hope
to dd more n?xt unie for the chil
dren.'
Several from our town spent the
dayfirear Modoc on Savannah river.
Among thera Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Lan^?fM^asre. Mallie -Clegg, Al
bert Shelton and Frank Kenrick.
Notwithstanding the unfavorable
conditions for fishing, a number
went over on the Georgia side.
Falling from the boat was made
quite interesting. The champion
.vork of the day, by Mr. Tillman
Mowle. Mr. Clegg was happiest
his only haul being a large carp,
he bj the side of his fiah ]ay dor
mant till dinner was announced,
and upon that announcement, |,e de
clared the day a success. Down by
the river-side among the stately cot
ton-wood trees and lovely willows,
on the carpet of bermuda grass was
spread a spotlessly white cloth -
bearing just the things that we
find provided on all well regulated
farms, making a scvne of a most
lasting impression. But back of I '
this?pread was the sweetest picture. I<
A happy home, despite affliction,
ruled by an affectionate fattier, a
kind and untiring mother, who so
graciously provided this lunch for
our pleasure. We feel under last
ing obligations to Mr. and Mrs.
John Robertson Jr., and Mr. and
Mrs. Tillman Howie for their many
courtesies extended us on this en
joyable trip.
The expenditure of thousands of
dollars by the Twin-City Power
Company makes the possibilities
seem most a reality to greater things
for McCormick county. A railroad
track has been built, which will
make industrial iesources easy, that
now lie quiescent, many induce
ments are there and will some day
come to light. Price's Island three
miles in length belonging to this
corporation, could be used to many
advantages. What is more useful
or a greater advantage than a good
stock farm. Nature has done much
for man-kind everywhere.
Mr. Will Rogers from Birming
ham, Ala., where'he holds a respon
sible position, accompanied by Mr.
Hallie Clegg from Callisou, visited
relatives here last week.
Misa Ettie Wates who has been
teaching near McCormick and has
been eiected to teach next school

Mr. Ja?k Ripley Drowned in
Turkey Creek.
Fridav afternoon Messrs. Joe and
Gregg Fagan and Messrs. Jack Rip
ley, Sr.. and Jack Ripley, Jr., .vent
on a fishing expedition to Turk ev
creek, pitching their tent about half

When they returned about dark
