Morris is easily the master of them 1

as a former prosecuting attorney of \

With the enormous expense to the;1

Jurors, suitor's and witnesses that 1
our criminal court is reaching, and 1
the stubborn defense to criminal
cases being made by the attorney of t
our local bar which is recognized as S
of the best in the country, it is most c
important that the state should have i
the very best lawyer available as its i
prosecuting attorney of our great[
