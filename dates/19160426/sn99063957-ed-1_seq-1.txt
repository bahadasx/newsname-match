GERMANS CLAIM LATTER
CARRY WAR MUNITIONS
The Fact That Many American
Businessmen Are Leaving
Is Suggestive
By Carl W. Ackennan.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, April 20. Imperial Chancel
lor Von Bethmami-Holhveg and Ad
miral Von Holtzendorff arrived today
lit Knisor Wilheim s field headquarters
for an ull important conference con
cerning the crisis in German-American
relations. Von Hollvveg is expected hack
in Berlin by the week-end, perhaps
with a rough draft of the German reply
to American submarine demands.
The split in newspaper ranks over
the submarine issue was more pro
nounced today. The Vossichc Zeitung
led that liortion of the press urging
the presedvntion of friendly relation
lin me l. u i i hi mines.
On the other hand Count Reventlow
in his writings demanded that no furth
er eoicessions bo made, arguing that if
war results from this stand and the
United States seized interned Germnn
Bhips, the German victory will more
than restore these losses. If beaten in
ihe war, Reventlow argued that Ger
many would lose as many ships as there
-tire now in American ports nuywt.y.
Berlin, April 20. President Wilson';:
demands that submarines warn freight
vessels as well as liners before attack
ing them is a most serious obstacle in
the path of ah amicable settlement of
the German-American dispute, the Uni
ted Press learned today on good auth
ority. Other points nt issue may be
disposed of without danger of a diplo
matic rupture. But strong opposition
is felt to safeguarding the crews of
freighters, since practically every en
emy freighter is engaged almost solely
in carrying munitions to the nllies.
There is a growing feeling, however
that there will be no German-American
break. It is still too earlv to say that
the crisis lias passed. The situation
apparently depends upon the firmness
of President Wilson 's stand. Matters
are awaitinc Imperial Chancellor Von
Bcthmnnn-Hollweg's return from his
second conference with the kaiser. He
has reported to the kaiser his conversa
tion of Monday with Ambassador Ger
ard, in which he sought to learn tin
exact conditions with which Germany
must comply in order to satisfy the
president.
Prominent Germans talked with Vo.
Ibdlweg after his conference with Ger
ard, and one of the most distinguished,
said luter that the best German forces
were attempting to reach a satisfactory
understanding and that they would be
Biii'ccssful unless Washington weighed
Germany's position too lightly.

lie declares there is no intention among
democratic leaders to abandon any leg
islation. All major matters will be
fought through to a finish, he said.
This program is contradictory to one
which has genernllv been understood
to be favored by tho president.
The legislation which will take a
great deal of time, it is expected in
cludes: The navy bill, all appropriation bills,
all the revenue bills, ship purchase
bill, Tiirsil credits, immigration, child
labor and other measures.
Prolonged fights, perhaps filibusters,
are practical -certainties in the ship
purchase and child labor bills.
liural credits will be the next legis
lation to be considered by the senate.
A large amount of conservation leg
islation, including bills for water pow
er, mining and grazing lands still in
public domain, will also be considered,
but probably not enacted into law be
cause of differences between the two
houses.
