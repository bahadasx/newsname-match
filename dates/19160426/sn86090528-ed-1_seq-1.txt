In she vanors of the brain of Conan
1,'oyiu, has nothing on J. W. Owsley,
of thickaHlia, U. S. A.
Last night there wandered into the
Jewelry emporium of Mr. Owsley two
youths of hobo appearance and ap
proached him upon the subject of dia
mond rings. Before taking his dia
monds from his Btrong box Mr. Ows
ley looked askance upon the raiment
of the youths. He gazed appraisingiy
u.K!i the rough and ready junipers
v hich encased the torsa of each, and
at the ragged regimentals which en
closed the four legs of the Deeming
heroes. Following the scrutiny Mr.
O.-slcy asked:
"Wouldst buy, gay and festive Sir
huiglUH of the road? Wouldst thou
become, through the, medium of barter
anil fcjf liango, the owuers of some of
the line carbons now owned by me?"
And the elder of the two youths
Idled, in words and figures of speech
to tne effect that purchase they
' w ouldst" not,
"We would sell," quoth the elder and
the more tramp like of the, twain.
"Produce, thou, the sparkler and a
price I will quote tliee," said fcher
locko, nee Owsley.
And from beneath the folds of the
dirty Jumper oi by the. younger of
the diamond merchants, a diamond of
tmall but scintillating water was
drawn.
Mr. Owsley examined the stone and
then he offered the diamond mer
chants, as u feeler, 3 for the stone.
The offer was accepted. The five
spot and the shiner changed hands,
Mr. Owsley takiniJ a receipt. The
shiner was double-locked in OwsICy's
Jewel va"ult and the merchants depart
ed in search of a place where they
might unload the coin. j
And Mr. Owsley, the Jeweler, ceased
to be while Sherlocko, the detective,
came Into being. Down the avenue
and across and over and along side
titreets Sherlocko trailed and traced
the merchants until the trailing
brought Into sight the barley unform
ed form of Patrolman Baird. Sher
locko approached tho blue-chid law's
officer. lie told him fully of the
transaction. "Take them into thy
palpitating tnltts, Mr. Officer," re
quested Sherlocko, "they came not by
that sparkler in an honest manner.'
And Officer Iiaird gathered the
Wandering Willies Into tho fold and
escorted them to the police station
and deposited them In the strong box
in the rear thereof.
This morning the delinquent, other

Wright's story was to the effect that
he was a hobo; that a Dock Island
crew ditched him at Mihco; that he
hoofed it from Minco to rocasset;
that in Pocasset he met the "kid;"
that from I'ocasset the two came to
Chickasha on tho rattlers; that he
helped the kid sell the ring but that
he did not know it had been stolen.
Judge Coffman. however, believed
the young boy's story and fined
Wright $2j and turned him over to
the county for further action.
'I do not think the little follow is ;
naturally depraved," said Judge Coff
man this morning, "therefore I am go- i
ing to give him a chance, so far a's
lies in my power. I am going to turn
him over to Dan Iteets, the street com
missioner, and to Sergeant Looney.
He may rustlo around the station for
a short time until I satisfy myself that
he is a good kid and then I am going
to send him to his father at Cot an
che." And now, through the Sherlock
Holmes act of Mr. Owsley, Wright,
tho hobo, is in the county jail, while
through the emulation, by tho mayor,
of the manner in which King Soloman
was wont, years Bgo, to try cases,
Freeman is getting his chance.
