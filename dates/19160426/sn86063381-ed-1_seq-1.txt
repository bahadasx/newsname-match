from England and have occupied
the heart of Dublin. Martial law
has been declared in Dublin

extended beyond Dublin, where
members of the Sinn Fein so
ciety on Monday captured the

treated, doing little damage.
Little Fighting.
London, April 26.Excepting in
Loraine, there has been an entire
absence of infantry fighting on the
western front. The big guns, how
ever, have continued their rain of
shells in opposing poositions at var
ious points.
At Lacchapelotte in Loraine, the
Germans launched a heavy infantry
attack against the French which was
repulsed. Some of the Germans ob
tained a footing in a portion of the
French salient, but were later driven
out with heavy losses.

of Esnes and Cumieres, northwest of
Verdun, the bombardment continued
intent. To the east of Verdun around
Moulainville, there also has been a
violent bombardment. In the Ar

four German machines were brought
down, is reported by Paris.

sanguinary losses. Heavy artillery
engagaments are still in progress on
the upper Cordevole and Monte San
Michele zones of the Austro-Italian

Turkish pickets.

son's demand that German submar
ines warn freighters constitutes the
most serious obstacle in the way of
a satisfactory settlement of German
American relations, the United Press
learned authoritatively today. Other
points will possibly be settled but of
ficials are convinced that freighters
are carrying allies' munitions.

EDITOR FILES FOR
REPRESENTATIVE
Sam S. Sherman of the Northern
light of Williams Files for
State Office.
Sam S. Sherman, editor of the
Northern Light of Williams has filed
for representative to the legislature
from this district.
In a letter to County Auditor
George, Sherman writes: "Should
I be so fortunate as to be chosen, I
would go down to St. Paul with a
bunch of bills in my pocket and say
to my conferees, 'here are some of
the measures that I want enacted in
to law, because they are worthy and
shoudl become laws, and ready at all
times to stand up on the floor and
defend them and let each one take
its chances, backed up by the best
effort I could make in its behalf. I
should not 'pussyfoot for any meas
ure and swap my vote for everything
that came up in exchange for a vote
for my pet measure, regardless cf
whether there was merit of disre
pute in the other fellow's bill."
Mr. Sherman in his letter states
that he believes in salary readjust
ment for county officials, that county
commissions should be put on a sal
ary basis, drainage laws should be
amended, fish laws amended "so that
settlers along lakes and streams
would have an equal chance with for
eign corporations," that efforts for
the enforcement of the "Indian
treaty" should discontinue and coun
ty option be given a chance.
Representative L. G. Pendergast of

when the tide was out. When
