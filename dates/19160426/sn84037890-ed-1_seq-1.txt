REDISPOSITIijF SOLDIERS
Quiets Rumor Of Withdrawal
Will Police the Territory
South Oi Border.
TURSUIT NOW AT STANDSTILL
Washington, April 24. Behind
the formal announcement to-dny
that President Wilson had approved
a plan for redlsposltion of the Amer
ican troops In Mexico, there was a
plain Intimation that the Washing
ton Government had determined to
maintain a military status quo be
yond the border until the Mexican
de facto Government has demon
strated Its ability to capture or
crush Villa and his adherents and
prevent repetitions of the Columbus
raid.
In the Interim It Is understood
the American troops will be so
placed as to safeguard the border
towns by virtually policing the area
south of the line, where Gen. Car
ranza has been heretofore unable to
check bandit operations.
Secretary Baker announced the
approval of the redlsposltion plan
after consulting with the President,
over a joint report submitted by
MaJ. Gen. Funston and Maj. Gen.
'Scott, Chief of Staff, in conference
on the border. The plan was pro
posed zy Gen. Funston and concur
red in by Gen. Scott. The Secretary
announced the Administration's de
cision as follows:
"Gen. Funston has recommended
a redlsposltion of the forces in Mex
ico for the purpose of recuperation
and pending opportunities for fur
- ther co-operation with the forces of
the de facto Government of Mexico,
The recommendation has been ap
proved and Its execution left to his
discretion."
Later the Secretary dictated the
following:
"The statement I have made indi
cate nothing whatever on the sub
ject of when the American troops
will be withdrawn from Mexico. The
whole subject of withdrawal of the
forces is under arrangement and ne
gotiation by tlio State Department."
Mr. Baker declined to say wheth
er Gen. Funston's recommendation
Inchided his previous suggestions
that the bolder base bo shifted from
Columbus, N. M., to Presidio, Tex.,
or some other point to the east of
Columbus in order to shorten the
line of communication. He stated
positively, however, that no addi
tional regiments had been ordered
to the border and that no such or
der was In contemplation. The Sec
retary mado it clear also that mili
tary officials of the Government
were not considering the question of
withdrawal from Mexico, tlmt mat
ter being wholly In the hands of the
State Department.
It was announced that Gen. Scott
had completed his mission to the
border and would return to Wash
ington in a few days.
The new military plan leaves tho
pursuit of Villa at a standstill, but
free3 Gen. Funston's hands to make
the posltlbu of tho forces in Mexico
secure by grouping them in posts of
such strength us to protect them
from nttack by Irresponsible ele
ments of the de facto government's
forces. It will also servo as a plain
warning to Gen, Carranza that ho
must bend ovory effort toward se
curing completo control of tho terri
tory south of tho most advanced
American post If lie hopes to have
troops recalled,

obtaining sufficient civilian median-
Ics. Half of tlio 7,000 had been re

leaves.
"It Is a measuro of preparedness,"
it was officially explained, "the ne
cessity of which was Increased by tlio
fact that wo have been handlcnpped
for months by a shortage of civilian
workmen and material. If wo are
to make these ships ready for sea at
an early notico repairs must be com
pleted soon, and It was found that
the only way to accomplish this was
to put the bluejackets to work."

about C.000 officers and men; ten

ican Troops Concerning
the Americans.
A STROXG IIAXDICAP IS ItORXE
Columbus, N. M April 22. Dis.
patches brought here from the front
in Mexico by an aviator show plain
ly the attitude of Mexicans toward
American soldiers.
This one was written April 15:
"American aeroplanes hae been
fired upon several times by Mexicans
and in at least one case the assail
ants were Carranza soldiers.
"The latter Instance was reported
by Lieutenant C. K. Chapman, who
flew Into camp this morning after an
absence of three days on what
should have been undnr normal con
ditlons a two hours' fllcht.
"Thiee nights ago, while on this
trip, wind and darkness forced Lieu
tenant Chapman to alight in tho
mountains about 20 miles from here.
He found a ranch In the hills where
the Mexicans seemed friendly. They
advised him to remain there over
night, declaring that the hills were
'full of Villa bandits.'
"He spent the night at the ranch
house without molestation, but the
next day, while near a town, with
his machine on the ground, a train
load of Carranza troops passed. Ap
parently for no other put pose than
to test their marksmanship, some of
these soldiers opened lire on tho
plane.
"The aviators have come to call
thi3 sort of thing 'giving us n little
party.' "
This one was written April 10:
"An American army officer was
fired upon this evening while pass
ing a small town near this camp in
company with a dispatch bearer.
The shooting was without effect. An
investigation wns made.
"A cavalry troop located the camp
of Candelaiio Cervantes, a Villa
Lieutenant, in the moutalns peine
miles from here. Apparently Cer-
vnntes's outposts were able to give
him word of the American approach.
He escaped. Seven horses were ta-
ken In the mountain camp,. Thieej
Mexicans found In that vicinity werej
brought, under custody, to head-.
quarters to bo questioned. Cervan
tes hab been credited with being one
of the men who inspired Villa's at
tack on Columbus, N. M.
"Although the Americans did not
see his command, tho Villa bandit
was repotted to have about 2." men.
They made no attempt to stand
against the Americans."
The following bore the date of
April !"
"The American expeditionary col
umns continue to Buffer from ab
sence of effectlvo military eo-opera-tlon
on the part of Carranza author
ities, and to-day little hopo remain
ed that further progress could bo
mado without serious clashes with
unruly elements among outlying
Carrnnza commands.
"Becauso of absence of organized
government In somo regions Pene
trated and coldness of somo Carran
za commanders, promises of co-op-oratlon
have not materialized. While
the Americans In many Instances j
have iceelved considerable courtesy j
from Carrnnza officials there has i
been sniping at other points. I
"Tho caution of American officers'
against any net which might oxcltoj
enmity has been a handicap. Anier-
lean troops have, not fired on Villa i
bandits at times becauso they wero I
not suro of their Indentlty. At Par
ral, Major Frnnk Tompkins, who
had only 114 mon, permitted only
his expert marksmen to return tho
Carranza fire In order to avoid the
danger of hitting women nnd child
ten, and tho effectiveness of tho
American resUtnnco thoieby was re
duced." Army Aircraft Destroyed.
