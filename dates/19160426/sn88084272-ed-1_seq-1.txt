German Ships Believed to
Have Been Hit During
the Running Fight.
London. Ens, April 26. Twenty-five
casualties in dead and wounded re
sulted from the bombardment of Lowe
stoft by German warships and the con
sequent running fight with the British
light cruiser squadron and destroyers.
So far as can be learned all the British
Alps returned safely, two of the light
cruisers bearing signs that they had
"been hit by shells, but not in vital
places. A few among the crews of the
British warships were wounded but
not seriously.
One of the British destroyers, which
played a part In a previous battle In
the North sea, was again In the thick
of the fight. A shot penetrated her
engine room and four of her crew
were scalded.
After firing into Lowestoft for 20
minutes, the Germans retreated. The
casualties aboard the British ships oc

WILSON DEFENDS i
G VESSELS
Difference Between Mer
chantmen Armed For
Offence and Defence.
Washington, D. C, April 26. A state
ment defining the attitude or the
United States toward armed merchant
ships was made public today by the
state department by direction of presi
dent Wilson. It originally was pre
pared as a circular note to other powers
but It later was decided to Issue it as a
statement.
The statement holds to the right of
a merchant ship to arm for protection
only, but declares that "merchantmen
which have used their armaments for
aggressive purposes are not entitled to
the same hospitality in neutral ports
as peaceable armed merchantmen."
Determining; Status ot Ship.
"The status of an armed merchant
vessel of a belligerent," says the state
ment, "Is to be considered from the
point of view of a neutral when the
vessel enters Its ports and from that or
an enemy when the vessel is on the
high seas."
The statement treats at length these
differences in status and sums them up
as follows:
"The status of an armed merchant
vessel as a warship in neutral waters
may be determined, in the absence of
documentary proof or conclusive evi
dence of previous aggressive conduct,
by presumption derived from all cir
cumstances of the case.
Status Warship.
"The status of such vessels as a war
ship on the high seas must be deter
mined only upon conclusive evidence of
aggressive purpose. In the absence of
which It Is to be presumed that the ves
sel has a private and peaceable char
acter and it should be so treated by
an enemy warship.
"In brief, a neutral government may
proceed upon the presumption that an
armed merchant Vessel of a belligerent
nationality Is armed for asrcTeaaion.
while "a bcllfcexent should proceed on
the presumpWn that the vessel Is
armed for protection. Both oX these-pre-sumptions
may be overcome by evi
dence the first by secondary or col
lateral evidence, since the fact to he
established is negative in character:
the second, by primary and direct evi
dence, since the fact to be established
is positive in character."
nights nnd Duties of Neutrals.
Then the statement goes on at length
to take up the rights and duties of neu.
trals and belligerents as affected by the
state of armed merchant vessels in neu
tral ports and on the high seas. It lays
down the rule that while merchantmen
armed only for protection against the
enemy are entitled to enter and leave
neutral ports without hindrance In the
course of legitimate trade, they are not
so entitled under certain circumstances
which are detailed as follows:
"Armed merchantmen of belligerent
nationality under a commission or or
ders of their government to use. under
penalty, their armament for aggressive
purposes, are not entitled to the same
hospitality In neutral ports as peace

The case came to the court on 17 cer

of civil appeals, styled Charlie Middle

The opinion, written by chief Justice

no fundamental right Is invaded. It
further holds that employers who be

untarily waive the right to have their
liability determined in the courts.
As to employers who remain without
the act, negligence on their part or of

LONDON, Ung., April 26. Drastic

British government to suppress
the uprising In Dublin by the procla

county and by proclaiming the asso

enable the police to break them up.
This was announced In the house of
commons today by premier Asqultli
who, while making a more reassuring
statement with regard to the situa
tion In the Irish capital, did not add
much to previous knowledge of what
has happened there since Monday noon
when rebels took position of the post
office and certain sections of tho city.
The prime minister was able to say.
however, that Liberty Hall, the head
quarters of the Sinn Fein party, and
St. Stephens Green, which seemed to
have been the center of the uprising,
had been reoccupied by the military
who were being reinforced by the
troops from England and BelfaBt.

said, had turned out to assist the an--thorlties.

Previous Demonstrations.
"The revolt In Ireland is the natural

Ireland," says the Dally Mail. "Augus

and premier Asquith. sat still and
allowed a rebel force to be enroled and
armed. They did not move hand or
foot against it. On March 17. 160C
Irish volunteers paraded, mostly armed
with rifles, and nobody stopped or
challenged them.
No Action Against Sedition.
"Mr. Birrell never asked why the
volunteers existed. He knew it was
not to serve against the enemy but
rather to obstruct the Imperial forces.
On December 10 he declared 'evidence
of their disloyalty is voluminous.' yet
he did nothing. If he had, any policy
other than merely drifting It was turn
Ireland Into the disloyal. The govern

by a hlde-the-truth policy. If tho

MINSOLT KAISER
TO U. S. REGJiG SUBMARINES
Chancelor and Chief of Naval General Staff Go to Em
peror's Field Headquarters; German Opinion is Di
vided; One Group Wants Breach With America,
While Other Views Break in Light of Calamity.
BERLIN, Germany, April 26. Chan
celor von Bethmann-Hollweg and
admiral von Holtzendorf, chief ot
the naval general staff, departed for
field headquarters on the Tuesday
evening, train to consult with emperor
William in regard to the reply to the
American note.
The chancclor's conference with
James W. . Gerard, the American am
bassador Tuesday afternoon lasted for
nearly an hour.
Public opinion in Germany respect
ing the American note remains divid
ed In two main directions. One rep
resented by count Ernest vbn Revent
low, the naval expert of the Tages
Zeltung and his adherents, which Is
small but vociferous and powerful con
tinues to assert it would welcome a
breach with America with a sigh of
relief. The attitude of the other group
Is Indicated by a remark by Theodore
Wolff in this morning's Berliner
Tageblatt that not they but other ene
mies of England would welcome a
breach with a feeling or relief."
What will be the outcome of the
deliberations now progressing cannot
now be indicated, but it can be said
that the attitude of responsible lead
ers Is plainly Indicated that whatever
the decision may be. It will be reached
wdth a full appreciation of what a
rupture might mean.
Recognize Gravity of Crisis.
Comment in the press displays neith
er optimism nor pessimism but simply
a full realization of the gravity of the
crisis which must be met and con
fidence that the leaders of the em.
pire will be guided solely bjr the em
pire's. Interests.
Mr. "Wolff, edltorinchief of the Tage
bblatt, again devotes an article in that
paper to the support of the Idea that
a breach of relations between Ger
many and the United States must be
avoided If possible upon any acceptable
basis. He criticises president Wilson's
accusation that submarines are sinking
netltral ships In a pre-consldered man
ner and In pursuance of methods laid
down for them, but he declares It
would be a mistake to answer sharp
words with sharp words.
Would Like to Protect Neutrals.
He Bays: "Most of us would consid
er it great good fortune If it could be
made possiblo to protect peaceable

"This colossal blunder follows upon
and surpasses all other blunders of the
war. How much longer is the nation
prepared to drift under the domination
of leaders who refuse to lead "
Birrell Again riayed.
The Daily Express says that Augus
tine Blrrell's strange hesitation In In
forming the house of commons of the
Irish revolt makes it natural to imagine
the situation is worse than officially
reported. It Is tho duty of the govern
ment, says the Express, frankly to ad
mit the truth that stern measures1 be
adopted-against the "crass folly of the
rebels."
The Dally Chronicle sas: "What Is
most dreaded now that even the order
speedily restored may be at Ihe cost
of bloodshed which may rankle for
generations. One cannot help fearing
reaction against the prospects of con
stitutional home rule"
The Times says: "The whole miser
able Tiuslness is a sorry comment upon
the complete failure of Mr Birrell to
maintain respect for law and order dur
ing the nine years of his weak, callous
administration. Such are tho fruits of
truckling to sedition and making light
of contempt for law."
Invasion la Opera BoutTe.
Sir Roger Casement's invasion ap
pears to have been the merest opera
bouffe, the Times adds. The paper
suggests that the Germans had grown
tired of him and his boasts and In
sisted that ho redeem his promises.
"The Germans may havo calculated,"
continued the Times, "that tho uprising
In Ireland would influence certain
kinds of American oplnton in their
favor at a time when relations with
the United States are critical.
Societies In America Busy.
"German societies and Irish societlei
In America have been working hand
in glove to prejudice opinion against
Great Britain. They doubtless will
exert themselves now about 'Ireland's
struggle for freedom ' If the cabinet
tries to hush up any part of the truth,
the German and Irish agencies In tho
United States will have a free field
for their malign activities, but if tho
government allows responsible, com
petent American correspondents to In
vestigate matters freelv and unfettered,
we are confident the Germans will And
thoy havo failed completely "

Denies Rejoicing Over LusKania.
"Stories published in the entente
press that, following the sinking of
the Lusltanla and In similar cases, all
Germany danced and rejoiced, are a
tremendous mistake.
"Although we are of the opinion
that steamship passengers must them

tics of submarines with the protection
of peaceable lives and neutral prop
erty would be welcomed by us.
"We do not share the conception
that America's hostility would truly
be divinely good fortune for us."
Yellow Press Disturbs Relation.
Mr. Wolff asserts that the American
"yellow press." and certain German
newspapers and politicians have dis
turbed the relations between the two
countries but that Washington must
realize that sober discussion still is
possible in Germany.
"A breach of German-American re
lations would be greeted by the advo

In England and other hostile states

The 19 Villa wounded, taken in the
engagement, and the 25 horses and arm
captured, were taken to Minaca to
await Gen. Pershing's orders as to their
