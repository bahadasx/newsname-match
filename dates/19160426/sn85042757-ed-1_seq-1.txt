fails to interest his bearers.
A very pleasant teature connected
with the dosing exercises of the High
Sch ol was the "Dress Parade given
by Mrs. Olive K. Barnes and her sew
ing classes at the dormitory Monday
afternoon. The young ladie were all
dressed in garments they had made and
,' Cro8svilIe, Crab Orchard, Grassy Cove ! presented a very neat and attractive
have to expect. The subject was
broached by a prospective delegate to
the Keput'li an National Convention
who laid: 'You know, Colonel, I may
make up my ind that we will have to
nominate yoo. '
"The response was characteristically
instantaneous : 'Let me give you a
piece of advn e. If you have any doubt
on the subject do not nominate me.
Get it perfectly cirar in your head that
if you nominate me it mustn't be be
cause you think it is in my interest,
but because y. u think it is in your in
terest and the interest of t&e Republi
can party, and because you think it to
the interest of the United States to
do so. '
"This ia good doetnne. It is the
only posaible basis on which a candi
date for the Presidency or, indeed,
tor any office -should be selected.
"Mr. Roosevelt thereupon proceeded
to outline his beliefs as to the para
mount issues before the people of the
United States at the present time. He
prefaced this statement; of his creed
with the almost superlluous warning,
'Don't you do it it you expect me to
pussy-foot on any single issue I have
raised. ' The Colonel, whatever else
he may be, is no pussy-foot. The first
item in the Kooseveltiar. creed is
Americanism and no hyphenism.

THE ROOSEVELT NON-PARTISAN
LEAGUE. We have $1,000 to start us
off and have an office established. We
hope to get suo-committees in every
city to work for the nomination of the
Colonel. A number of prominent men
of all parties whom we have talked to
have indicated that they would give us
their support.
"We hope to get out some very in
teresting literature, copies of which
will be forwarded to all who join."
Strange as it may seem some oi the
re I advocates of this course are persons
prepared to say that every citizen of j wno are personally opposed to Colonel

we atand for every good American , vocates, that they feel his nomination
everywhere, whatever his birthplace
or creed, and wherever he now lives,
and that in return we demand that he
be an American am' nothing else, with
no hyphen about him.
" 'Every An erican citizen muit be
for America first and for no other
country even second, and he hasn't any
right to be in the United State? at all
if he has any divided loyalty between
this country ami any other.
" '1 don't care a rup for the man's
creed or birtl plaee or national origin,
so long as he is straight United States.
I am for him it he is Ftraight United

him.'
"The second item sets forth his
views on war :
" '1 am not for war; on the con
trary, I abhor an unjust or a wanton
war, and 1 would use every honorable
expedient to avoid even a just war.
But I feel with all my heart that you
don t in the !ong run, avoid war by
making other people believe that you
are afraid to light tor your own rights.
is very mobable and at the same time
consider that the wisest course for the
best interests of the country aside from
any political preference they may
have.
It is a very evident fact that the
name of the Colonel is becoming more
favorably considered by the leaders and
that, coupled with his known strong
position with the voters, certainly
makes of him a candidate of the first
importance.
