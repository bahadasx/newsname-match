BOOS, chief of police.
During a lonely automobile
ride last night when Bissell was ;
taken to Lawrence for safe keep- !
iBS he made a partial confession.
He admitted following the girl
away from the Colonial bakery i
where she left her mother at i
8:15; he admitted walking down
Kansas avenue and buying candy
for her and with walking west
on Fifth street as far as Topeka
avenue in her company. Far-;
ther than that he refused to go ,
in his confession.
Sheriff Kiene and W. E. At

court house was that they went

"I think." aaJd Kiene before he left,
"that I will make a complaint against
PI Oil some time today. I am satis
fied he is the right man. We have
the goods on him and are getting more
vidence all the time."
"The minute Sheriff Kiene makes a
com plaint a warrant will be issued for

Mon, who assisted in the inquisition
yesterday afternoon. "My belief la
that the officers have the guilty man."
Iist night when the authorities
it it out that Bissell hud been re
leased he was taken out of a window
in the court room at the police station
and hurried through the back yard to
the county jail. There he was placed
in a cell farthest removed from the
doulS.
He Was Afraid or Crowd.
W ell glanced out of a window and
saw the crowd of automobiles ant! peo

"Is it as serious as that?" he asked
of Deputy Sheriff Hixon.
"It's a flarned sight more serious
than that," was the reply.

'Goodbye, mamma darling, it's

last words little Kdna Dinsmore ever
uttered to the poor, distracted mother,
who now lies moaning in a humble
home at 1603 Kast Thrid street,

could God ever allow such a thing to

He said he left the bakery a few

Somewhere on Kansas avenue, he
says, he caught up with her. went
into a store and bought a dime's

said, they walked down the street

He admitted he walked with her
to Topeka avenue, but says he left
her there and returned to the

"I asked him what he supposed
the little girl was doing that far
away from the school she had

didn't think much about it; that
he supposed her mother had sent

"I asked him why he bought
