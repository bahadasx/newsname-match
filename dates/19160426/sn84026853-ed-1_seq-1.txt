VILLA BANDITS
WELL SCATTERED
HAVE BROKEN UP INTO SMALL
GROUPS?GOOD MANY CAPTURED.
' Field Headquarters in Mexico,
April 21 (by Aeroplane to Columbus,
N. M., April 23.)?In a week's riding:
and foot climbing through the
liills and canyons of the Guerrero '
district, a cavalry squadron reported
today the discovery of much evidence
that the Villa forces in the northern
part of Villa's old territory are thoroughly
scattered. They found the
influence of these bandits, nevertheless,
still strong with the people. '
Most of the bandits now are living
in the mountains in groups of two or
three and often singly, taking their
food from friends or by threats from
peaceful Mexicans. The cavalrymen
have captured a good many of these
men but it has been extremely difficult
to find any evidence on which to
hold them as prisoners. Occasionally
the bandits make their presence
known to the cavalrymen by a few
long range shots. Thus far not one
American has been hit in the sniping.
A motorcycle rider carrying dispatches
through a mountainous region had
ito nf the closest calls. Three
mounted men, concealed behind an
adobe house, which he had to pass,
dashed out at him, leaped from their
"horses and opened fire on him with
rifles at 25 yards. They hit the machine
but did not damage it. The
dispatch rider gained the cover of a
gate post opened fire and drove the
^Mexicans off.
One of the indications of the scattering
of Villa bands is the difference
noted now in Mexican towns as compared
with those places when the
troops reached them nearly a month
ago. At that time several of the
mountain towns were observed to
have many young tough looking armed
men loitering about the street^.
Now few such characters are to be
seen anywhere in the towns.
POWERFUL INFLUENCES
BUSY TO AVERT BREAK
Washington, April 24.? Indications
that powerful influences in German
politics are opposed to any action
by the Berlin Government which
might lead to the severance Of diplomatic
relations with the United
States are understood to be contained
in confidential dispatches received
to-dav by the State department from
Ambasador Gerard. Socialists and
lal^r leaders are represented as being
p?u-ticularly adverse to any such
| move. Other dispatches from Mr.
Gerard were said to contain strong
intimations that the Berlin Government
would make some concessions
to the United States in reply to the
note demanding the immediate abandonment
of present methods of submarine
warfare. It still is uncertain,
however, whether the concessions
will be sufficiently broad in
their scope to meet the American
demands.
Officials allowed it to become
known that Mr. Gerard's dispatches
indicated that Germany would go to
great lengths to preserve friendly
relations with the United States. Mr
Gerard is understood to have gained
his views during conversation with
Berlin officials, including Foreign
Minister Von Jagow. His dispatches
are said to emphasize the difficulties
by which the German Government is
confronted in endeavoring to find a
way to meet the demands of the United
States without arousing the element
which insists upon a relentless
submarine warfare against the shipping
of the Entente allies. j
The State department tonight was
awaiting a dispatch from Mr. Ger-!
ard reporting the results of a lengthy'
conference today with Dr. Von Beth-!
mann-Hollweg, Imperial German'
chancellor, reported in press dispatches.
Officials expressed a particular
interest in that part of the
press reports which indicated that
the reply to the American note would
not be made until after the chancellor
Vine another ooDortunity to confer
with the Emperor, who is at the
front. The fact that the conference
lasted more than an hour was regarded
as being a hopeful sign; it
being pointed out that if the German
Government was disposed not
to meet the American demands it was
improbable there would have been a
discussion of such length. A report
from Mr. Gerard is expected tomorrow.
All of Mr. Gerard's dispatches received
since the present situation
arose are held by Administration of
Ificials to be of a highly confidential
nature. Consequently only a general
knowledge of their contents is obtainable.

AN APPRECIATED VISIT.
Our old and valued friend, M.

to see us Saturday. He has just r<
covered from an attack of the gripp
and he tells us that it pestered hii
almost as much as the yankies did i
the war between the states in whic
conflict he took an active part.
He brings us the bad news thj
Mrs. Fleming had the misfortun
several days ago to suffer a fractui
of the collar-bone from a fall, an
that she is suffering from it still. W
hope that she will soon recover. Sh
is now seventy-five years of age.
Mr. Fleming tells us that he do<
not read the newspapers, that "thei
are too many lies in them^" that k
[contents himself with "searching tt
scriptures." He told us of seven
passages which had escaped our n<
tice beforehand.
He is much interested too in tl
warlike situation which confron
the people of this country. He say
i though. that he dislikes to read aboi
it as it gets him excited and he wis!
es he was twenty again. In cas
war is declared we would not be su
prised to see him on the road to tl
front with his trusty rifle,
i Mr. Fleming has his own views c
matters, and these do not alwa;
agree with the views of other peopl
Everyone concedes that he thin!
honestly, according to the lights b
fore him, and when he occasional
does not agree with other peopl
they do not fall out with him, n<
he with them. He made a gallai
soldier of the sixties, and since th<
he has lived at home, paid his debt
and made a good citizen, a good hu

PRESS COMMENT

WILSON'S STAND FOR HUMANITY
LAUDED IN FRANCE AND
PRAISED* GENERALLY
IPar:?,
April 21.?Comment of the
French press on President Wilson's
address to congress may be summed.,
up ii\ these words, which the Petit
Parisien prints, in large type, as a
heading over the text of the speech.
"Never has the head of a state
pronounced such grave words against
a state with which it was not at war."
The president's address has made
a deep impression in France. All
the newspapers give it the place of
honor. It overshadows the British ,
cabinet crisis, and even the arrival
of Russian forces at Marseilles. The
speech is not. merely a formal 3 injunction,
the Petit Parisien says: it
is a closely-knit and stern indictment,
pronounced in the name of all neutrals
"against German barbarity and
duplicity, marking the German government
with a brand which nothing
can efface." '
The Matin characterizes the address
as cpoch-makiiig and continues:
| "When the responsible and almost
sovereign head of 100,000,000 free
I citizens mounts the rostrum in congress
to declare 'we are the spokesmen
tif the rights of humanity,' he
has performed an act of immense
moral importance. It .is in the
name of legality that this statesman,
having behind him the country on
which the whole world depends, de|clares
before the whole world: *W$
will not tolerate injustice.'
"In these few words his whole message
is summed up. It is an hiatori?A1
nrlti/tli ia /Icoo Y\ CP nf
tttl CVCllby VT1UVU AO uvovl Ting v*
admiration as one of the'noblest acts
in the memory of mankind."
"Recall* Greatest Days."
I Stephen Pichon, former foreign
minister, says in the Petit Journal
that the firmness and solemnity with
which Mr. Wilson made known his
resolution to congress recalls the
greatest days of American history.
He continues:
"Whether or not the Germans disavow
the action of their submarines*
they are caught in their own trap,
and all their presumption falls to
the ground before the calm and resolute
attitude of a great country
standing up for the rights of humanity."
Under the heading, "Germans Confronted
With an Honest Man," Jean
Herbette, one of the leading French
authorities on international politics,
says:
| "The German government must be
surprised to find itself face to' face
with the only force of which it is ignorant?conscience.
If Germany
I gives in it would be an unforgettable
humiliation, for it would be the triumph
of that ideal of justice and
liberty against which Germany went
to war. The sinking of a few ships,
more or less, would not affect German
interests greatly, but how could
j Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
mention Belgium and Poland as
'pledges' in his peace programs if
{the submarine, that other disloyally.
acquired weapon, had been knocked
I out of his hand by a champion of the
right? The rulers open a breach in
i the fortress of their iniquities."
'Suggests All Neutrals Join Hands
YY 1(11 luc vuuum mm.....
! The Hague, via London, April 21.
?The newspapers of Holland devote
considerable space to discussions of
and speculations on the situation
created by the American note to Germany.
The Nieuwe Courant says
President Wilson evidently has come
i to the conclusion 'that behind the
torpedoings by German submarines,
there is a system imposed by high
authorities."
i The newspaper thinks that a rupture
of relations between Germany
and the United States would hurt all
belligerents and says that neutrals
would deeply regret it should the
greatest neutral find itself unable to
continue as the head of their inter'
ests. It recalls the great mediatory
cotoiVm rendered bv the United
States, such as in the treatment of
inte-ned prisoners and through the
Red Cross?"splendid work to which
thousands owe their lives and health.'
j It asks how Belgian relief measures
could be continued in the event
of a rupture.
"Whatever one may think of President
Wilson and his endless hesitating
notes," says the Amsterdam
Handelsblad, "few will deny that
while seeking to avoid war he always
strove to do what was right and
; just."
| The Handelsblad thinks that for
' Holland a rupture between the Unitjed
States and Germany would likely
aggravate the situation and bring
forth fresh troubles and complica
tions and possibly still greater difficulties
for Holland securing food
supplies.
"Why should not Holland and the
other neutrals," says the Handelsblad
! "join America's laudable endeavors
'and enhance the results of them?
