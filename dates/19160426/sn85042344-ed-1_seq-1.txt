in Senate.
WASHINGTON. April 25. Demo
cratic leuders in the house to
day finally defeated the efforts of
Minority Leader Mann to prevent the
army bill from going to conference
unamended and the conferees of both
houses will meet tomorrow to work
out a final draft of the first t'eut
preparedness measure.
A special rule adopted after brief
debate paved the way for action in
the house. The rule permitted one
motion, to recommit the hill but most
of the Republicans resenting Speak

the fact that all "bin army" men had

WASHINGTON, April 26. Secre
tary I rinsing, in a conference
today with newspaper correspondents,
deprecated the publication of reports
that official dispatcher from Ambas
sador Gerard indicated Germany
might make concessions to the I'nited
States In reply to the note demanding
tho immediate aoandonnient of pres

The last dispatch from Mr. Gerard,
Secretary Iinsing said, was dated be

It is understood here that one of
the objects of the various conferences

responding to the American note.

Berlin Atmosphere Points
to Peaceful Settlement;
No Demonstrations.
BKIil.IN, April 25 (2 p. ni. ) (Via
London. 9:20 p. m.) The Ameri
can ambassador, .lames W. Gerard, is
to have another conference with
Ooelor von Itetlinianii-llollweg this
evening, prior to the Imperial chan
cellor's departure for greal head
quarters. At tho foreign office the corres
pondents were Informed that tho
chancellor was devoting the holidays
lo conferences on tho submarine Is
sues with tho departments concerned.
These have not yet been concluded.
The main purpose of the imperial
chancellor's flying trip to Iteiiin a
Journey which Involves twenty hours'
travel ill each direction has been, as
Is evident from his protracted confer
ence with Ambassador Gerard on
Monday, the desire to obtain lis clear
an Idea as possible of tho attitude
and policy of tho American govern
ment. IIoh; Not Abondoncd.
So far as Germany is concerned
there is still a possibility of a settle
ment and hope has not been aban
doned here. Hut the Germans, ns is
apparent from many conversations
which the Associated I'ress has had
with prominent men since the be
ginning of this crisis, wish to know
before giving their answer what sort
of answer would satisfy the United
States, whether assurances of a prop
erly conducted submarine campaign
would be adequate nnd whether con
cessions now would bo the prelude to
further demands later.
It can be stated positively that
Doctor von Bethmann-Hollweg nnd
his advisers realize fully tho disad
vantages of a break with the United
States and that they do not desire It
if it can be avoided. Rut they feel if
a break must coma ultimately, it
would lie useless to Indulge In con
cisions and compromises now, and
that they might as well have the mat
ter settled.
Confers Alone.
Ambassndor Gerard conferred on
Monday with the Imperial chancellor
alone, none of the chancellor's ad
visers participating In the Interview.
He was able to give the chancellor
little positive or advance information
on the limits of the American policy
beyond the notes themselves, but the
Washington policy, so far as It was
indicated in the various notes to Ger
many, It is understood, was discussed
lengthily and possible solutions to the
questions which have given rise to
tho crisis were considered In this long
and confidential Interview concern
ing which the ambassador naturally
declined to talk to the correspond
ents. Mr. Gerard Immediately cabled
a long account of tho conversation to
Secretary Lansing and the feeling
hero is that if it were possible to ob
tain an answer from Washington be
fore the German council is concluded
and a decision adopted, it might aid
materially in the solution. There is
little expectation of that, however.
Atmosphere I tetter.
There has been a distinctly better
atmosphere in Heiiln of late. On tho
clay of the publication of the Amer
ican note and for some time after
wards, an air of gloom prevailed re
garding future German-American re
lations and many men spoke of a
rupture as inevitable. The word now
Is that a settlement Is within the
reach of possibility and, although It
would be wrong to use the word op
timism, at least the spirit of pessi
mism has notably abated and every
where one hears the query "what
does America want and can we sat
isfy 1'rcsldont Wilson without aban
doning the submarine campaign or
does he want to prevent us from win
ning tho war?"
During the crisis there has been
an utter absence of unfriendly dem
onstrations against Americans.
