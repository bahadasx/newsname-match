Berlin, via wireless.-A narrow es
cape for Emperor Nicholas of Russia
from bombs dropped by an Austrian
airman is reported in Stockholm ad
vices by the Overseas News Agency.
"The Emperor was reviewing the
troops in company with General Brus
siloff (comander of the Russian forces
on the southwestern front) when sud
denly and Austro-Hungarian flier ap
peared and dropped numerous bombs
which landed among the troops, who
fled in wild disorder," says the news
agency statement. "The Emperor, ac
cording to the reports, was hurt and
had a narrow escape, the incident
causing him entirely to lose his self
possession. In consequence, the re
ports added, General Grussiloff was
bitterly reproached and General Ivan
off was recalled to the southwestern
front headquarters."
AFTER HARMONIOUS WORK
ARE ON VERGE OF CLASH.
Majority Leader Kitchen is Striving
to Reach Working Agreement
Washington.-House Democrats and
Republicans, after having worked to
gether harmoniously for four and a
half months, are on the verge of a
clash over the legislative program for
tre remainder of the session.
The majority, because- of carrying
out the wishes of the house in push
ing through the Philippine and ship
ping bills as quickly as possible, is
threatening to invoke drastic rules
which will insure the measures right
of way. The minority while making
no threats are conducting what ap
pears to be a mild filibuster on the
agricultural appropriation bill and
urging consideration of the fortifica
tions or appropriation measures in
liau of the President's special meas
ures.
Minority Leader Mann says he is
willing to come to an agreement with
the Democrats but that "the White
House can't tell us what we must do"
and he is waiting for the Democrats
to make the next move. In the mean
time the Democrats are having many
conferences in Majority Leader Kitch
in's office in an endeavor to reach a
working agreement while on the floor
such problems as poisoning coyotes,
fighting the hessian fly and preserving
the buffalo are being discussed at
lenth.

were renewed indications about the wa
State Department that a wholly differ
ent aspect of the Mexican problem was leg
causing growing concern. That is the wil
movement supposedly headed by Felix oth
Diaz, nephew of the former Mexican for
dictator, for a new revolution against Thi
the de facto Government. None of wa
the information upon which the un
easiness rests has been disclosed. It
is known, however, that several Mexi- bh
t'e
cans in the United States are being
closely watched and it is possible that an
ed
some of the anti-American feeling in ed
Chihuahua state which has met the I
troops pursuing Villa may be attribut- con
ed to this movement. and
It is admitted that official dis- re
patches had carried as a rumor the, dis
report that Mexican officers had warn- sec
ed General Pershing not to proceed iti
south of Parral. It was learned at the an
State Department that a report to this top
effect was transmitted some days be- Z

State to Provide Course In Farming.
"One of the most important mea
ures passed at the 1916 session of th
legislature was the Toole act to prc
vide for the teaching of agricultur
in the public schools," said J. E
Sweadingen, state superintendent o
education.
"Such a law has been urged ani
discussed for years. Mr. Toole ha
been an insistent advocate of the
policy, in and out of the legislature
The proposal was discussed through
out the gubernatorial campaign a:
1914.
'.The establishment of county or die
trict agricultural schools in othe
states has proved expensive. Thy
Toole plan is the outgrowth of the e=
periment conducted in Darlingtoi
county by state, county and distric
school officers, in co-orpration wid
Clemson college.
"In the fall of 1914, Prof. J. M
Napier took charge of an agricultura
class in each of five consolidate
country schools. The principals cc
operated heartily by aiding him 11
class room instruction and filed ex
perimentation. The result was pro
nounced successful by men like D. R
Coker, Bright Williamson, L. W. Dick
V. E. Rector and D. L. Lewis. In th
fall of 1915, two additional expert
were employed in Darlington count:
and 14 schools organized regula
classes in agriculture.
"The act is based also on the Nichol
son rural graded school law of 1912
which has been so stimulating in pro
moting rural graded school progress
Three, four or five schools must cc
operate in the employment of an agri
cultural teacher. Each school mus
have an enrollment of at least 75
three teachers, a three-room building
an eight mill tax and a school farn
of at least two acres. The tax is re
ruired in order to insure adequate
support; the school farm is necessarl
in order to provide a demonstration
plot.
"The group of co-operating district,
supplies $750 and the state contribute:
an equal amount. A salary of $1,!0(
Is thus made a-iailable for the ernloy
ment of a trained teacher of agricul
ture, who may act as superintendent o:
the group of schools."
The act was approved March 27
1916.
In commenting upon the outlook
the state superintendent said that 1!
:r 15 groups of schools are readily
available. Anderson, Chesterfield, Col
etan, Darlington, Dillon, Florence
Greenville, Horry, Laurens, Oconee
Drangeburg, Spartanburg and Wil
amsburg, all have sections witl
schools that ought to undertake thie
work. In selecting the localities con
sideration must be given to good
'oads in order to prevent too mudt
aste of time in traveling from school

Columbia.
I - Hearing on the petition of David
- B. Henderson of Charleston for an
1 order to prevent the attorney general
and the insurance commissioner from
enforcing the terms of the anti-com
pact fire insurance act was held be
fore the supreme court.
The petitioner was represented at
the hearing by T. Moultrie Mordecai,
r J. N. Nathans and A. T. Smyth of the
Charleston bar. The state officials
were represented by W. H. Townsend
of the Columbia bar and Thomas H.
Peeples, attorney general.
The arguments by the attorneys for
both sides contained many points and
Sauthorities.
The demurrer of the attorney gen
eral charged that the petition did not
state facts suffioient for a cause of
action.
After hearing the arguments the
supreme court took the case under
advisement.
In the argument by the petitioner's
attorneys it was charged that the
Laney-Odom act violates several sec
tions of the state constitution.
In his argument to the court the
attorney general stated that the pe
titioner "has not shown that he has
been injured or is threatened with
any injury by reason of the enforce
ment of the act of 1916 to prevent
fire insurance companies or associa
tions or partnerships doing a fire in.
surance business in this state to enter
into any compact or combination with
any other fire insurance companies,
associations or partnerships, approved
March 2, 1916; and he Is not in a posi
tion to ask this court to consider or
determine the constitutionality of this
act. " The attorney general also
stated that the respondents "would!
welcome a decision from the court
construing the act in question and
directing them as to their duty there
under."
"The provision," said the attorney
general, "for violations of the act is
germane to its subjeet, and the act
is not to be considered as unconsti
tutional because there is no allusion
to these provisions in its title.
- "The fact that penalties are im
posed for violation of the provisions
of the act does not render these sec
tions void as being without title; forI
it would be a natural complement to
the act regulating the business of in
surance to include any just and prop

Soluble salts should not occur in e
cess, although the vine will endure
large proportions of alkali.
The deep rooting of grapevines is
absolutely essential to -long-lived
planits and the production of large
yields of excellent fruit. In Irrigated
sections, where rainfall does not co
cur during the growing season, the
Idepth of root penetration Is deter
mined by the abundhnce and location
of the moisture. Loose, open soils,
wetting easily to a good depth, per
mit deep penetration of the soil-mass
with feeding roots. Vines in such
soils make vigorous top growth, with
corresponding well developed stems
and spurs, and are capable, if prop
erly pruned, of bearing enormous crops
of well developed fruit of desirble
quality. , Compact soils, carrying large
percentages of moisture near the sur
face and none below, cause the plants
to become shallow rooted. The min
eral food supply Is consequently lim
ited and the roots are subjected to -
Iextreme and rapid changes of temper
ature and moisture. Such plants pro-.
duce inferior fruit, the yielding dur
ing season varies greatly, the produc
ing lifetime of the plant Is short, and
the vineyard Is likely to result in
financial loss. The selection of the
right type of sonl is therefore very
essential to success.
Pruning and training are also Impor
tant factors to consider In the culture
of grapes.
