Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
" Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Royal, made of cream of tartar derived from
grapes, or am I willing to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate, both
derived from mineral sources?"
The names of the ingredients printed
on the label show whether the kind you
are now using or any brand, new or old,
that may be offered is a genuine cream
of tartar powder, or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate.
