CONFER
Heads of the German Gov
ernment Discuss Answer
to Be Made U. S. Demand
on the Submarine Warfare
Berlin, April S6. lmprll Chan
tailor von Bethmann-IIollweg and
Admiral von Holtiendortf arrived to
day at Kaiser Wllhelm's field head
quarters for an all-Important con
ference concerning the crista . In
German-American relations.
Von Hollweg la expected back In
Berlin by the week-end. pcrhapa with
rough draft of the German reply
.to American submarine demandi.
The split In newspaper ranka over
the submarine Issue was mora pro
nounced today. The Voaslche Zeltung
led that portion of the press urging
the preservation of friendly relations
with the United States.
On the other hand, Count Revcnt
low In his writings demanded that
to further concessions be made, argu
ing that If war results from this stand
and the United States aelzed Intern
ed German ships, the German victory
will more than restore these losses.
If beaten in the war, Iteventlow
argued that Germany would lose as
many ships as there are now In
American porta anyway.
It Is probable there will be no
reply to the American note until
Washington answers Gerard's request
tor more definite Information regard
ing the conditions President Wilson
wants to Impose.
Berlin, April 26. President Wll
aon'a demand that submarines warn
freight vessels as well as llnera be
fore attacking them Is a moBt seri
ous obstacle In the path of an amic
able settlement of the German
American dispute, the United Press
learned today on good authority.
Other points at Issue may be dis
posed of without danger of a diplo
matic rupture.
But strong opposition la felt to
safeguarding the crews of freighters,
since practically every enemy merch
ant ship la engaged almost solely In
carrying munitions .of war to the
allies and goes armed.
There la a growing feeling, how
ever, that there will be no break. It
is atlll too early to say that tba crisis
has passed. The situation apparent
ly depends upon the firmness of Pre
sident Wilson's stand. Mattera are
awaiting Imperial Chancellor von
Bothmann-HoIlwe,g's second confer
ence with the kaiser. He has repeat
ed to the kaiser his conversation of
Monday with Ambassador Gerard, in
which he sought to learn the exact
oondltlona under which Germany
could conduct ita submarine warfare
to meet with President Wilson's ap
proval, Prominent Germans talked with
von Hollwog after his conference with
Gerard and one of the most distin
guished said later thaUhe best Ger
man forces wore attempting to reach
a satisfactory understanding and that
they would be successful, unless
Washington weighed Germany's posl-
tlon too lightly. "
The American chamber of com
merce held a lengthy meeting yes-
, terday, but reached no conclusion as
. to whothor members should close
their affairs pending the outcome of
the crisis. Several American .busi
ness men aro leaving tho country.
IOPK PLEADS FOR 1
OKDER IV IRELAND
London, April 20.7-A wireless mes
sage from Rome today reported thnt
the pope strongly disapproved of the
Irish disturbances In Dublin and rec
ommended thnt the people remain
quiet.
fiTiin
BEEN DECLARED
London, April 28. Government
troops, hastily transported from Eng
land and rushed from Belfast, reach
ed Dublin and occupied fit Stephen's
and Liberty Hall In the heart of the
city, Premier Asqultb announced to
day. Martial law has been declared
In Dublin county.
Augustine Blrrell, chief secretary
tor Ireland, announced be was leav
ing for Ireland this afternoon to
direct auppresslon of tbe Sinn Fein
revolt. .
London, April 26. Prompt and
energetic steps to put down tbe Sinn
Pels Insurrection In Dublin are be
ing taken by the government. The
censor permitted the United Press to
cable this, although It was impos
sible to send the details.
Dublin Is still cut off by telegraph.
According to tbe best available In
formation the rebels hold the prin
cipal part of tha city. .. It la believed
that serious fighting continues, al
though the revolt has not yet spread
elsewhere In Ireland.
The general post office Is thought
to be still In possession of the Irish.
The Dally Chronicle pointed out that
officials did not claim the govern
ment troops bad recaptured an "Im
portant position there," and remark
ed that this omission suggests tha
rioters are still holding out
Information from tba acene of the
disturbance Is confined to official dis
patches. Newspapers generally took
the view that the rebellion was not a
surprise. For weeks there have been
rumors of an Impending revolution,
some of this reports even fixing the
date of tbe outbreak definitely as
Barter.
"Elver since the Ulster volunteers
sot up their deplorable example of
open lawlessness and armed defiance
of the crown, all Irish extremists
have been tempted to preach violence
as the argument to which English
rule must listen," said the London
Chronicle. "Leas than a month ago
the Ulster volunteers perpetrated a
sensational act of lawlessness at
Broagh. A large detachment, with
rifles and ammunition, marched to
the hall of the Hibernians' building
and utterly demolished It, then dam
aged the houses of local Roman Cath
olics with a fusillade of shots. With
such provocation In the north., the
armed strength of the Sinn Feins In
the aouth muBt have grown easily."
The casualties to government sup
porters In the Dublin fights were re
ported a doten killed and 20
wounded. The government did not
announce casualties Buffered by the
Sinn Fein factlonlstB.

the situation. Oerard'B communica
tion outlined Germany's position as

to avoid a diplomatic break.
