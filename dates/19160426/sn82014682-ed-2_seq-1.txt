JUDGMENT REVERSED IN
HALAMA VS. HALAMA AND
SUIT REMANDED TO COURT
In a deccislon handed down today
the supreme court reverses the Judg
ment of T. B. -Stuart, third judge of
the circuit court, and remands the
cause to him for runner proceeaings
in the case of S. Halama against Kalli
Htlama. The plaintiff was the appel
lant in the'ease.-'.- : - "r ' '
The decision of the supreme court
is in two parts, one of which declares
that "it is reserslble error for a circuit
judge, sitting In equity,' to dismiss
platntlfTs bill during the cross-exam
ination of a witness for the defendant,
thereby preventing further cross-exam
ination of such witness. rThe second
part declares that it is ' prejudicial er.
ror to consider as evidence an entry
In a book shown: by defendant to a
witness for plaintiff on cross-examination,
the authenticity of which is dis
puted,, where such book Is not identi
fied and introduced in evidence." .
Whether or not S. Halama was a
minor when he signed a quitclaim
deed for his interest in certain lands
in Maui is one of the questions
brought up in the circuit court trial,
the family Bible, or what was alleged
to be, being introduced as testimony.

' Withdrawing the plea of; "not
guilty," previously made in each of

ing interposed the plea of guilty. :
; The plea came following an hour's
conference between attorneys for bvth
sides, in which it was finally agreed
that if ' Steven should acknowledge
guilt in the four cases against him
the prosecution would be satisfied
with a fine of $100 for one case and
$1 each for the others.
Attorney W. t. Carden stated thee
grounds for the prosecution this moan
ing following . the conference, being
told by Judge Stuart that final deci
sion on the case would be given to
morrow morning, but that he would
"probably decide aa .requested.". ;
. . At the " request of the court the
agreement ..was put in writing and
signed by the attorneys on both aides,
as well aa by Steven. The agreement
says in part: " ; '
"Defendant is to withdraw his pica
of not guilty heretofore interposed in
each of the cases' above described and
plead guilty in each case thereof. .

now on trial, a fine of $100 is to be
Imposed; in each of the other cases, to
wit case 6294, case 6296 and cue
6297, a fine of $1 Is to be imposed
upon the defendant v : : 7 :

stood that no other charges of any

fendant O. A. Steven, for and on ac
count of any matters and things don a
