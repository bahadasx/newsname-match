Ultimatum Sent to Germany
Washington, April 19.?Presi
dent Wilson's long expected fi
nal warning to Germany that lb<
United States will break off dip
lomatic relations unless sh<
abandons her present method o
submarine warfare and immedi
ately declares her intention t<
do so, was delivered today in i
note to Berlin and was announc
ed bv the president in an addres
to a joint session of congress
The president demands nothini
less than the abandonment o
submarine warfare against com
merce.
r> _
ooin ine presiaeni s aaares
and the American note declar
in unequivocal terms that onl1
by Germany acceding: to the de
mand can the breaking off of re
lations be prevented.
The president considers tha
the next step depends solely up
on Germany and that three o
four days constitute a reasonabl
time for a reply. He is willinj
to discuss how submarine war
fare may be conducted withii
the limits of international lav
and humanity after German;
abandons her present methods.
Diplomatic history record
only one instance as yet where i
breaking of relations betweei
two first class powers has no
eventually brought war?tha
which now exists between Get
many and Italy.
Congress received the presi
dent's declaration of his coure
with mixed evidences of con
cern and approbation. Most o
the leaders, Democrat and Re
publican, thought the presiden
hardly could do less and somi
expressed the opinion that hi
action would not lead to war.
Republican Leader Mam
alone of all the opposition lead
ers openly attacked the presi
dent for his stand. He charactei
ized it as a political play.
President Wilson's word
leave no opportunity for mis
understanding. In his addres
to congress he said:
"I have deemed it my duty t<
say to the imperial German gov
eminent that if it is still its pui
pose to prosecute relentless am
indiscriminate warfare the gov
ernment of the United States i
at last forced to the conclusioi
that there is but one course i
can pursue; and that unless tin
imperial German governmen
should now, immediately, de
clare and effect an abandonmen
of its present methods of war
fare against passenger and freigh
carrying vessels this govern
ment can have no choice but tc
sever diplomatic relations alto
gether."
South America Would Aid U. S
Rio Janeiro. April 21,?Th<
publication of the Americar
note for Germany created a deer
impression upon public opinior
and the press.
The Gazeta de Noticias says
"North America by he diplo
matic attitude makes herself the
leader of the neutral Nation!
against piracy."
The Epoca holds that Ger
many's war methods place hei
in political circles outside the
human pale and expresses nc
doubt that in case of war the
United States will rally all the
South American countries.

[ suited in serious embarrassment
to those American industries
t which are in need of dyestuffs,"
( and the imperial German govr
ernment now is prepared to
e make "single exception" in per

An Englishman, an Irisman,
and a Scotchman were one day
t arguing as to which of the three
t countries possessed the fastest
. trains. "Well, said the Englishman,
I've been in one of our
> trains, and we went so fast that
the telegraph poles looked like a
, hedge." I've seen the milestones
{ appear like tomb stones," said
the Scot. "Well," said Pat, "I
t was one day in a train in our
' country, and we passed a field
of turnips, p field of carrots, aud .
a field of cabbages and parsley,
then a pond of water; and we
j were going that quick I thought!

More About Flies
g Southern Ruralist
, One of the greatest menaces
s of the country is the pest of flies.
If the average realized the possi5
bilities of disease and disaster
_ that lurked in the fly a great
.. crusade would be made against
j them.

male lays her egg in manure or
3 some other filthy material. In a
I little while the egg hatches and
3 before long the adult fly emerges,
t Ii feeds a while on the material
in which it breeds and then flies
t away to ihe kitchen or table to
partake of the tood prepared for
( the family. Not content with
this, the pest makes frequent ex
j cursions to the places where
filth accumulates and so scatters
fresh material in places where it
should not be.
Flies are great carriers ot typhoid
fever and other diseases
i that attack man. Many ot the
1 intestinal troubles of the babies
) during the summer are thought
1 to be occasioned by the contaminations
of food, milk and bottles
: by flies.
To protect from these pests all
1 breeding places should be care5
fully watched and, where possible,
protected. All outhouses
should not be exposed, but the
r sanitary outhouse should be used
on every farm. Those interest>

Smoking Stunts the Growth of
Boys
Whatever difference of opinion
there may be about the advisability
of smoking for men,
there is none as to its pernicious
effect upon boys. It affects the
action of the heart and reduces
the capacity of the lungs.
Young men who are being trained
for athletics are not permitted
to smoke by their trainers
because, as they say, "It is bad
tor the wind." The argument
that will appeal most forcibly to
your boy is that smoking will
stunt his growth. It his been
proved that youthful smokers
are shorter and weigh less than
their comrades who do not
smoke. Cigarettes fliv- nnrtien.

active principle of tobacco, is
said bv chemists to be, next to
prussic acid, the most rapidly fatal
poison known. The tender
tissues of a growing boy cannot
absorb even a very small quantity
of it without most injurious
results.?Ladies Home Journal.

Russians In France To Fight
For Allies
The arrival in France of a
large number of Russian troops
to reinforce the Western battle
line has brought great joy to the
entente allied countries, where
it is hoped that with them fighting
shoulder to shoulder at different
points with the British,
French and Belgians, a material
change in the situation may
shortly develop.
How many Russians have
been sent across the seas by
Emperor Nicholas is not known,
but \ hat is characterized as a

Advertise These Things In Your
Local Paper
Farmers, heretofore, have net
advertised much, hut they couM
do so to an advantage. Men in
business far less competitive
than farming find it profitable to
advertise. Of course there are
many staple farm products
which could not be advertised
profitably. But there are others
which would pav well as a result
of systematic advertising.
Many products go to waste
which could be sold if the consumer
knew that they were
available. Livestock, poultry
and poultry products, butter,
milk, wood, fruits, vegetables,
home cured meats, cannee
goods, seed corn, velvet beans,
cowpeas, peanuts, and a hun
dred other things lend themselves
to advertising. The local
paper goes to every corner
of the county and to various
sections ot adjoining counties.
This is the range of territory in
which profitable marketing can
be done from the farm. The
farmer who advertises such produce
as that previously mentioned
will have no trouble in finding
buyers in his locality. The
home paper is the best medium
for advising consumers that this
produce is for sale.

'You are charged," said the
magistrate sternly but kindly,
''With assaulting vour husband."
Gulping down he sobs, the
prisoner wiped away her tears
with a brawny hand and replied
sadly:
"Yes, your worship. I onlyasked
the brute if he would ever
cease to love me, and he was so
long in answering that 1 hit him
in the eye with a broom. I'm
only a defenseless we .an," she
went on in a broken voice, "and
a woman's life without tove is a
mere blight!"
