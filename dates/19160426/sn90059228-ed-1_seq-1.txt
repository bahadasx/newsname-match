A VISIT TO BIRTHPLACE
OF SHAKESPEARE
Hfc Our Trip to Stratford-on-Avon,
September 1914 Described
Briefly.
In view of the fact that the whole
world, and especially the English
speaking part of it, has observed
this month the 300th anniversary of
the death of William Shakespeaie,
it may not be out of place this week
to tell about my visit in 1914 to
Stratford-on-Avon, where stood the
cradle and where also is the grave
of the great poet and dramatist.
I arrived in Liverpool on Satur
day evening, Sept. 13. after a stormy
voyage of nearly five days on a slow
going Danish freighter from Aarhus,
Denmark. Owing to the fear of
mines, the vessel made a long de
tour around the northern coast of
Scotland. Along the Scottish coast
and especially when crossing the
Irish sea, the billows rolled fearfully,
causing the ship to pitch and heave
unmercifully, in the opinion of most
of the passengers who felt a similar
commotion within. Owing to our
late arrival in port we were not al
lowed to land until next morning.
Before the custom's officers had gone
I thru our baggage it was nearly
I noon. Arriving at the hotel that had
been assigned me, I found that about
a dozen people, all stranger's, were
to occupy one room. I did not like
that idea and therefore started out
to find another hotel. I soon found
out that owing to war conditions,
liotel accommodations were almost
impossible to secure in the city.
After calling at nearly a dozen dif
ferent hostleries, I finally found com
fortable lodging at the Aylesworth
'Temperance Hotel, where I remained
to rest up and clean up, after the
ocean trip, until Tuesday morning
"when I left for London. As the ship,
the Mauritania, which was to carry
me back to the United States, was
to sail before Saturday afternoon, I
decided to see as much of England
as I could, in the mean time. Mak
ng use of the stopover nrrvileges of
ray railway ticket my first stop was
at the old tower of Chester, on the
river Dee. After I had alighted
fiom the train and was on the way
up town carrying my own luggage,
a twelve or fourteen year old boy
approached me and asked if he
could not be allowed to assist me. I
scrutinized him carefully from head
to foot and was amazed to see moi*e
holes than cloth in his raiment
Theie was a perfect net work of
holes in his clothing, not owning to
any decree of fashion, as with ladies'
hose, but owing to poverty, evident
ly. Never before have I seen such a
rag-a-muffin. I thought he needed
to earn a few shillings and therefore
bargained with him to show me as
much of the town as he could
until the next train for London
would arrive, which would be in
about three hours. Leaving my
baggage at a hotel, we first proceed
ed to the old stone wall that encircles
the town. This wall nearly two
miles in length was built during the
Roman occupation of England, for
defense purposes and is still in a
fair state of preservation. It is in
places forty feet in height and wide
enough on top to form a pleasant
promenade. I walked around and
at one of several towers I noticed
this inscription: "Upon this tower,
Sept. 27, 1645, stood King Charles I
and saw his army defeated at Row
ton Moor." Many old ruins and
relics from the distant past were
pointed out to me as we sped along,
among them some stones that had
been used in a Roman bath, the
crumbling pillars and walls of an old
church built in 689, by KingEthelred,
a bridge that had been built by
Edward I, two hundred years before
Christopher Columbus discovered
America, a piece of a road built by
the Romans and still in use, etc,
etc Leaving the walls the imposing
cathedral built in the middle of the
sixteenth century was next visited.
Here I saw some tattered flags that
had been through the storming of
__ Quebec at the time when General
f"*^*4fiW)]fe was slain. Many of the
/A-*'
.names on graves and monuments,
W there and elsewhere in England show
"'unmistakable traces of Scandinavian
"origin. I tarried too long on this
interesting place and consequently
lost my dinner. Bidding farewell to
my guide I had to hurry to the train
which was tq carry me to Stratford
on-Avon, mylc^ext stopping place.
Birmingham, a great manufacturing
center with its hundreds of flaming
fiery furnaces suggestive of hades,
was passed about dusk, and in
another hour I was in Stratford-on
Avon, the birthplace of the immortal
Shakespeare.
At the Fountain
Hotel, a short distance from the
put up for the night. Hav
depot, I
ing had no dinner, I felt the need of knew all the secret
a substantial supper and this was
kindly provided, altho I had arrived
after the meal hour. Tired after the
day's sight-seeing, I retired to my
loom and sought repose. When I
awoke next morning and looked out
thru the window my eyes beheld a
beautiful fountain in the center of
a small square, where several
streets converged After break
fast I strolled toward the foun
tain, where a stream of water
was flowing into a granite basin,
and noticed with considerable
interest that it was the American
memorial fountain presented by
Geoige W. Childs, of Philadelphia lo
the town of Stratford in 1887. I
was pleased to be reminded of
America, where I had my home and
loved ones, as I" stood on these hal
lowed grounds once trod by noble
Shakespeare's feet. I felt that evei
I, though an American, could claim
a part of the great poet. His gen
ius, though belonging to England in
the first place, is in reality the conf
mon heritage of all mankind.
Shakespeare belongs to all races and
to all times because he has better
than any one else expressed the
thoughts and feelings that find lodg
ment in the human heart.
But across the street yonder I
see the building, the outlines of
which were familiar, from pictures
I had seen and which told me that
there is the house where Shakespeare
was born. I hastened thither,
bought my admission ticket and soon
found myself inside the house The
house is constructed of re-enforced
plaster, that is, a framework of
heavy timbers filled in with coai-se
plaster. The house is kept in repair
and preserved as far as possible like
it was in Shakespeare's time. On
the ground floor is located the kit
chen, where is shown an old clock
and some pieces of old furniture.
The large inner double room has
been turned into a museum where
numerous relics from Shakespeare's
time are exhibited, such as old corns
and medals, deeds to property
bought by Shakespeare, deeds wit
nessed by Shakespeaie's kindred,
documents in two law suits in which
Shakespeare attempts to collect
money due him, signatures ^of
Shakespeare's elder daughter aW
grand daughter, photographs and
busts produced after the poets death,
old editions of Shakespeares plays,
etc. A well preserved copy of the
first folio published in 1623, seven
years after his death is found there.
No edition of his works was pub
lished during his life-time. This
would seem to show the extreme
modesty of the poet, who evidently
did not realize the excellence of the
productions of his genius. Ascend
ing the stairway I came first into a
large double room which is used as
a library and where most of the
books and commentaries that
have been written about Shakespeare
and his plays, have been collected
from all corners of the earth, also
the works of contemporary authors,
and books with which Shakespeare's
work shows him to have been fam
illiar. There are several works on
herbs "and theyr gracyous vertues
which god hath ordeyned for our
prosperous welfare and helth for
they hele and cure all maner of
dyseases and sekenesses that fall or
mysfortune to all maner of creatures
of god created practysed by many
expert and wyse myatsers, etc" A
book on medical notes by John Hall,
Physician, who married Susanna, the
poets elder daughter* is seen here,
also many photographs and old
views of Stratford and London, and
various articles of historic or anti
quarian value.
From this room we stepped into
the holy of holiest, the very room in
which Shakespeare was born. Not
in a gilded palace, surrounded by
pomp and luxury, did Shakespeare
on April 23, 1564 see the light of
day, but in a very modest apartment.
He was of humble parentage. At
the time of his birth the father, John
Shakespeare, was probably running
a butcher shop in one of the rooms
down stairs.- But from this lowly
birth room, as from the manger at
Bethlehem, though in far lesser
measure, has issued forth a light
that has been an inspiration, and de
light to millions of human beings.
When we stood in this room, whose
walls have re-echoed to the infantile
cries and joyous prattle of the child
Shakespeare, we felt almost as if
we were in a church, a holy place.
Leaving the building and its court
eous attendants, we next took a stroll
thru the garden in the rear of the
house, where are now grown all the
plants ^and flowers mentioned by
Shakespeare in his plays, their num
ber being over one hundred^
1 All
were carefully labelled where** they
grew. Shakespeare was indeed a
versatile man. From his works it is
evident that he was a lover of na
ture in all its varied forms, as well
as _familliar with political, religious
and social affairs of his day, and
founts from
which spring human will and action.
Next we visited the Guild Chapel,
the Guild Hall and Grammar School,
and the Guild Almshouses, a row of
old buildings, where municipal and
educational work was carried on in
Shakespeare's time. It was in the
grammar school that Shakespeare
received his very limited scholastic
education. The room is still used
for school purposes evidently, as
when we looked in we saw a class of
boys reciting.
Next I proceeded to the Shakes
peare Memorial Theater, on the
banks of the Avon, erected in 1877
by funds contributed largely from
Shakespearean scholars and admirers
in all parts of the world. Here is
found a fine bronze statue of Shakes
peare upon which the sculptor had
spent twelve years of work, a large
library of Shakespearean and
dramatic literature, and a large
picture-gallery, in which portraits of
famotwptctors and many scenes from,
the plays are exhibited. In the
theater, annual Shakespeare festival
performances are given. From the
high tower, I obtained a fine view
of the town and environs. Leaving
the building I stepped to the river's
edge to wet the soles of my shoes
in the small "Stream that flowes there
as placidly as when the boy Shakes
peare bathed in its waters. Of all
things in the town the Avon has
probably changed less since that
time. It is a modest, meandering
stream, not much more pretentious
than our own Snake.
Next I hastened to the Collegiate
Church of the Holy Trinity, where
Shakespeare and his wife sleep their
last long sleep. Here I saw in a
glass case, the Parish Register in
which Shakespeare's baptism and
burial are recorded But the
greatest point of interest is
the Choir, where the Shakespeare
graves lie side by side, just inside
the 'altar rail. Upon the stone cov
ering the poet's remains are these
well-known lines:
"Good* friend, for Jesu's sake
forbeare,
To digg the dust enclosed heai'e.
Blest be ye man yt (that) spares
thes stones,
And Curst be he yt (that) moves
my bones^'-^ f^
I is not likely that^S
himself wrote this epitaph. It seems
so common place and lacking in the
lofty ideas one always finds in his
productions.
There are beautiful stained glass
windows in the church, one being
known as the American window,
presented by American visitors and
containing artistic pictures of "The
seven ages of man." A Chain Bible
with portions of the chain remaining,
is an interesting relic from a time
when Bibles were not as plentiful as
now. It was printed in 1611. A
Shakespeare bust, probably taken
from a death mask, is seen above his
grave. The oldest portion of the
church dates from the year 1210.
I had now followed Shakespeare
frbm his cradle to his grave, but
had skipped one point of interest,
that I was made aware of as soon
as I had made my exit. A young
man selling postal cards accosted me
and told me that I ought by all
means see Anne Hathaway's cottage
on the outskirts of the town and he
willingly offered to guide me to the
place for a small consideration I
agreed and following this guide over
garden paths, stone walls and fields,
the cottage was soon reached. In
this old house, yet well preserved
and kept in thorough repair, lived
Anne Hathaway, the girl whom
Shakespeare married when he was
19 years old, she being seven years
older. In front of the fireplace
stands the old bench on which
William and Anne no doubt had sat
many a time and whispered words
of love to each other. It is said that
the match was not a congenial one
to either party, owing to differences
in age, temperament and aspirations
in life, but it is well to note that
neither of them rushed to the divorce
court as people are prone to do now,
but each evidently tried to make the
best of the bargain. After all, it
was probably a good thing that
Shakespeare with his poetic fancy
was held down to earth somewhat
by his better half. And yet Shakes
peare was no fledgeling in worldly
affairs. It was probably due more to
his keen business ability than to his
dramatic talents that he became con
nected with the theaters in London,
in one or two of which he was
heavily interested financially. He
evidently made good money at the
business, and from his plays,
judiciously investing his savings in
houses and farms in and around
Stratford. After a successful career
in. London he returned to Stratford
$, ltv the retired life of a gentle
man* He bought the best house in
town ^witha large plot of ground,
which. hefOproceeded to improve.
This is called "The New Place."
Uj^ j^ returning from the Hathaway
cottajge I viewed these fine grounds. relfei)
The house was destroyed long ago,
but the well and part of the foun
dation are still there, also a mulberry
tree that has grown up from the
root of a tree planted by Shakes
peare. That Shakespeare was a
shrewd business man seems well
established. He loaned money to
his townsmen and must have had a
considerable income from rentals of
property he owned. Many learned
scholars have doubted the authorship
of the plays attributed to him, hold
ing that Bacon,. Marlow, Ben Jon
son, or other writers of that time,
are responsible for them. But we do
not want to rob Shakespeare of this
honor. The first edition of the plays
was published in 1623, seven years
after the poets death, and it would
seem that at that time, when many
were still living who had known
Shakespeare, that a strenuous pro
test would have been made by liter
ary men in case the authorship was
not genuine. It is unthinkable
that the people of that time would
permit a fraud to be passed down
tc posterity, if they knew it. That
Shakespeare was a man of promin
ence in the community is evident
from the fact that the most conspic
ious place in the great church is oc
cupied by his grave. Wealth of
course, may have helped to bring this
about, but it seems that some other
achievement would also have been
required. I am, for my part, well
satisfied to let Shakespeare have the
honor of authorship of the plays that
bear his name. If he did not write
them, then bring better proof that
somebody else did so.
Leaving "The New Place," I
parsed the ivy covered house of
Marie Corelli, the well known novel
ist, author of "Thelma" and other
good stories. Next I bought ad
mission to the "Harvard House," -the
home of John Harvard's mother, now
the property of Harvard College,
Cambridge, Mass. Thus again I was
reminded of America. John Harvard
emigrated to New England and
dyeing in 1638 donated his library of
300 volumes and a sum of money to
the great institution that bears his
name. This old house, now fully re
stored, is a link that unites England
a'nd America
only a few minutes remained until
the train for Oxford was due. Again
I had to go without my dinner but
I did not mind that, as the many
interesting things I had seen easily
made up for a hundred dinners I
had been to the shrine of Shakes
peare and that was enough.

Good Year to Plant Potatoes.
InL considering the agricultural ap
propriation bill in congress the other
day an interesting discussion took
place in regard to a clause appro
priating $20,610 for chemical investi
gations of soil types and soil pro
ductivity in connection with the soil
survey. From this discussion we
glean that potash is a very necessary
fertilizer for growing -ootatoes in

to other crops. In view of the cuttat
ing off of our potash supply from
Germany, on account of the war, it
seems very probable that the potato
crop in the east and south will be
very small this year. England as
well as other countries of Europe
find themselves in the same predica
ment as regards potash, and will
need to import large quantities of
tubers It will be wise, therefore,
for the farmers in the western
states, where a potato crop can be
produced without fertilizers, to put
a largely increased acreage into po
tatoes this year. The chances are
that prices will be high next fall.

SEEDING IS NOW
IN FULL SWING.
Weather now seems settled and
spring work has commenced in real
earnest In this latitude wheat may
be seeded with safety as late as May
15 and even later. The soil is getting
in fine condition in all but the low
places, farmers tell us, and the work
will be rushed until the usual acre
age is seeded. More corn than usual
will be planted this year A late
spring with us generally means a
good corn year. The potato acre
age will also be increased. There is
likely to be a shortage in the po
tato crop -x4 fall and prices will
infrtf&n pw^bality^oV- good.-* More*
oats and barley will be seeded this
year than usual as farmers are gett
ing more and more into stock and
find that it pays well to have an
abundance of feed.
NEW MOVE FOR A HOTEL.
The Commercial Club held i meet
ing last evening to consider ihe
question of a new hotel, an improve
ment greatly needed in our cty*
Two propositions were presented,
either of which might be feasible.
Mr. Morkassel presented a plan of
Mr. Hitchcock, of Crook^ton, in
which the latter offered vo sell a
section of land and other pioperty
to our citizens, he agreeing to use
the proceeds in erecting an up-to
date hotel here The ochij proposi
tion was from Mr. Snyde- of Ada,
who offered to invest 4,C0 in a
hotel building here, and $3,000 in
furnishing same. The hui'din.? alone
was to cost $20,000 of wnVn $16,000
was to be furnished by our citizens,
best to the members of the club and
a meeting with him for further dis
cussion will be held in few days.
Mr. Snyder is an experienced hotel
man, having been engaged in tha
business at Ada for many years.
The banks of the city can easily ad
vance the money require 1 and would
have ample security thereior in the
building. A site will hav2 to be
furnished free by the city. The
question of location was not consid
ered, but its selection will depend
largely upon availability and cost of
procuring same. It is to be hoped
that something more tangible than
talk will result from this new move
to secure a much needed improve
ment for our city.
THE BOXVILLE FARMERS' CLUB.
The Boxville Farmers' Club held a
meeting on Friday evening, April
21st, and a large crowd was in at

with a talk upon the Baboock test,
giving its origin, its purpose, and its
