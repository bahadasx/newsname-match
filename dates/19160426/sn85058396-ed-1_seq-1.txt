RETURN SAFELY
Twenty-five Dead and Wound
ed in Running Fight With
German Squadron That
Attacked Lowestoft.
The following official account of tho
raid was given out today
"The bombardment of Lowestoft
and Yarmouth yesterday morning be
gan at 4:10 o'clock and lasted about
half an hour. Despite the heavy guns
employed by the enemy ships, the
damage was relatively slight. A con
valescent home, a swimming bath, the
pier and forty dwelling houses were
extensively damaged. Some 200 dwel
ling houses were slightly damaged.
"Two men, one woman and ono child
were killed. Three persons were ser
iousiy wounded and nine slightly
wounded. '
"Fire was opened on Great Yar
mouth at the same time. Here tho
damage "was ene--largcbullding ser
iously damaged by fire and another
building slightly damaged by shell
fire."
London, April 26, 3 32 a. m. Twenty-five
casualties' In dead and wounded
resulted from the bombardment of
Lowestoft by German warships and
the consequent running fight with the
British light cruiser squadron and de
stroyers, so far as can be learned. All
the British ships have returned safe
lv two of the light cruisers bearing
signs that they had been hit by shells,
but not in the same locality.
One of the British destroyers, which
played a part in a previous battle in
the North Sea, was again In the thick
of the fight. A shot penetrated her
engine room and four of her crew
were scalded.
After firing into Lowestoft for 20
minutes, tho Germans retreated. The
casualties aboard the British ships
occurred in the running fight which
ensued It is generally believed that

when the light British cruiser squad

"The raid was not undertaken with
wanton risk, but with a definite pur

"The reply is especially notable in
that the doctrine of ultimate destina

The Daily News remarks:
"The value of tho reply lies in the

BLIND POLICY
BRINGS REVOLT
Irish Rebellion Another Colos
sal Blunder Which Surpasses
All Others of Present War.
London, ApriL 26. "The revolt in
Ireland-is the natural Tesult of" the
government's policy in Ireland," says
the Daily Mail. "Augustine Birrell,
chief secretary for Ireland, and Pre
jnier Asquith, sat still and allowed a
rebel force to be enrolled and armed.
They did not move hand or foot
against it. On March 17, sixteen hun
dred Irish volunteers paraded, most
lj armed with rifles, and nobody stop
pepd or challenged them.
"Mr. Birrell never asked why the
volunteers existed. He knew it was
not to serve against the enemy, but
rather to obstruct the imperial forces.
On December 10 he declared "evidence
of their disloyalty is voluminous,' yet
he did nothing.
Blind to Treason.
"If he had any policy other than
merely drifting, It was to turn a blind
eye to the disloyal movement. The
government persunded itself that the
treason could be overcome by reso
lutely looking the other way. The
jjovernment's wait-and-see policy was
complicated by a hide-the-truth policy.
"If the newspapers had been per
mitted to publish Information in their
hands Sunday night these things could
not have happened. The Irish authori
ties would have been aroused from
their sleeping sickness by the publica
tion of news that something very ex
ceptional was occurring. They might
have taken ordinary precautions, but
the press was muzzled. It is proof of
the grossest negligence and obtuse
ness when four or five parts of a
great city can be seized by compara
tively a small number of armed men.
"This colossal blundor follows upon
and surpasses all other blunders of
the war. How much longer Is the na
tion prepared to drift under the dom
ination of leaders who refuse to lead."
Tho Times says, the uprising in Ire
land would Influence certain kinds
of American opinion in their favor at
a time when relations with the United
States aro critical. German societies
and Irish societies In America have
been working hand in glove to pre
judice opinion against Great Britain.
They doubtless will exert themselves
now about 'Ireland's Btruggle for free
dom.' If the cabinet tries to hush
up any part of the truth or confine
tho Intelligence reaching America to
official communications doled out by
themselves, the Gorman and Irish ag
encies in the United States will have a
free field for their malign activities;
but, if the government allows respon
sible, competent American correspond
ents to Investigate matters freely and
unfettered, we are confident tho Ger
mans will find they have mlsundor
stood real American opinion."

Richard Bartholdt.
Richard Bartholdt, former eon
pressman from Missouri, and leader
of the German-Amoricans in the
United States, declares that if war
breaks out between the United States
and Germany, the people of German
descent in this country will be tho
most loyal citizens of the republic
rived in London without incident and
immediately was lodged in the Me
tropolitan prison.
The fact that Sir Roger Casement
has been brought to England to stand
trial and is detained in military cus
tody leads to the assumption that ho
will be tried on the charge of high
treason.
Facing High Treason Charge.
This charge has been preferred less
than half a dozen times in England In
the last hundred years. The last in
stance was during the Boer war, re
sulting In the conviction of Arthur
Lynch in 1903. Lynch, who is now a
member of the house of commons, was
sentenced to death but the sentence
was commuted and a year later a
pardon was granted.
Tho Express suggests the possibility
that Sir Roger, if convicted of high
treason, may be beheaded, as under
the existing law a person found guilty
of this offense, may, by crown war
rant, be given the penalty of behead
ing instead of hanging.

ments of American troops have resumed active pursuit of I jH

ral where the bandit chieftan is reported to be hiding. I l

Field Headquarters, April 26, via Wireless to Columbus, i ;H
N. M. Two American soldiers were killed and three wounded 'H
in an engagement at Tomachie, in the center of the Sierra 'H
Madres, in western Chihuahua, on April 22, according to an 1 1 H
official reporting here today. The Villa command under four H
chiefs, Baca, Cerventeves, Docuents and Rio, were routed. H
After the battle the Americans found six dead Mexicans and H
six wounded. ;H
Reports received here made no
mention of Villa himself being with
the band, although it had been report
ed previously that he was in hiding
In the mountains in that vicinity.
While last "reports placed the bandit
chieftain at Monava, about 50 miles
south of Tomachic, which is approxi
mately 65 milCB southwest of Cihua
hua City, belief was firm here, that
Villa was not in the command en
gaged. Vllllstas Unable to Stand.
Once during the flight the Villistas
received reinforcements and attempt
ed vainly to make a stand against the
Americans. When night came the
pursuit became Increasingly difficult
because of the nature of the terrain,
honeycombed as it is with mountain
caves and trails in which there are
many jagged rocks, ruinous to the
feet of the horses. Colonel Dodd pur
sued the Villistas toward MInaca, his
base, where he is now reported to be
awaiting supplies.
The nineteen Villa wounded, taken
in the engagement, and the twenty
five horses and arms captured, were
taken to MInaca to await General
Pershing's orders as to their disposi
tion. Colonel Dodd was given much cred
it here for his feat and was officially
commended for the promptness shown
by his small outnumbered force.
Other reports reaching here told of
bitter feeling expressed toward Amer
icans by natives. It Is assumed that
tho reinforcement of Mexicans was
made up of peons.

Washington, April 26. Advices as
to the time of General Obregon s ar
rival on the border to confer with
General Scott and General Funston
were still awaited today at the state
and war departments. Judging by tho
time Obregon was reported officially
to have passed Satillo yesterday, offi
cials estimated he might reach Eagle
Pass tonight. Nothing has been re
ceived so far to indicate where the
conferonce may be held.
Secretary Baker suggested that the
question of greater co-operation be
tween American and Carranza forces
would bo the main topic of discussion.
State department officials said no
steps toward preparing a reply to
General Carranza's noto would be tak
en until a report from General Scott
was received.
Col. Dodd in Engagement.
El Paso, Tex., April 26. A report
has been received here that Colonel
Dodd's advanced cavalry detachment
had an engagement several dayB ago
in which both sldeB suffered losses. It
was not indicnted whether tho battle
was with Villista bands or with Car
ranza troops.
The Information regarding the bat- H
tie came In a private dispatch but '
gave no information where the en- JH
gagement took place. Advanced dc- : H
tachments of Colonel Dodd's cavalry H
recently have been operating In a i 1
