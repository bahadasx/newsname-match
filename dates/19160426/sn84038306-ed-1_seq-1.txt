FUNCTION ATT
I
The form&l opening of the new
armory Tuesday evening was one of
the most largely attended and joyous
soc.al functions ever witnessed in
this cjty. Three hundred guests par
took of the banquet at the K. P. hall,
which was served by the K. P. lodge.
It was a sumptuous spread, in keep
ing with the brilliant company and
the occasion. The K. P. boys de
serve a special mention for the man
ner in which the banqueters were
served. Their work was equal to
that of professionals.
Captain W. F. Grossman was the
first speaker. While our space will
not permit more than a list of the
names off those who responded to
toasts, we oan, not refrain from Bay
ing that the Captain's remarks were
timely and exceedingly practical. He
said that -4* tteu of a formal recep
tion fpr the visiting officers at the
Guard he would introduce them in a
way that would save time. Each
officer rose when his name was call
ed and the Captain introduced him to
4U present The banqueters liber*
aHy cheered each of them as they
acknowledged the introduction.
Among the visiting Guard otfficers
were General Herbert A. Alien of

MANCHESTER CHURCHE8
CHANCES FAVORABLE
FOR CANNING FACTORY
WATERLOO CANNING COMPANY
LIKELY TO BUILD FACTORY
IN MANCHESTER.
FARMERS MANIFESTING KEEN INTEREST
Over 200 Acres of 8weet Corn Sign
ed for by Farmers in Vicinity
of Manchester.
Manchester has another opportun
ity to secure a canning factory .f
present signs do not fail. A repre
compeiny spent several days recently
among the ffarmers of this Immedi
ate vicinity,, in an effort to arouse
interest in a canning factory pro
ject. The company operates a fac
tory at Dyersville, and the corn rais
ed on thp acreage this season will be
shipped to that city, but if the far
mers around Manchester manifest
sufficient interest in the project it
is quite likely that the company will
build a factory Pt this point before
another year.
Considerable interest has be&i
taken in the project by the farmers,
who have signed for over two hun
dred acres of sweet corn up to the
present time, and It is likely that
nearly one hundred more acres can
bo secured without much difficulty.
The oompany sells the seed to the
farmers at a nominal price, and
agrees to buy the corn the ear at
$9.00 per ton delivered to the car in
Manchester. It will readily be seen
that this figure will net the farmer
a neat sum per acre, when it is
learned that from two to five tons
can be raised on an acre. In addi
tion to the com, the farmer has the
stalk, which are said to be worth as
much for feed as hay is per acre.
W. J. Davis, manager of the Far
mers' Commission Company will be
glad to discuss the proposition with
farmers who are interested and any
wishing *o procure seed for planting
this season can gut it of him.
A canning factory in thvicin
ity would be one of the most valua
ble assets to Manchester and vicin
ity, and would be a source of reve
nue for the farmers. The project is
worthy of the hearty endorsement of
the farmers in this vic taity.

MONTICELLOO TO HAVE HOS
PITAL.
Readers of The Democrat, will note
with miich interest the disposition
which is to be made of the large be
quest for the poor of Jones County,
made by the late James McDonald
The-directors of the Moffticello Statfe
Bank were named as trustees of the
fund, and at a meeting of the direc
tors and representatives of the vari
ous clurches, lodges and medical so
cieties of Jones county is was decid
ed that tho fund should be devoted
to the erection and maintenance
of a hospital.
The Monticello Express of last
week contained an Interesting ac
count of the meeting and the action
decided upon by those present. The
Express says:
The directors of the Monticello
State Bank, who are also the trustees
of the residuary fund of the estate of
the late John McDonald, tendered a
complimentary dinner to a number
of invited guests at the Lovell house,
last Tuesdav noon, at 12:30 o'clock.
After the dinner a meeting was held
ir the lecture room of the public li
brary to discuss the best method to
bo pursued in the disposition of the
residuary fund of the estate of the
John McDonald. The meeting
was called to order by H. M. Carpen
ter, Sr- the president of the Monti
cello State Bank. On motion H. M.
Carpenter was selected as permanent
chairman cf the meeting, and Chas.
A. Doxsee, was selected as permanent
secretary. Chairman Carpenter called
for an expression from the guests
present as to what would be the
best method in the disposal of the
McDonald property.
Tho following men present express*
ed themselves in favor of erecting
a hospital at Monticello: Rev. W. H.
L. Schuetz, the pastor of the St.
John's Lutheran church, of Lovell
township Rev. R. P. Kuentzel, the
pastor of the German Reformed
church, of Monticello Supervisor
John Themsen, of Wyoming Rev. S.
Ide, the pastor of the German Luth
eran church of Monticello Dr. White,
of Oiin W. S. Beals, the editor of
the Hopkinton Leader Dr. Leonard,
of Cascade Dr. Gurnsey, of CHin Dr.
T. M. Redmond, Dr. C. G. Thomas
and Rev. Barr, pastor of the Metho
dist Episcopal church, of Monticello..
These men. expressed the idea that
the hospital would fitt the wants of
the poor of JOnes county in the best
manner possible. It was suggested
•i* sr***
•At, r« .•••-•-
®l)* Ufa
xufyaAtt WmottcA
MANCHESTER, IOWA, APRIL 26, 1916.
that those who were able to pay for
tho care should do so and thereby
help to support the institution. One
doctor, who spoke in favor of the
hospital, emphaz sed the fact that
the surgical part of the work cf a
hospital constituted but one-fourth of
the aid given and that three-fourths
of the treatment was for medical at
tention.
Those present who spoke against
the hospital or who favored another
plan were as follows: Rev. W. H.
Elges, the pastor of the Presbyterian
church of Scotch Grovve C. J. Cash,
the eidtcr of the Anamosa Journal
Dr. W. W. Hunter, of Anamosa
George L. Schoonover, the president
of the Schoonover Trust Co., of An
amosa Dr. Hejinian, of Anamosa
Dr. Pert, of Olin and A. A. Cole,
of Olin. These gentleman suggested
several plans which In their opinion
wculd mor»» ably meet and take care
cf the poor of Jones county, it was
suggested that instead of a hospital
vlsiing nurses be employed to tak
care of sickness as .t occurred in
poor families throughout the county,
thereby relievnig the diBtress of those
who were unable to pay for the nec
essary care. Another speaker ex
pressed the belief that the sanitari
um at Anamosa completely met all
the medical and surgical need of £he
poor of the county and that the
money might be better expended in
aiding poor people to gain homes of
their own, or to further the educa
tion in tho county and thereby ob
viate illiteracy and unhygienic liv
ing among the poorest classes. The
plan which is followed by the Mason
ic order in Iowa, whereby it aids
its poor members, was presented.
That organization has a board cf
trustees whjch is tup lamented by a
local board who see that the proper
persons are benefited by a fund
held for the aid of the poor and
needy members of the order. It was
the opinion of the speaker that the
McDonald fund be used in a similar
manner. Among the physic ana who
spoke against the proposition of
building a hospital, one suggested
that the sanitarium, at Anamosa,
would take care of all necesary hos
pital treatment at one-third the cost
of buildins a hospital in Monticello,
and that an additon could be profit
ably added to the sanitarium at Ana
mosa. Another suggested supple
menting the work of the board of su
pervisors in the care of the poor and
aLab he agreed with the plan present
ed w&ibh was similar to that used by
the Masonic order.
After, a great dsslxtf Hacgs#o« on
jmbject or
paftXttg &*. mcriiey te a uaar vwhi«}i
would do as much good, F. H. Shim
qp£k, j}t Oxford Junction, presented
jt£e^|lowlng resolution:
"RESOLVED, That it Is the «en.«
of tills meeting that on behalf of the
citizens of this and neighboring count
ties, we first formally express our
thanks and appreciation for the kind
ly, charitable and generous impulse
which prompted the late John Mc,
Donald in setting aside so liberal a
portion of his estate for benevolent
purposes, that the so-called John Mc
Donald fund be used in the erection
of and endowing in Jones county,
Towa, of a hospital or sanitarium
where poor and needy people can re
ceive, at moderate cost, or without
cost, treatment for physical ailments
th^t cannot receive proper care, oper
ation or treatment at or through the
public or charitable institutions -al
ready established.
'"We would further advise .and rec
ommend that not to exceed one half
of the said McDonald fund, nbw esti
mated at $150,000 be used in grounds,
building and equipment and that the
balance of said fund be held as an
endowment for the up-keep of the
contemplated charity, and that what
ever use be made of said fund in en
dowing or building, the name of John
McDonald be so connected with it as
to establish and perpetuate his mem
ory Jn a lasting and becoming
manner.
"We still further advise and rec
ommend that in order to add to the
annual revenue that may be deriv
ed from endowments and increase the
fund for up-keep and expense of the
building and equipment and for the
care and treatment of patients, it
being apparent that the income from
the probable endowment fund will
not of itself alone be sufficient to de
fray the expense of the care and
treatment of persons who might
not be able to pay, to so build, equip,
provide and arrange as to make it
practical to receive and we1! care
for other patients who may be able
and willing to pay for the service
rendered, it being clear from the
wording of Mr. McDonald's
bequest
that his intention was to not only
provide for those who might not be
able to pay, but for those who could
pay as well."
A motion was made and seconded
to accept the same. An amendment
was presented whereby a portion of
the first paragraph to the wor'
"that" be voted on separately. This
motion was lost. The original mo
tion carried by a vote of 39 to 6.
Resolutions were passed by the vis
iting guests from other towns thank
ing the directors of the Monticello
State Bank for their excellent din
ner and the ho8pitable^reatment ten
dered them while in Monticello. An
other resolution was passed by the
guests present who were residents of
Monticello expressing appreciation
for the presence of the out of town
guests.

REV. WN. SASSEN
CALLED TO REWARD
PASTOR OF SS. PETER AND
PAUL'S CHURCH AT PETERS
BURG FOR MANY YEARS.
UNIVERSALLY BELOVED BY HIS PEOPLE
Funeral Services Held In Petersburg
Church Tuesday Morning. Ac
complished Great Work.
Rev. William B. Sassen, the belov
ed pastor of SS. Peter and Paul's
church at Petersburg, passed away
last week, after an illness of sev
eral days. Funeral services were
held at the church which Rev. Mr.
Sassen had built during his active
years, on Tuesday morning, the ser
vices being attended by many
'rom various parishes in eastern
•owa, vany prominent clergy
men of the ol urch took part in the
services.
The Dyersville Commercial of last
week spoke in th* following terms
of the life and work of Rev. Father
Sassen:
Friends in this community, as well
as throughout the archdiocese of Du
buque, learned with keen regret the
news of the death of Rev. Father
Sassen, paster of SS. PeteT and
Paul's church at Petersburg. HIS
death occurred at 8:25 o'clock Tues
day evening, following an ilness of
but nine days duration. Father Sas
sen's health has not been the best
for some time, but his condition was
not such, that he was unable to at
tend to his priestly duties and he
continued to be able to be about
quits actively. Recently new com
plications set in and his condition as
sumed a serious nature during the
past week. For several days prior
to his passing, all hopes of his re
covery were despaired of. He was
57 years *f age. Father Sassen
was ordain-d a preat about 31 years
ago and took up **8 duties to con
tinue the work of man's redemption,
as outlined by his Master.
Father Sassen was a native of
Haselume, Province, Hanover, Ger
many, where he was born. May 28th,
1859. He spent his boyhood days
there and received a liberal education
in the schools of Andrup. In 1876,
he came to America and maite, his
hom® thip^ha^attrt^irg,
Delaware county. Iowa, of which he
was rect*»r t*m d«atti.
Early in
very special vocatfom, that of jHMt*
hood and he W^n^vrePaiatioi^ for
setting atf&rt from tje \WWdi° ^Ma1
life jffid 'giving it in a special man
ner to God. Accordingly, one year
After his arr.'val in this country he
began his studies for Holy Priest
hood/He studied the classics at
gt. Francis college, Milwaukee and
made hiB coucse in philosophy at
Dubuque College, His theological
studies were made entirely at the
Grand Seminary, Montreal. After
many years of study he reached the
first great triumph of his long hopes,
when he was ordained a -priest, No
vember 22, 1885, enrolled in the list
of Christ's followers. The ceremony
of the ordination, was performed by
Bishop. Hennessy, at Dubuque.
Taking up his duties in the vine
yard of the Lord, Father Sasaen was
assistant priest in St. Mary's par
ish, in Dubuque for about four years.
Later lis F§6eiiTSu~t!x appointment to
the pastorate at Brown's Station and
St. Donatus, Iowa. He was located
at Brown's about twelve years.
Rev. Father Sassen was appointed
to the parish at Petersburg in 1902.
He remained in charge cf the parish
up to the time of his death. His
success in that field is everywhere
in evidence. The congregation has
prospered. Soon after entering up
on his duties he realized the necessi
ty of a large and more modern
church. True and faithful to their
pastor, Rev. Sassen was given laud
ible support and assistance by his
parishoners, enabling the erection of
one of the most costly and hand
some structures in the archdiocese,
a work which will remain a monu
ment to tho memory of his zeal, am
bition and loyalty to his religious
cause.
The new ediffice has the distinc
tion of being the first consecrated
church in the archdiocese cf Du
buque. A requirement according to
the laws of the church, 'hat has to
be met before a church can be con
secrated, Is that it must be free
from debt. When the new SS. Peter
and Paul's church was completed as
a result of the generosity of the
parishoners it was entirely free
from debt find it was consecrated up
on its completion in 1906. The sup
port accorded Father Sassen by the
members of the congregation is
crowning evidence of their devotion
and good will for their pastor, be
speaking their appreciative interest
in his labors. Aside from the tem
poral betterment, Rev. Sassen's work
_n a spiritual way has been very
fruitful. He labored indefatigatly and
his efforts were not In vain.
Rev. Father Sassen is survived hy
one brother, Mr. Herman, Sassen of
Adrian, Minnesota, and one sister,
who still resides in Haselume pro
vince, Germany. He has a number
of other relatives in this vicinity.
The death of Father Sassen will
be widely mourned, for he was one
of the best known priests in the
diocese. He was sincere in his du
ties, loyal to the calling as a clergy
man, respected and honored as a
citizen, an influence in the com
|munity. His life was one of duties
well performed and he returns to
his Master, whoso cal'ing he an
swered in early life: "You have not
chosen me, but I have chosen you."
