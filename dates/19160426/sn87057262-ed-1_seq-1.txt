\^ar Minister Obregon to Demand Evacuation
on Plea That Country Cannot be Paci-
fied With Americans There.
THREE MEW REVOLUTIONS UNDER
One Ambitious General Has Already Crossed
^,x -the Line While Others are Awaiting
/the Proper Moment.
TBy B. T1 Conkle, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, April 26.—Speedy
withdrawal of the American expedi
tion will be Insisted upon by Warj
Minister Obregon in his border con-'
ference with Chief of Staff Scott, ao
cording to local Carranza officials to
day. Ths defacto government's plea
will be that 4t cannot pacify the Mex
ican nation as long as the United
States troops are in Mexico. It will
demand the evacuation of Its ter
ritory on practically its own terms. 1
General Obregon has reached Sal-j
tillo on his way north from Mexiooi
City. He can reach Juarez by Fri-
day if that city Is hie objective.,
Speculation still dealt with T^aredo or,
Eagle Pass as the possible location of
the conference.
While C&rranza officials pointed to
«i» reopelflttif45f PafflTTttfia Magistral
nines next week, ae an indication of
returning normal conditions, at least
three revolutionary movements were:
under way today. General Eduardo
iBoquer, formerly of Philadelphia, is
reported to have crossed into Mexico
east of HI Paso to start a new revo-j
lotion. General Salazax, who re-|
cently Invaded Mexico, was said toj
be heading for OJinaga. Carranzistas!
apprehend no danger from either of,
the movements as they have no fol-|
lowing or financial backing. A small'
detachment of troops were sent from
Juarez in pursuit of 'Boquer. Car-'
ranza secret service men are watching
Felix Diaz revolutionists who are
said to be making their plans in El
Paso.
Operatives of the Alvarado Mining
Co., the Companla Agricola and the
National mines and smelters will
leave Juarez next Monday to reopen
their mines near Parral and Magis
tral, closed since the Parral anti
American riots. The Qarranza gov
ernment has promised protection. The
operatives will be allowed to take
along their own rifles and ammuni
tion.
Trouble With Snipers.
COLUMBUS. N. M„ April 26.—In a
personal encounter near Satevo, Lieu
tenant Graham, of an advanced
American detachment, killed a Mex
ican who had ambushed and fired at
Mm, according to a report here today.
Officers on an Incoming truck train
also stated that they were fired on
by snipers within three miles of the
border, south of Columbus.
Excepting the column running
down the clue that Villa is in the
Noncava district, all American activ
ity In Mexico was confined today to
shortening and strengthening the line
of supplies. Urgent need for hay and
rough forage was Indicated by re*
iwrts that many horses have died
(ram the exclusive grain diet.
Details of the hard riding by the
'American detachments in the height
it the Villa chase, continue to be re
ceived. Thirty-two troopers in Major
Howze's column lost their mounts,!
hard riding wearing out the 'horses.
The bodies of two American sol-|
diers killed at Parral have been buried
In Mexico. If relatives request it,
the bodies will be disinterred and
brought back to the United States.

Await Word From Obregon.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 26.—
Chief of Staff Scott and General Fun
ston today awaited War Minister
Obregon's selection of a place for
their coming conference on the situa
tion caused by the presence of Ameri
can troops in Mexico. Obregon, last
reported at San Luis Potosi, may
choose Eagle Pass, Laredo or El
Paso, though officials here declared
the route to El Paso more dangerous
than to the other points. The Ameri
can army heads did not expect to
leave headquarters until notified of
Obregon's selection.
Neither Scott nor Fnnston knew to
day exactly what lines are to be fol
lowed in the discussion with Obre
gon. Instructiqns wore expected from
the war department today, however,
giving a definite idea of the matters
to be gone over and outlining the situ
ation as it is to be presented to
Obregon.
Funston said today that Scott and
he might postpone their departure
until tomororw.
Two Soldiers Killed.
COLUMBUS, N. M., April 26.—Two
United States soldiers were killed and
several wounded in a battle with. Vil
listas last Saturday, according to ad
vices received here today.
A column under Colonel Dodd of
the Second cavalry brigade defeated
about three hundred \illisas in west
ern Chihuahua. The bandits losses
are not yet known.
The meagre reports received here
stated the Villlstas apparently were
several bands concentrated under four
"generals." Dodd's men completely
routed the Mexicans, pursuing them
until nightfall. Many of the Vil
listas are believed to have been kiled
or wounded.

and nineteen wounded in a fierce
three hour running fight between a
small detachment of United States
cavairvmen under Colonel Dodd and
about 260 Villistas under four chiefs,
near Tomachic, Chihuahua, last Sat

Dodd captured twenty-five horses

Dodd's detachment unexpectedly
came upon the Villistas about 4:30

WASHINGTON, April 26.—Belliger
ents should presume an armed mer
chantman is peaceful unless there is
"conclusive evidence" to the contrary.
This is the position of the United
States officially declared today by the
state department. Merely because an
enemy merchant vessel is armed, does
not constitute sufficient reason for a
belligerent to declare it a warship
and to attack it regardless of the
rights of persons abroad.
These points were announced to the
world in a memorandum intended to
make clear the American position on
the general subject of armed ships.
The memorandum was aimed par
ticularly to forestall any question Ger
many may offer as to what the Amer
ican position is on "present methods"
of submarine warfare.
The ruling as to conclusive evi
dence was intended to define the
status of an armed ship on the high
seas. In neutral waters, however,
said the memorandum, the status
would be decided "from all the cir
cumstances of the c^se."
"A neutral government," says the
statement, "may proceed upon the
presuioition that an armed merchant
vessel of belligerent nationality is
armed for aggression, while a bellig
erent should proceed on the pre
sumption that the vessel is armed for
protection."
The document agrees with the Ger
man position that vessels in govern
ment service intended for hunting
submarines are warships. On the
other hand it disagrees with the Ger
man contention of a right to sink any
armed merchantmen on the assump
tion that it is necessarily armed for
offensive purposes.
The note declares any enemy war
ship "may properly exercise force to
compel surrender if an armed mer
chantman fires nrst."
The right to sink a neutral mer
chantman "in any circumstance is
doubtful," the memorandum declares.
The text of the memorandum fol
lows:
The Memorandum.
"By direction of the president, a
memorandum was prepared during
March, 1916, in regard to the status
of armed merchant vessels in neu
tral ports and on the high seas. This
memorandum is now made public as
a statement of this government's atti
tude on that subject.
"The status of an armed merchant
vessel of a belligerent is to be con
sidered from two points of view:
First, from that of a neutral when the
vessel enters its ports and second,
from that of an enemv when the ves
sel is on the high seas.
"FIRST—An ARMED MERCHANT
VESSEL IN NEUTRAL PORT.
"1—It is necessary for a neutral
government to determine the status
of an armed merchant vessel of bel
ligerent nationality which enters its
jurisdiction in order that the govern
ment may protect itself from respon
sibility of destruction of life and
property by permitting its ports to be
used as bases for hostile operations
by belligerent warships.
'"2—If the vessel carries a commis
sion or order issued by a belligerent
government, and directing it under
penalty to conduct aggressive opera
tions, or if it is conclusively shown to
have conducted such operations, it
should be regarded and treated as a
war ship.
PARIS, April 26.—An intense bom
bardment of Avocourt wood and Hill
304 by heavy German guns last night
was reported in the official statement
from the war office today, but no im
portant infantry actions occurred on
the Verdun front.
The bombardment was violent on
the whole front west of the Meuse,
but attained Its greatest intensity on
the French left. In the Woevre dis
trict, German howitzers played upon
French positions around Haudromort
and Ronvaux.
The Germans attempted to attack
a small French post near Ember
menil, In Lorraine, but were repulsed
with heavy losses. Prisoners admit
that the Germans also lost heavily
in yesterday's attacks against the
French salient at La Chapelotte.
North of the Aisne, French troops
took seventy-two prisoners in the
course of yesterday's attack which
resulted in the capture of a small
wood south of Bois Des Buttes. Sev
eral German reconnisances were dis
persed on the Paissy and Tryon sec
tors.
AEROPLANES BUSY.
PARIS, April 26.—A French aero
plane at three o'clock this morning
attacked a Zeppelin off Zeebrugge at
a height of 13,200 feet, throwing nine
incendiary shells at the dirigible
which was believed to be returning
from last night's raid on England.
The Zeppelin tilted Its nose skyward
and moved off, but apparently was

KEOKUK, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, APE. 26, *16
Position of the United 11 ates on
Armed Merchant I ien Question
"3—If sufficient evidence mat
ing, a neutral government, I -*ier
to safeguard itself from lial for
failure to preserve its neutrality, flaay
reasonably presume from the fast the
status of an armed merchant vessel
which frequents its waters. There is
no settled fule of international law
as to the sufficiency of evidence to
establish such a presumption. As a
result, a neutral government must
decide for itself the sufficiency of
the evidence which it requires to de
termine the character of the vesseL
For the guidance of its port officers
and other officials may therefore de
clare a standard of evidence, but
such standard may be changed on
account of general conditions of naval
warfare or modified on account of
circumstances of a particular case.
These changes and modifications may
be made at any time during the pro
gress of the war, so the determina
tion of status of an armed merchant
men vessel in neutral waters may
affect the liability of a neutral gov
ernment.
"SECOND—AN ARMED MER
CHANT VESSEL ON THE HIGH
SEAS.
"1—It is necessary for a belligerent
warship to determine the status of
an armed vessel of an enemy encoun
tered on the hign seas since the right
of life and property of belligerents
and neutrals on board the vessel may
be impaired if its status is that of an
enemy warship.
"2—The determination of warlike
character must rest in no case upon
presumption, but upon conclusive evi
dence because the responsibility for
the destruction, of life and property
depends on the actual facts of the
case and cannot be avoided or lessen
ed by a standard of evidence which
a belligerent may announce as creat
ing a presumption of hostile charac
ter. On the other hand to safeguard
himself from possible liability for un
warranted destruction of life and
property, the belligerent should in the
absence of.ponclusive evidence act on
the presumption that'an armed iber
chantinan Is of peaceful character.
"3—A presumption based solely on
the presence of an armament on a
merchant vessel of an enemy is not
a sufficient reason for a belligerent to
declare it to be a warship and pro
ceed to attack it without regard to
the rights of the persons on board.
Conclusive evidence of a purpose to
use the armament for aggression is
essential. Consequently an armament
which a neutral government, seeking
to perform its neutral duties may
presume to be intended for aggres­|
sion, might in fact on the high seas
to be used solely for protection. A
neutral government has no opportun
ity to determine the purpose of the
armament of a merchant vessel un
less there is evidence in tho ship's
papers or other proof as to its previ
ous use, so that the government is
justified in substituting an arbitrary
rule of presumption in arriving at the
status of the merchant vessel. On
the other hand a belligerent warship
can on the high seas test by actual
experience the purpose of an arma
ment on an enemy merchant vessel
and so determine by direct evidence
thse status of the vessel.

Goidmouth, after "being warned by a
German submarine to stop, imme
diately opened fire on the boat and
a half hour engagement occurred be
fore the vessel was sunk, it was
semi-officially stated today.
The submarine hailed the Gold

times before the crew surrendered
and one man was severely wounded.
The captain was made prisoner on
the charge of attacking a German

The Goldmouth's guns it was semi
officially stated, were attended by
two gunners belonging to the British
navy.
The Goidmouth was a big tanker

STAND IS EXPLAINED
may be determined, In the absence
of documentary proof or conclusive
evidence of previons aggressive con
duct, by presumption derived from all
circumstances of the case.
"The status of such vessel as a
warship of the high seas must be de
termined only upon conclusive evi
dence of aggressive purpose in tho
absence of which it is to be presumed
that the vessel has a private and
peaceful character and it should bo
so treated by an enemy warship.
"In brief, a neutral government
may proceed upon the presumption
that an armed merchant vessel of
belligerent nationality is armed for
aggression while a belligerent should
proceed on the presumption that tha
vessel is armed for protection. Both
of these presumptions may be over
come by evidence—the first by sec
ondary or collateral evidence, .since
the fact to be established is negative
in character the second by primary
and direct evidence, since the fact to
be established is positive in char
acter.
"Tho character of the evidence up
on which the statuB of an armed mer

neutral waters and when traversing
the high seas having been stated, it
is important to consider the rights

armed merchant vessels in neutral
ports and on the high seas.

"1.—It appears to be the estab

warships of a belligerent may enter
neutral ports and accept limited hos
pitality there upon condition that
they leave as a rulo, within twenty
four hours after their arrival.
"2.—Belligerent warships are also
entitled to take on fuel once in three
months in ports of a neutral country.
'3.—As a modo of enforcing these
rules a neutral has the rii ht to cause
belligerent warships failing to com
ply with them, together with their
officers and crews, to be interned dur
ing the remainder of the war.
"4.—'Merchantmen of belligerent

LONDON, April 26.—Prompt and
energetic steps were being taken by
tho government today to put down
the serious insurrection of Sinn Fein
volunteers at Dublin. The censor
permitted the United Press to cable
this fact, though It is impossible to
give details at this time.
Dublin was still cut ofT from tele
graphic communication today and ac
cording to the best available lnforma
tlon the principal part of the Irish
capital is in the hands of the rebels.
It is believed serious fighting between
the Sinn Fein forces and the govern
ment troops continues, though the re
volt thus far has not spread to other
districts.
The general postofflce captured at
the beginning of the disorders is be
lieved to be still in the hands of tlie
rebels. The Dally Chronicle pointed
out editorially today'that the official
statement from the press bureau last
night did not claim the recapture of
"an important position seized by the
rebels," and remarked that this omis
sion suggests that the rebels are still
holding out.
Information regarding the revolt Is
still confined to the official despatches.
The censor has passed no press des
patches on the fighting and tho Lon
don newspapers today fell back upon
editorial comment on the uprising.
For several weeks rumors that a
revolution was impending in Ireland
have been in circulation, some re
ports even fixing the outbreak defi
nitely on Easter Sunday. Tho news
papers generally took the view today
that the reports were no surprise.
"The outbreak will not comd Quite
as a bolt out of the blue from anyone
in touch with Irish affairs," said the
Chronicle. "Ever since the Ulster
volunteers set up their deplorable
example of open lawlessness and
armed defiance of the crown, the
temptation of all Irish extremists has
been to preach violence as the one
argument to which English rulo must
listen.
"Less than a month ago the Ulster
volunteers perpetrated a sensational
act of lawlessness at Breagh, near
Porthdown. A large detachment with
rifles and ammunition marched to a
hall being built by the Hibernians,
utterly demolishing it, and damaging

BERLIN. April 26.—President Wil

rines warn freighters, as well as pas
senger liners, constitutes the most
serious obstacle In the way of a
satisfactory settlement of the Oer

Other points at controversy can be
settled without any danger of a dip

that every enemy freighter is en

tions or other war supplies to the
allies.
There Is a growing feeling, how
ever, that there will be no diplomatic
