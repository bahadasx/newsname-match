Two Senators Head Delega

torial Politics- Plays Little
Part in Proceedings,
Composing their differences during
th morning hours yesterday after the
former fashion of their party, the
delegates to the republican Mate con
vention in the iifternoon and evening
held one of the moHt harmonious and
enthusiastic state meetings, in the
recollection of the oldest inhabitant.
A delegation which will stand five to
one for the nomination of Theodore
Itnosevelt for president, but which
was not instructed, was chosen
10 represent the state in the
Chicago convention. Senators Fall
and Catron head the delegation, the
other members of which are Congress
man H. C, Hernandez, of Rio Arriba
county, Dr. J. XI. Cunningham, of San
Miguel county, F.ufracio Callegos, of
Union 'county and Kduardo M. Otero,
of Valencia county. Charles A. Spicss,
f Las Vegas, was re-elected national
committeeman without opposition.
Senatorial and gubernatorial politics
played little, if any. part in the pro
ceedings of the convention. Appar
ently the leaders of both the Hubbell
Httrsum and the Catron-Homero
wings of the convention were afraid
to force the Issue. The honors of the
convention were distributed, as nearly
a possible, among the supporters of
both factions. It was evident that
the leaders did not consider it irood
politics to force the fight on statu is
sues at this time.
Late Monday night it seemed almost
certain that a fight would be made;
against National Committeeman SpleM
Sr.e.tltmu, liiir when Hm-lender
got together yesterday morning1 oppo
sition to the Las Vegas man began
gradually to disappear, and It wns
significant that, although thp conven
tion apparently was composed of a
majority of Hubbell supporters, Mr.
Kpjess, one of the principal supporters
of Senator Catron for re-election, was
really the floor leader of the con
vention. I'.oosctcli Sentiment Strong.
The one outstanding fact of the
convention was the clear demonstra

Noemed as if they were afraid to try
Ii out on the crowd as if they were
uncertain whut the result would be.
During all this time the delegates
gave perfunctory applause to the ut
terances of the various speakers. Thev
seemed to think it was expected that
they should cheer the vigorous de
nunciations of the democratic party
hiii) the predictions of republican vic
tory next fall, and they did what was
expected of them in the same sort of
way that men usually do things that
are expected dutifully but without
particular zeal.
It was not until Just before the
close of the convention, when Charles
A. KpiesR, who had Just been re-elected
national committeeman, responded to
numerous culls for a speech, that any
really spontaneous enthusiasm was
xhown. and that was at the mention
by Mr. Hpiess In a purely Incidental
way of the name 'of Roosevelt. In

Republican Platform
Adopted Yesterday
The republicans of New Mexico, ;n
stale convention assembled, reaffirm
their allegiance to the great princi
ples of the republican party, which
have become synonymous with the
welfare and reputation of the Amer
ican .people.
We congratulate the people of New
Mexico and the I'nited tSates that the
ruie or tne democratic party is about
ut an end, and that now u new era ! ' , . ,,,..,. ,. ,h m,tiIf... repulsed. Some of the Hermans ob
of good government and general pros- i to be obtained by the mltiga I
pcrlty will begin on the fourth day of
March next. We. feel that this is as
surer because the people have had
another opportunity to see that the
democratic party is utterly incompe
tent to conduct. the government in a
creditable manner, that it knows
nothing of constructive statesmanship.
and that it falls either to give satis
faction to the people at home or to lays and pledges the antes to mase
afford them protection abroad; thus their restraints on trade as little bur

have led us to the very verge of war;
these policies have been uncertain and
dilatory and detrimental to the best
interests und welfare of our people
and our country. They have stunted
and crippled our army and navy, hin

both of them upon a plane that has
resulted in absolute Insecurity to our

We believe that the democratic j

principles of republican government
and Is unable to Inaugurate a policy
which will satisfy the American people-
and in evidence of that fact we
point to the conduct of that body since
the inauguration of the nresent ad-
I ministration, during which time It has
ben in full power and had control
of both houses of congress ami or an
the departments of state as well as of
linn of dollars ln nronertv and tne
lives of thousands of people. The
policy pursued has only been a weak
ness. It has resulted in cruelty to
the people of that country and has
been a hindrance in the establish
ment of a stable government.
We commend to the attention of
the people of our state the able ef
forts of Senator Thomas n. Catron
and Senator Albert B. Fall and of
Representative B. C. Hernandez In
the congress of the United States in
the upholding of the republican prin
ciples of government and in the pro
tection of the interests and .industries
of the nation, and especially of our
own state of New Mexico.

in 1912 have been shown to be

Cannot Search at Sea.
At some length the noM argues the
Impossibility of making eearches at
sea, for various reasons, among whi::h
are the size of modern steamships, and
the manner in which contraband has
been concealed. A report from Ad
miral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of
the grand fleet, based upon his experi
ences of eighteen months, is included.
After summing up the circumstances
which It is contended work for less
hardship upon trade by sending ships
to port for searches Instead of search
ing them at sea. besides the added
danger of submarine attack while
search is In progress, Admiral Jein
coe's report concludes by saying:
Uimhtous as Possible.
' The difference, between the British
and the Herman procedure is that we

regulations, we examine

modern naval conditions will allow,
sending them Into port only where this
becomes necessary.
The note adds that a further reason
for bringing ships into harbor Is the
necessity for close examination of all
suspected persons, which has been
made necessary by "the Herman prac
tice of misusing United States pass
ports to procure a safe conduct for
military persons and agents."

Washington, April 25. Heneral
Alvaro obregon, minister nf war of
'the Mexican do facto government, Is
I expected to arrive at the border for
j bis conference with Maior Heneral
I Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the

I a' ,," latest. Xo definite word en
'to when he would reach Juarea wo
lecelveu today, however, either at the,
state department or the Mexican em
bassy, KmbiiHsy officials thought It possi
ble he might reach the border to
night. Advices from Heneral Car
rataiv indicated thut Obregon started
north last Sunday evening- A dis
patch to the state department, how,-
ver. Indicated that It was early Mon
day morning before hi train pulled
out. On this statement officials es
timated that be might arrive In
.luarer. tomorrow night, hut probably
not until the following, day,
Who Xnrciiv Will IU. .'
Heneral Scott will he' attended nt.
the conference by Major Heneral
Kuiiston, commanding the southern
department and In direct charge of
the border situation and tho pursuit
of Villa. It Is understood Henerul
Ohrccon will bring with him several
Mexicans personally familiar with th
, Hh.rn M.vlen i,,l u-tth
steps thut , have been taken by thelf
forces to capture Villa.
There were jio developments her
t.tiduy either In the military or dlplo
matic aspects of the Mexican situa
tion. Advices to both the state and
war department were meagre. Gen
eral Kunston forwarded delayed men
sages telling of the killing of 1 ft
trooper of the Tenth cavalry by -a
sniper nearly two week ago, hut Riv
ing no details, He also sent rotitlno
messages as to supplies; but no new
report on the re-dlsposltlon of hlH
forces In Mexico now well In progress,
nirrnna .Money Ih-prcelnte.
The stale department had report
of continued ulet In various parts of
Mexico and also messages Indicating"
that (lie presence of the American
troops beyond the border might be.
Influencing tho price of Carranii cur
' teticy adversely, nrfielnis thought It
possible tills was one of tho reason
that Impelled Currauza to urge with
drawal of the American forces. it
was pointed out that while the sol
diers remained In Mexico It was Im
probable that any loan could be ne
gotiated bv the de facto government
and that their presence uIho cast
( tioiigh doubt on the liiimediutc fu
ture there to depress exchange rntcs.
Ijist quotations fixed the prlco of Car
runzii money at one and one-half
cents on the dollar.
IVishlng Well Siippll'd.
It was announced officially (odaV
that the forces In
Mexico and on the
border now were amply provisioned
with slocks on hand large enough to
carry them up to May IS ot least. In
addition, the lines of supply leading
lo the big market centers Irom th"
border are so well established that
every emergency can be met prompt
ly by the tiiartrmus(er's department.
It lit understood also that arrange
ments have been completed to sup
lily (he cavalry commands beyond the,
border with additional mounts during1
the period of recuperation which is
to follow the re-disposittoti. Officer
here said the cavalry mounts un
doubtedly were badly worn by tho
long chase southward.
There will be no further develop
ments In the situation until arter tho
conference between C.enerals Scott
und Obregon unless the troops aro
forced to take some uctlon because of
attacks upon them. The whole mut
ter of the pursuit of Villa or with
drawal of the American troops Is at a
complete standstill temporarily.
Hit for, in" ut View.
There is much speculation aa tn
Just what will be discussed at that
conference- Mexican embassy offi
cials profess lo believe that it Is de
tails of the withdrawal of the Amer
icans which will he considered. Thut
is not the view expressed In other
fliiarters, however. It is generally
regarded as more likely that General
cott will urge Increased co-operation
bv carranxit troops In the stump
ing out of brigandage along the bor
der, or at least Increased uctivity by
the d, facto government's forces on
l heir own account to accomplish tho
tMino object.
It Is believed here that Heneral
Obregon will be given the Impression
that the American troops are pro.
pured to make a long stuV. on their
new lines as an outpost guard for tho
border. He will probably carry hack
lo Mexico City the conviction tha
they are to remain in Mexico until
the "danger of border raids Is definitely
removed either by Joint action in po
licing the douhtful areas or by th
demonstrated ability of Carrnnra,
troops to tak care of the situation.
Whether the capture or death of VII
la himself will be accepted as onu
f the elements In auch a, demonstra
tion Is not known.
Whatever conclusion the conference
bring to th two ofiUvtv it will hav
