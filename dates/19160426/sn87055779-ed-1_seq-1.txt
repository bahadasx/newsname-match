many's reply to the American sub
marine warfare ultimatum will reach
here probably Friday. Ambassador
Gerard today reported to the state
department that it is about complete.
Ir. von Jiethmann-Holhveff -was
scheduled to confer with the kaiser
today and will probably hand the
reply to the Amercian ambassador
some time tomorrow.
MTicials said today that any ef
fort by Germany to make an ac
ceptance of the American terms con
tingent upon a demand by the
Fr.ited States that Great Britain
abandon her blockade of Germany
would be resisted by this govern
ment. That is a matter which the
I nited States will handle upon its
own Initiative.
It is expected thf t a nw note
dealing with the Fr'.ti-h trade block
ade soon will be prepared. The joint
Anglo-French note defending the
blockade on the ground of military
necessity, made public last night, is
declared to he far from satisfactory
to the Fnited States Officials In
sisted today that the note, in declar
ing that new methods have had to
be used in preventing supplies reach
ing Germany, admits that such
methods are in violation of interna

The government wn bitterly crit

don papers today for not having
taken precautions extensive enough
to prevent an uprising. It has been
known for some time that the revo
lutionary feeling in Ireland has been
growing. This has been fostered by
the following agencies:
(1 The propsal that conscription
be extended to Ireland;
(2) The action of the British (
government in not allowing the home ;
rule bill to go Into effect;
(3) Tlie decree of the govern-i
ment cutting off the Immigration of I
Irish to the United States; ,
(4) The activities of anti-British j
and German agents who have carried
on a vigorous propaganda for many
months.
The temper of the Irish people I
has been shown by fiery anti-British
tirades in .ome of the smaller Irish
newspapers and the extreme reluc
