and Wife.
VICTIMS ARE MR. AND
MRS, A. M. GREENOngivy
Wife Was a Willmar Girl and a
Teacher in County Schools.
Couple was Married Five
Months Ago. Funeral atshocked
Willmar Yesterday.
In tlie morning hours lost Friday,
April 21, a heart rending tragedy oc
curred in Lake Lillian in which a for
mer Willmar joung lady, a bnde of
five months and her husband, were
burned to death in an oil explosion
and were found together but burned
beyond recognition The victims of
this sad accident were Mr and Mrs
A. Green, the wife formerly Miss
Hilda Ledell of this city.
The frightfully burned bodies of
the young couple were found at 9:30
o'clock, the husband with his arms
about his wife, just inside the door
of the kitchen in the new house on
the Fred Susens farm in Section 28,
which Mr. Green rented
At that time Oscar Johnson, a
neighbor's bov, came to the place,
having agreed to come and assist Mr
Green with some work He saw thru
the windows that something was
wrong and discovered that the house
was on fire The door was locked
and he rai to the nearest neighbor,
Stephen Adams, forty rods distant,
for help and came right back. Wm
Renstrom and Rev C. O. Dergquist
were next on the scene, and others
arrived shortly A terrible sight greet
ed the rescue party when they forced
open the door. The fire was not
burning very fiercely and was soon
put out The burned bodies lay just
inside of the door. A blackened five
gallon kerosene can lay on the floor
with the bottom blown out. A half
kindled fire was yet the range A
big spot on the floor in front of the
stove was nearly burned through and
the floor was also burned where the
bodies lay The pantry door was
burned Everything in the kitchen
was blackened and more or less char
red. There was a jagged hole in the
window and an old hat rim over one
hand of the dead man, which seemed
to indicate that he had broken the
window in an attempt to get air The
awe-stricken neighbors could do noth
ing further but telephone for the cor
oner. The roads were almost impass
able and it was five o'clock before
Coroner Branton was able to arrive
After lirvestigating all the circum
stances he concluded that it was a
clear case of accidental explosion of
oil while an attempt had been made
to kindle a fire, and the man had met
his death attempting to save his
wife. The wife had evidently been

fully dressed for she had her shoes
on, but the man had been in his stock
ing feet with his overalls tucked in
side and garters outside, evidently
with the expectation of putting on his
lubber boots.
The theoiy of the accident arrived
at is that the wile had been up first
and had kindled a fire When this
did not burn well she took the can to
pour on some oil The heated coals
produced gas and an explosion which
communicated to the can which waa
blown to pieces and soaked the un
fortunate woman with the burning oil.
Her sci earns quickly brought the hus
band who fought to extinguish the
flames and was overcome in the ef
fort When found his arms were
about Ins wife, placed theie probably
in an attempt to carrj her out In
the midbt of the suffocating flames
and gas, he had been unable to un
lock and open the door. There is
borne doubt as to whether the oil was
ieall\ kerosene and whether it was
not mixed with gasoline, tor kerosene
these das is usually not very vola
tile There was no use tor gasoline
on the place. There are no gasoline
burners or engines of any description
The can was a kerosene can The en
tire damage to the house will prob
ably not exceed $300
Atter consultation with the cor
oner a committee of neighbors con
sisting of Sanmel Erickson, Delos Mil
ler and George Harding took charge
ot the desolated home and with the
proftered assistance of the entire com
munit did the last offices necessary
to the remains a Christian burial.
Monday morning, the entire Lake
Lillian community gathered at the
house that had lost its inmates so
sadly on Good Friday morning, and
Rev O. Bergquist, pastor of the
Christine Lutheran church, conducted
services Those immediately in charge
asked the Willmar Tribune to express
their thanks and appreciation for the
manner in which all the people of the
community came forward with assist
ance and showed their sympathetic
feelings on this sad occasion which
the community as never be
toie in its history
The remains were taken to Willmar
Monday to Olson's Undertaking estab
lishment.
The double funeral took place at
the Lutheran Free church in tins city
yesterday afternoon at two o'clock
and was conducted by Rev. M. B.
Michaelson The large church edifice
was filled to its utmost capacity and
the occasion was an unusually sad
one The two caskets, laden with

ing pall bearers: Paul Holt, O Gil
bert, Peter Bassebo, W Stanford,
Alexander Sand, Severt Benson, Chas
Johnson, George H. Otterness, W.
Fredenckson, Olof Dale, Peter
Bonde and N O. Nelson.

came mentally deranged and the on
ly sister, Frances, after traveling in
the Southwest for her health, return
