U. S. Troopers Killed In Fight With Villistas
Congress Protects Income
Tax Thieves Who Rob U. S.
Oi 320 Millions a Year!
BY BASIL M. MANLY.
The federal income tax for the year ending June 30, 1915, yielded only
$80,190,694. The total tax collected should have been not less than $400,-
000,000. The nation was thus defrauded of at least THREE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS, and prob
ably more.
These enormous frauds were accomplished in the time of
the nation's greatest need and were perpetrated by many of the
same individuals who are now calling most loudly upon the na
tion for increased expenditures to defend THEIR PROP
ERTY from real or fancied danger.

WHO ARE THE THIEVES?
IS THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT WOEFULLY INEFFICIENT
OR CORRUPT?
These are some of the questions that must immediately spring to your
\am going to answer the last qoettion first. The treasury department is
not inefficient, measured by government standards, and there is not a bit <>f
evidence to indicate that corruption of treasury officials is responsible for the
enormous evasions.
Tho internal revenue bureau, which is responsible for the collection of the
tax, lacks the men necessary to enforce the tax under tho existing law and is
not organized upon the most efficient plan
BUT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT IS NOT IX THE FrRST
PLACE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE TO COLLECT TEE TAX
lhe original responsibility rests upon congress for introducing into the law
provisions winch not only invite fraud and evasion, but also make the detec
tion of income tax thieves virtually Impossible,
Congress invited fraud by providing for the secrecy of returns by impos
ing the same criminal penalties upon any person for revealing any informa
tion regarding income frauds or evasions, that are imposed upon the tax thief
avlio robs the treasury of millions.
Congress stimulated concealment of income by providing that income from
il?'l ion nnn °(l "Ot h° r^ovtod b* individuals unless the net Income was more
than ¥20,000. Congress encouraged evasion by providing that returns should be I
made only When the net income of individuals exceeded $:*OOO.
Longresß protoc'tjil the thieveg
by providing that 49 income tax
returns, although desorihed as
"pulinc records" should be open
to public inspection only upon
formal order of the president un
der the regulations ot the secre
tary of the treasury.
The president of the United
Stales and the secretary of the
treasury are responsible for the
continuance of the frauds, be
cause they have failed to exer
cise the power given them by con
gress to open the returns to the
public in order that the nation
might know who the tax thieves
are and assist in recovering the
millions which they have stolen.
NOW AS TO WHO ARE THE
INCOME TAX THIEVES?
The law effectually conceals
their Individual identity. Only
the United States treasury depart
ment is permitied to know, and
its officials refuse to reveal uny
definite information, although
Secretary of the Treasury Wm.
0. McAdoo admits In his unnual
report that the evasions by cor
porations alone amount to more
than $20,000,000!
