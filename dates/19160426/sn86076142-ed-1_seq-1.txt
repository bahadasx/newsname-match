WASHINGTON. D. C, Apr. 26.
The (lerman situation Is regarded as
having passed the crucial stage and
now the cabinet is absorbed In con
templation of what is going to be the
policy In Mexico. General Scott, the
man wbo Is famous for his medicine
talks and peacemaking appeals has
recommended that the troops now
across the Bio Grande, not alone be
permitted to remain on the trail but
be authorized to proceed as far lno
the interior as they feel necessary to
penetrate until the object of the puni
tive exedition is attained. Moreover,
when It comes to a showdown. Car
i an 7 a will be notified that the Amerl
can people will not tolerate any fur
ther Interference with the transporta
tlon of military supplies. If any ob
jection Is offered General Funston will
be authorized to seize and operate the
railroads to furnish facilities for ship
ping ammunition and foodstuffs to the
troops at the front.
This ia considered the equivalent of
an ultimatum. The order may be
amended but this Is what Oen. Scott
thinks should be done If the honor
of the nation la to be maintained.

Lord Winbourne, governor general
of Ireland is a prisoner In the hands
of the Sinn Fein revolutionists whose
bold stroke in capturing the post office
has aroused the gravest anxiety in
London. The uprising was greater
and better planned than first sup
posed. The rebels were well armed
and their movements were directed by
a master hand. Marked discipline was I
a feature of the outbreak which was
so well conceived that the authorities
did not have an Inkling of the con
spiracy until the insurrection actu
ally took place. In proof of this it is
heralded that the garrisons in Ire

PRINTER8 AT WAR
If the strets of Tonopah were quiet
last night it was due to the big noise
being centered in the home of the
Elks where a dozen lusty candidates
trembled over the thought that they
were to be subjected to he ordeal of
the third degree. It was not until the
night was far spent that their fears
were allayed and the candidates came
to the conclusion that the dreaded
goat was not such a fearsome animal
after all. After the ceremonies a ban
quet was served and entertainment
was furnished by Prof. Thomas and
Miss Zanette Whiting of the Butler
theater.
The members of the class were:
Howard Melvln, Round Mountain; Ar
