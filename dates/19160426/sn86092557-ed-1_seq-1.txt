ANNUAL OUTBREAK
OF MEASLES HERE
Health Authorities Have
It Well Under Control
It Is Believed.
The annual outbreak of measles
i that seems to be inevitable, is begin
ning to appear in Marion county, with
the almost ideal weather of the past
week for Its spread. Both the county
and the city Boards of Health re
port that the spread of the epidemic
is well under control and that the
necessity of even closing any of the
schools will not be probable. The larg
est number of eases at present are
in Maunington, but they arc all un
der the observation of the attending
physicians and are reported to be mild
er this eyar than heretofore. Practi
cally all of the cases in Fairmont are
in the districts surrounding the Flum
ing school on Virginia avenue. There,
are only about In cases in this scc-j
I tion that have developed so far.
To prevent the spread of the epi
demic In Fairmont, the school inspec
tor. Dr. IK S. Falconer, working un
der the direction of the Board of
Health, is dally inspecting all the pu
pils of tlie Fleming school and anv
| children that appear to have the first
! symptoms of the disease arc sen)
back to their homes. For the reason
! that the contagious time of measles
I Is worst in the first stages of the in
fection, placarding and quarantining
the disease aftor the diagnosis is oi
practicaly no benefit in its prevention.
The disease is commonly known ah
Tied Measles and is transmissabltj
through contact and the atmosphere
Tho patients that receive the con
tagion first feel a sort of cold in the
head accompanied by slight headache
ami failure of the eyesight.
That is the most dangerous time tor
the transmission of the disease' to
others and persons who have these
symptoms should never %uend school,
churches or theatres, as they may un
intentionally infect a large number of
other persons in this nionner. Although
measles are commonly thought to bo
harmless and a necessity for all child
den to undergo, this elief is not true.
Measles iu themselves are not particu
larly virulent, but they so lower tho
resistance of the patient that deadly
complications aro very likely to re
sult. Soveral deaths in the county
have boon reported this spring as due
to complications of measles and more
deaths result each year in the Uni
tes States from this malady than from
both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria.
Thus it is essential that all parents
in tho city observe their children
very carefully until the present cold
and damp weather ceases, or the
spread of the epidemic will be far
worsp than otherwise.
j The department was asked where
; the cats came from.
"Oh. Martin stole them out on th*
South Side." Bald one of the boys.
"Picked them up some place on the
J way to work."
When asked if the cats would have
the former domicile of Dick. Howard
Woodward made the following satte
oient: "These cats can stay just
wherever they want, and if they de
sire to stay in the horse stall, all
well and good. But I imagine they will

i OWNERS OPPOSE
INDEPENDENCE
| Send Strong Protest Against
Pasage of the Jones
Bill.
! WASHINGTON. I). C. April 2G.?
! Filipino property owners, proprietors
of agricultural holdings aggregating
? twenty million dollars have petitioned
| Representative Clarence n. Miller, of
Minnesota, asking that the Jones bill,
granting Independence to the Islands.'
be defeated. Representative Miller.!
who made a tour of the 'Philippines
two years ago. as a member of the :
Mouse committee on Insular Affairs,
in speaking of the petition today, said:
"The petition is significant in many
vital ways, in the first place, it is an
expression of the earnest wishes of a
large group of responsibIc_FHipinos.
It represents the real vIe"\VS of a* large
portion of the Filipino people. I have
long been convinced that the great
mass of the Filipino people have been
entirely ignorant of the independence
i agitation. Responsible property own
| ers heretofore have not seen fit to op
I pose the immediate independence agi
I tat ion carried on by a portion of the j
| people because they did not think in
dependence might come at once and j
wore willing to let the political leaders |
mnkc capital out of this propaganda, j
Immediately, however, upon the pas
sage of the Clarke Amendment in the
Senate, proposing to withdraw the sov
ereignity of the United States from
the Islands In from two to four years,
the responsible people in the Islands
found ihemsclves confronted with the
question of immediate indemmdence
and their response is immediate.
! I have had checked over the ninety
two names signed to the petition by
people acquainted with that locality
and I am Informed these are the lead
ing men of the two islands of Negros ;
and Panav. as far as the agricultural i
Interests lire concerned. I am in-!
formed that these men represent about
twenty million dollars' worth of prop-.
erty, they and their families. In addi
tion. the sentiment which they here ex- j
press no doubt represents the senti-i
mcnt o." prnctically all of the property- j
owning Filipinos throughout the Phil-!
ippine Islands, it is to be noted that i
Iheso men are farmers in the islands!
of Negros and Panay, where is pro
duced the great bulk of the sugar1
irrown in the Islands and where is to
be found the most prosperous agricul-{
tural area In all the Islands. I conshl-;
or this petition of the very highest im
portance. as presenting Filipino wish
es that ought to be respccted'by Am
erican people."
The petition Is as follows:
"We. the undersigned residents and
property holders of the islands of
Panay and Xegros. Philippine Islands,
and all Filipino citizens, respectfully
state that it Is our opinion that the
passage of the Jones bill in the form
that it was passed by the Senate of
the United States would be fatal to
social progress, to the development of
the commerce, industry and agricul
ture and to the political well-being of
jail the Inhabitants of the Philippine
Islands;
"Therefore, we earnestly beg the
Congress and the United States Gov
ernment and its citizens that they sus
pend nil action on the Joues hill, and
I that the question of the political inde
pendence of the Philippine Islands be
definitely suspended for a period of
twenty years, and that when this per
iod arrives that no action as to the
independence of the Philippine Islands
be taken without the vote of the Fill
pins people.

oil the evening of April 20, 1918. The

WILL SOON BUILD
New Structure Will Go Up
On Site of the Present
One.
Trustees or the M. E. Church. South,
located at Second street and Fairmont
avenue, are at work on preliminary;
plans for the construction of a new;
church on the site of the old one. I
The congregation a quired the ad- i
joining property next the present j
church some time ago. It is planned to j
raze the old building, which is now f
almost too small to accommodate the j
li of the congregation, and upon
the two corner lots build a new and
greater church, thta will rank as one
of the most beautiful churches in Fair
mont.
A few years ago the ground beneath
the present building settled because
of the abandoned mines beneath. It
is thought that the ground is now.solid
and has settled all that it is ever
likely to. To avoid any danger of fu-j
ture trouble from this cause, tbefouu
dationg of the new structure will be j
deep enough to reach below the miim.
1 if any Is found. The present idea of!
the trustees is to build a structure j
that will cost at least $40,000. j
Engineer Stoneking
Saves Money For City ;
Engineer Stoneking. at the city_wa- j
ter works, has saved the city several !
dollars in fixing the chlorine meter j
which regulates the amount of chlorj
ine supplied to the water of iho city
reservoirs. A few days ago this ap
paratus refused to work properly and I
the company that installed it was re-J
quested to send a man to fix th?; |
thing. . .T.hey replied that a man could |
be sent from New York but it. would
cost the local officials ten dollars a
day and the man's expenses. This be
ing thought exorbitant by the Board
of Health, the apparatus was taken
apart and with the aid of Mr. Stone
king was readily adjusted so that it
now works as well or better than ever.
There is a small capillary in the meter
tube that feeds the chlorine to the wa
ter. this contains a float that operates
something on the order of a carbure
tor on a gasoline engine. When prop
erly adjusted this tube feeds about six
ounces of liquid chlorine to 265.000
gallons of water. This tube being
clogged up was the cause of the trou
ble.

the train and each time lie scanned
i the bulletin board the train would be

ho made a trip to the station and
I saw the train marked up 11.30 a. in.

Lincoln District
Voting on Bonds
Beginning at 5.25 this morning, vot-j
ers of Lincoln district were all day
attending the polls to vote upon the
$650,000 bond issue for improved I
ronds. The polls are scheduled to close !
this evening at 7.11 o'clock and prac-|
tlcally every citizen on the registra
tion books will have voted by that
time. The present muddy roads and
the cloudy day failed to keep many
voters away, many because of the im
passible roads having walked several
miles to the voting place. That the
election results will be-close was the
opinion of most of the.representative
men of the district, although the ma
jority seemed to think that the bond
issue would carry. The county court
will meet Saturday to receive the offi
cial report of the election.
