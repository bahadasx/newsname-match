"Chairman McCombs has not resign

subject in terms embracing not the
rights of trade alone. It says in con
clusion: "His Majesty's government have
noted with sincere satisfaction the
Intimation contained in the concluding
passages of the I'nited States note, of
th intention of the t'nited States to
undertake the task of championing
the integrity of neutral rights.
Invasion of Belgium First Violation of
Neutral Rights.
"The first act of this war wr.s the
unprovoked Invasion by the enemy cf
neutral territory that of Belgium
which he was solely pledged by treaty
o protect, rne disregard of neutral
rights has since been extended to na
val warfare by the wanton destruction
of neutral merchant shins on the high
seas regardless of the lives of those
on board. "..His Ma8estys
government would welcome any com
bination of neutral nations under the
lead of the United States which would
exercise an effective Influence to pre
vent the violation of neutral rights
and thev cannot believe that thev or
their allies have much to fear from
any ccm hi nation for the protection of
these rights which takes an impartial
and comprehensive view of the con
duct of this war and judges it bv a
reasorable interpretation of the gen
erally accepted provisions of interna
tional law and by the rules of human
ity that have hitherto been approved
by the civilized world."
At the outset the note stie-rests that
the American complaint is not so
much that shipments Intercepted
really were intended for ue in the
European neutral countries to which
thev were despatched, as that the
derpntch of good to Great Britain's
enemy had been frustrated by meth
ods not hitherto employed by bellig
erents. New Devices Call for New Methods.
"It would seem, says the note, "to
be fair reply to such a contention
that new devices for despatching
gocds to the enemv must be met by
new memoes or sppiy'ng the funda
mental and acknowledged principle
of the right to intercept such trade."

Examination of Suspected Persons
The note adds that a further reason
for bringing ships into harbor is the
neressity for dose examination of all
sui-pected persons, which has .been
made necessary by 'the German prac
tice of misusing United States pass

As in a previous note in answer to
the contention that commerce of the
United States is being destroyed by
the Hritish Interferences, figures le
aned by the United States department
of comeroe are quoted to show that
exports to the Scandinavian countries
and Holland ir-read from 97. 000,000
In 191S to $;35.0OO.O00 in 1915..
Where Complaints Emanated From.
"In the face of such figures." says
the note, "it seems impossible to ac
cent the contention that the prise .
court procedure in Great Britain has
practically destroyed much of the ex
port trade of the United States to
neutral countries in Europe and the
Inference is suggested is that if com
plaints have been made to the admin
istration at Washington by woul-b
exporters they emanated not from
persons who desired to engage In
irenulne commerce with the neutral
ci..,r.trie. but from those who desired
to iupsi.-n iswof to he enemv under
coer cf a r.eutral destination and
who found the prize court under th
new procedure."
Goods Were Bound For Germany.
At this point the note takes nn tba
American contention that goods com
prising part of the common stock of
the neutral country to which thev ara
consigned should not be intercepted.
it reonca mat "the question by
whether goods despatched to a neu
tral port were intended to become Mrt
of the mass of merchandise for sale in
tnat country is one of fact." It de
clares that when the allies found It
necessary to intercept shipments of
cotton to Sweden "It transpired that
nrt the quays and warehouses of
Gothenburg were congested with cot
ton there was none available for th
ue of the spinners in Sweden." It
adds that contracts falling Into Brtt
lh hands proved that goods were not
Intended for the consumption of neu
trals to whom they were consigned,
but were bound to Germany.
Theory Versus Application.
"TTowever sound the principle that
roods In'ended for Inrornonitlnn In
the common stock of a neutral country
should not b treated as contraband,
