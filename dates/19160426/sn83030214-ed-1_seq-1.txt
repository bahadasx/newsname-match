Battle for Verdun
Another Gettusburg
Failure of Crown Prince Likened
by French to "High Tide"
of Confederacy.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
"Tho parallel between i.ettysburg in your < ivi! War ard Verdun in
the present r,iM?s' ,s unmi.stHkablo and itrikll n" This was aaid to tr.e
hy General Delacroix, one of .loffre's predeeessor* as chief of Ihe French
General StafT ar.d the dis*inguishe<i military critic of tho Paris "Temps"
now that beeause nf age he has passed to the retired list.
Wha' (.enoral l>elarrnix meant was patont and must have already
impressed many Amencai.s. Our own Gettyphurg was the tinal bid ff.r
deciBion of a South which had long heen victorious on the hattlefield. which
still pocaeafled tho armies that seemed tho b.rter orj/anirod nnd the .-pn
erals whose cnmpiiigns had beon wonderfully roceeaaftll. Hut it was tho
bid fnr de*ciaion of n Confederacy which was outnumbeml in men, in r.*
Fourcos. in tho ultimate powers nf endurance, and was already heginning
tn feel the growing pinch both in numbers and credit.
At Gettj iburg Lei made hia finaj effort to destrny the army which ho
had fr*w*uently defeated but never eliminntod. Viclory meant the fall ot
Washington, tho coming nf deppair tn the N'nr'h, an end nf the Civil W'ar,
which wrmlil bring indepondence. and the, prize for which they had con
tonded t.i tho c..nf<ideratea. knd Lea failed at Gettyaburg, not ai Na
polenn failed at Wiitorlno nr as MacMahnn failed at Sedan, but he failed,
and hil failure was th.- bcginning of the end. The victory of GeUysburg
put new heart, new nssurar.ee into tho North; it broke the long illu.iion of
an invincible ( onfed"racy; it gave to F.urope, to Ixindon and to Paris, ev.*n
more pmmptly thnn t<> Wa.shingtnn. the ur.mistakahle me4S.aa.re1 tfiat thi*
Nnrth was bnund tu win the Civil War.
I mcan in n mnment tn diseuss the militnry aspects of this ronflict
about the I^irraine fnrtres.. bul bcfoi*! the military it is essential to grasp
the moral cousequences of Verdun to france, to tha Allies. to Germa.'y.
Not since th.- Marne. r.ot even then beeause it was only after a lonj*
delay that France really knew what had hanperud in this struggle
hn< anything oocurreri that haa sn profoundly, an indeacribably. hear'.i d
the Kroni'h people as has the victnry at Verdun. It is not too much to say
tha' the victnry ha* been the most immediately inspiring thing in French
natk nal life rlnca thei duaster at Se<lan and that it has roused natmnal
cnnfidencp. hope, faith. a? nothing e\^e has since the present confiiot began.
F rrnrh Ssw Verdun ag linal Teat.
ln thii -ense rather than 111 the military sense Verdun was a decisive
battle and it'. eonaequencWI nf far-rearhing eharaeter. France as a whole,
fri.r.i tho moment. when the attaek began, understaond the issue; the battle
was fought in the open and the whole nation watched the communKiucs day
by day. It was aceepted a* a ternble if not a final test, and no Frer.chman
fail.s to reeognize in all that he says the strength, the power. the military
pkill of Germany.
And when the advance was cheeked, when after the firat two weeks
the battle flickered out as did the French offensive in < hampagne and the
former German drive about Ypres a year ago, France. whieh had held her
breath and waited. hoped, read in the re-ults at Verdun the pronu^e f
ultimat* victnry, feh that all that (.ermnr.y had. all that Phe ould produce,
