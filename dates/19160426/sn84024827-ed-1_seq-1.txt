"Big Army" Men Constitute
Membership Of Senate's
Committee. First Meeting
Of Conferees Held Today
WASHINGTON, April 25 Demo-1
erotic leaders in the House today fi
nally defeated the efforts of Minority
Leader Mann to prevent the army bill
from going to conference until amend
ed and the conferees of both bouses,
appointed later, will meet tomorrow
to work out final draft of the meas
ure. A special rule, adopted after brief
debate, paved the way for action by
the House. The rule permitted one
morion to recommit the bill, and it wa8
defeated.
When the Senate conferees wer
nnnc.unced there was much comment
on the fact that all "big army' 'men
had been named.
Senator Hitchcock, second major
ity member of the military commit
tee and opposed to a large standing
army, was not on the list. The con
ferees are Senators Chamberlain,
Beckham. Brassard, Dupont and War
ren .and Representatives Hay of Vir
jr'rin. Dent of Alabama and Kahn of
California.
For almost a week Representative
V. !rS 'he fight In the House
against sending the measure to- con
ference. He insisted UDpn having it
recommitted to the p'ilitary commit
tee with instructions to strike out the
provision for a nitrate plant. During
the discussion of the rule today, Mr.
Mann contended that a regular army
of at least 250,000 would be needed
for the first line defense if the coun
try were drawn into waar.
The nitrate plant proposal was at
torkeed by Representative Lenroot of
W'siconsin and I.ongworth of Ohio,
who declared it was placed in the
bill at the behest of the waterpower
lot by.
Representative Hay replied that
conferees, never would agree to this
provision until able to do so without
prolonged oonosition in the House.
A long nre'iminary wranele over
should be recognized followed, and the
Republicans, guessing that Representa
tive London would be the avored one
becpuse he bad voted against'tne orig

Mfnn had not. Britain of Illinois, a

London against the original bill, sent
in to the broach with a motion ,toi

rclonged by tradition to the minor
ity. "The gentleman from New Ynrit is
a minorit yin himself and 'he is re-J
cogn'7ed." the sneaker ruled, while
republicans stood ansrt and shouted
objection. Mr. Mann declared it
w-os democratic trick and motioned
the Republicans to remain in their
seats when the vote was taken.
