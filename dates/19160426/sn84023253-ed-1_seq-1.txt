Grisvvold and Mackinnon, an old and
favorably known business firm of St.

cure funds to take care of the large
shipments of grain and flour due daily.

ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY
Woman's Club Kxpects Lively Time In
Selecting A President.
The annual meeCtr.? ci the St.
Johnsbury Woman's club will be held
at Pythian hall on Monday afternoon
at three o'clock and some lively con
tests are expected as neither vice-president
will accept the office of presi
dent and there are a legion of candi
dates whose "names have been men
tioned." Then too this Is the year
when an entire change in the list of
officers is made and those who stay
at home run the risk of being elected
to fill some office for which they do
not care. For these and many other
reasons a good attendance is expected.

A PHYSICIAN FINED
Failed To Report A Quarantine Case
As Required by Law.
Dr. E. F. Root of East Burke was
brought Into Municipal Court last Sat
urday and pleaded guilty to the charge,
of not reporting a quarantine as the
law required. A fine of $10 and costs
of $6.50 were imposed which were
paid.
On Monday a man giving the namt
of William Green pleaded guilty to a
charge of intoxication and was sen
tenced to serve 10 days in jail. H
caused a great amount of trouble at
the police office having an epileptic fit
when coming out of his drunk.
Willie Hartwell was fined $5 and
costs of $9.75 for cruelty tc a horse.

passed as some details could not be
completed when the trade was closed
but they will be made out In a very
few days.
There are four houses and a barn on
the property, all of which are occu
pied and the tenants will have to be
given a reasonable notite to vacate be
fore the site can be tlsLured-for build,
ing operations.
Architect Austin will have the plans
out in a very short time, the awards
will be given and tuts work started so
that Company D may start drills in the
fall. The building will be practically
a duplicate of the two armories which
were built by the State during the past
four years at St. Albans and Bellows
Falls. The Legislature of this State
provided an appropriation of $25,000
every two years with which to build
an armory. The one at St. Albans was
built with the appropriation which be
came available in 1914 and the one at
Bellows Falls with the appropriation
which became available In 1912. The
money with which the armory Is to be
built at St. Johnsbury does not be
come available until 'after July 1 of
this year.
The commission accompanied by
Capt. Herbert A. Wilcox and Lieut.
H. N. Ladd ot Co. D inspected three
sites. The first was the Husband lot
on Eastern avenue where Architect
Austin said the foundation would be
altogether too expensive. Then they
inspected the property of Collins San
born, the old Underwood property on
Railroad street, but that was not large
enough. From there they went to tht
Burnham property on Main street and
as soon as the architect had measured
the lot he said it was tne only one
large enough on which a suitable
foundation could be secured and tht
lot was selected. ,
The lot has a frontage of about 132
feet and is 157 feet deep. The build
ing will have a depth of 130 feet and
about 86 feet wide in the widest sec
tion. It requires space for a drive
way at the side and for a driveway to
the rear and this is the only lot that
would allow these things. The build
ing will be an attractive one and wili
greatly add to the appearance of Main
street where so many other public
buildings are located.
Several Landmarks To Go.
With the disposal of the buildings
on the Burnham lot to make room
for the new armory Main street will
lose several landmarks. The oldest
of this group is the house now occu
pied by Charles French and the ear
liest account of this building is its
purchase in 1850 by George C. Barney,
This Mr. Barney was afterwards post
master in Buchanan's administration
and built the small building now oc
cupied by the Caledonia Real Estate
company .for a' postoffice. The affairs
of government were transacted In this
place from 1853 to 1861. Another in
teresting structure is that now occu
pied by Gill's music store. This build
ing was formerly on the lot where the
Athenaeum now stands. The ground
floor was occupied by Emerson Hall
as a general store while on the top
floor F. B. Gage conducted a daguer
reotype shop. Mr. Gage, the original
daguerrean was one of the town's most
quaint characters and many anecdotes
come down to us of his peculiarities.
This building later acquired notorietj
as the location of the town liquor
agency. The Caledonia Real Estate
company has the disposal of these
buildings but as yet they have not de
cided Just what will be done with
them.
The amount involved is not definitely
known but it will reach $100,000 or
more as the firm was obliged to bor
row immense sums to carry on its
business. What will be done in the
way of a settlement cannot be deter
mined until a meeting of the creditors
this forenoon.
The announcement of the embar
rasssment of this firm came as a great
shock to a very large circle of friends
as the members of the firm are widel
known. Capt. E. F. Griswold and
Robert Mackinnon have long been
identified with the business circles of
this town and were universally recog
nized as men of the highest business
integrity and this misfortune is a mat
ter of serious regret to all . their
friends. H. A. Stanley, the 'junior
member of the firm, is known as a
hustler and was considered one of the
active and successful younger business
men of the place.
Many rumors of the cause of the
embarrassment were in circulation
yesterday but the real trouble has been
the great jump in prices owing to war
conditions and the necessity of filling
contracts made at before-the-war
prices for future delivery with goods
that cost much more than the con
tract price and the delay in receiving
goods owing to the embargoes on the
railroads has caused the firm heavv
losses.
David E. Porter and Robert W. Si
monds were retained by the firm and
took charge of the business yesterday,
filling orders and receiving goods as
usual. Much interest will be felt in
the meeting this forenoon.

Health Shot Himself Yesterday
Morning.
Walter J. Dean, aged about 50, went
out in the yard near the barn at his
home yesterday morning and shot
himself through the heart, killing
himself instantly. Mr. Dean has been
sick all winter and it is supposed
despondency ' over his condition was
the cause of his act. He is survived
by a wife, one son and one daughter,
and an aged mother. The arrange

Forged Two Checks.
A young man who worked several
days for C. B. Weeks and gave several
names suddenly came up missing. It
was soon learned that he had stolen
some checks from a bank book and
passed on Lurchin and Lurchin a
check for $25 with the name of Joseph
Gauthier written on it. He also pass
ed another check for the same amount
with C. B. Weeks name forged to it.
Easter at Notre Damn.
Notre Dame church was a blaze of
light Sunday for the Easter services.
Lilies, ferns and palms, helped to
beautify the interior and the musical
program was one of the best ever
rendered in that church. Rev. E. C.
Drouhin, was the celebrant of the high
mass, assisted by Father Renondin as
deacon and Father Leveer as sub
deacon. A mixed choir of 3 0 voices
sang the mass, Mercedante in B flat.
At the evening service the choir ren
dered L. Lambrotte's "Alleluia," anS
"Tairtum." -An especial treat was the
presence Sunday evening of Miss Em
ma Lavigne, who has been studying
in Boston for the past two months.
But few knew of her intention of
coming home for Easter, but the news
quickly spread and many of her
friends made an effort to be present
Sunday night. Miss Lavigne sang
"Ave Maria" with a most pleasing ef
fect and her clever handling of this
difficult piece showed that great Im
provement had been worked in her
voice. John B. Henault played the
violin obligato for this number ,in a
very pleasing manner.
Called Out For ;ras Fire.
Hose Co. No. 6 and the Central Fire
Station equipment were called out Sat
urday forenoon to extinguish a blaze
near the river bank beyond the Ely
Works. Some boys were burning up
a shack when the neighbors became
alarmed at the flying sparks, and an
alarm was pulled In from box 67. For
tunately no damage resulted. The
chemical was called out again at noon
for a chimney fire in John FJnley'a
house on School street.
