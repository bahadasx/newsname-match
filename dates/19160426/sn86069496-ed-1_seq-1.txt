Everybody Laughed.
On Friday evening the students of
Lindsey-Wilson Training School, un
der the direction of Miss Bayless, pre
sented to the large and appreciative
audience the splendid three act com
edy, "The Time of His Life."
Each part was skillfully handled by
the characters; splendid training and
great talent being shown throughout.
Herbert Popplewell, as leading man,
played so well his role that the mem
bers of the audience fully decided that
they, as well as he, were m having the
"time of their lives." Miss SallieE.
Murphy as "Dorothy," the leading
man's fiance, was charming. Miss
Agnes Hynes as "Mrs. Gray." played
without an error a long and very
difficult part. Mr. Tye Faulkner as
Mr. Gray, was also at his best. Miss
Ruth Hynes as Mrs. Wycomb, was in
deed a "personage" and Mr. Howard
Garner as Mr. Wycomb was the "pes
simist" that kept the audience laugh
ing each time he described some new
ailment. Mr. Guy Stevenson, as "Un
cle Tom," the old Southern colored
butler, had every appearance as being
just from Dixie Land.
Mr. Oscar Capshaw, as the gentle
man with a "peppery" disposition,
was fine and succeeded in bringing
things to pass" wherever he happened
to be.
In short it was one of the best en
tertainments of the kind given in Co
lumbia for many years.

It was a hard pitchers' battle, Crouch

Both allowed but few scattered hits,
but Young had somewhat the better
team to back him in his excellent
pitching and at the close of the ninth
inning the score card registered 2-0 in
favor of Lindsey.

Shooting Scrape.
Last Sunday afternoon Alonzo
Johnson and Alfred Hurt, negro boys,
came to Columbia and went out to
the colored settlement. Late in the
afternoon they visited Press Williams'
store, and being drunk, they soon
started a rough house, so Press states.
They were ordered from the premises,
but did not leave. Press then went to
the residence of Judge Herriford and
had a talk with him, telling about the
conduct of the boys. Leaving the
Judge, Press returned to his store,
and upon reaching it, he says, the
Johnson boy remarked, "I am going
to kill you," and at the same time
placing his hand on his hip pocket.
Seeing this, Press pulled his gun and
shot, the ball entering Johnson's right
arm above the wrist. He was not
seriously hurt. A trial will follow.

enough to take on the chickens, a
large number of wagons arriving dai
ly at the landing.
