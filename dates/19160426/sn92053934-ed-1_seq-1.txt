Last Chance
To Enlist is
GivenBritish
London, April 26. Premier Asquith
at the secret session of parliament
yesterday presented on behalf of the
government proposals foreshadowing
general military compulsion unless
success attended "immediate efforts to
obtain men required by voluntary en
listment from amongst unattested
married men."
The government's proposals were
publicly announced today. The gov
ernment, Mr. Asquith said, "will forth
with ask parliament for compulsory
power," unless at the end of four
weeks ending May 27, fifty thousand
men have been secured by voluntary
enlistment. The same course is pro
posed if in any one week after May
27, fifteen thousand men have not been
secured by direct enlistment. These
! arrangements are to hold good until
two hundred thousand unattested men
have been obtained.
Owing to the length of time required
to sift individual cases under the pres
ent system, the press statement said,
recruiting to date has "fallen short of
requirements which were necessary to
fulfill our proper military effort."
CASEMENT TAKEN
TO LONDON JAIL
Charge of High Treason Expected to
Be Placed Against Former Polit
ical Leader of Ireland.
London, June 2(5. Sir Roger Case
ment, leader of the separatist faction
in Ireland who was captured while at
tempting to land arms from Germany
on the Irish coast, was conveyed
across Ireland Saturday by a strong
armed escort who knew the prisoner
only by two initials. He arrived in
! London without incident and immed
iately was lodged in the metropolitan
prison. .
The fact that Sir Roger Casement
has been brought to England to stand
trial and is detained in military cus-
Itody leads to the assumption that he
will be tried on the charge of high
treason.
This charge has been preferred less
than a half dozen times in England in
the last hundred years. The last in
stance was during the Boer war, re
sulting in the conviction of Arthur
Lynch in 1903. Mr. Lynch, who is
now a member of the house of com
mons was sentenced to death but the
sentence was commuted and a year
la;er a pardon was granted.
Washington, April 2fi. The British
ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice to
day received and referred to the state
department an anonymous threatening
communication declaring that any
treatment of Sir Roger Casement oth
er than that due a prisoner of war
of the highest rank would be a sen
tence of death against "him and other
English servants in this country."

AMERICANS IN
BERLIN MUST
REMAIN THERE
Right to Leave Germany Is
Denied Citizens of the
United States.
PUBLIC IS DIVIDED
Sentiment in Crisis With
Washington Is Split in
Two Factions.
Berlin, April 26, (via Lon
don, 3:55 p. m.) The Ger
man answer to the American
note may not be expected
before the end of the present
week. It may be presented
on Saturday.
Genera, Switzerland, April 25
(Tia Paris. April 26, 5 a. m.) Ger
man newspapers are now taking a
more serious view of the German
American sil nation. They say Em
peror William is expected to return
to Berlin from general headquar
ters. In the meantime Americans
attempting to leave Germany by
way of Switzerland are encounter
ing difficulties. Many of them are
held np at Constance, the Baden
frontier having been closed since
yesterday.
Paris, April 26, (1:30 a. m.)
The German-Swiss frontier has
been closed since Monday after
noon, even to malls, says a dis
patch to the Matin from Berne.
Foreigners now in Germany hate
been informed that none will be
allowed to leave the conntry be
fore 20 days haTe elapsed, the dis
patch adds.
Berlin, April 25, (7 p. m., via
London. April 26. 5:4 a. m.)
Chancellor Von Bcthmann-Holl-vi
eg and Admiral von Holtzendorff,
chief of the naval general staff,
departed for headquarters on the
evening train to consult with Em
peror William in regard to the
reply to the American note.
The chancellor's conference
with James Yi. Gerard, the Amer
ican ambassador, this afternoon
lasted for half an hour.
Public opinion In Germany respect
ing the American note remains divided
into two main directions. One, repre
sented by Count Ernest von Revent
low, the naval expert of the Tages Zei
tung, which is small but powerful, as
serts it would welcome a breach with
America with a feeling of relief. The
attitude of the other group is Indi
cated by a remark of Theodor Wolff,
in this morning's Tageblatt, that not
they but England and other enemies of
Germany would welcome a breach
"with a feeling of relief."
What will come of the deliberations
now progressing concerning the note
cannot be known or indicated In ad
vance but it can be said that the atti
tude of responsible leaders is plainly
that indicated by Mr. Wrolff and that,
whatever the decision may be, it will
be reached with a full appreciation of
what a rupture might mean.
Comment In the press displays a full
realization of the gravity of the crisis
which must be met.
Mr. Wolff criticizes President Wil
son's accusation that submarines are
sinking neutral ships In a preconsid
ered manner and in pursuance of
methods laid down for them, but he de
clares it would be a mistake to answer
with sharp words.
Washington, April 16. Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
In response to a request from the Ber
lin foreign office, has cabled sugges
tions for a course In the submarine
crisis which he believes will avert a
break with the United States. The re
quest from the foreign office for the
ambassador's suggestions contained
the statement that Germany was pre
pared to go to great lengths to pre
vent a rupture.
It is considered probable that Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg, the imperial
chancellor, took with him when he left
Berlin last night to visit the emperor
at grand headquarters, dispatches con
taining the recommendations of the
ambassador. As the round trip be
tween Berlin and the headquarters re
quires 40 hours and the chancellor
must have time to confer with the em
peror and other officials there, it is
considered unlikely that definite word
of the intentions of the German gov
ernment can reach the I'nited States
beforo the end of the week.
CLAIM DUBLIN
RIOT IS WELL
IN HAND NOW
Baron Wimborne Asserts the
Situation in Irish Capital
Is Satisfactory.
London, April 26 (3:35 p. m. The
following telegram was received in
London today from Baron Wimborne,
lord lieutenant for Ireland, dated
Dublin:
"The situation is satisfactory. Ste
phens Green has been occupied. Elev
en insurgents have been killed. The
provincial news is reassuring."
At the opening of the house of com
mons today Augustine Birrell, chief
secretary for Ireland, said it was diffi
cult to say whether any routes to Ire
land were open or closed. He added
that he was going there if he could
make arrangements.
Premier Asquith told the house of
commons that drastic action to sup
press the movement in Ireland was
being taken.
Outside of Dublin, he said, the coun
try was tranquil. The premier added
that steps were being taken to ac
quaint neutral countries of the real
significance of "this most recent Ger
man campaign."
Premier Asquith this afternoon read
a telegram in the house of commons
stating that the situation in Dublin
was satisfactory. It was not the case,
the message stated, that the rebels
had machine guns.
New York, April 26.-The revolt In
Ireland far exceeds in extent the ad
missions of the British government,
according to information reported to
day to have been received in Irish
circles in this city. A force of 10000
rebels is opposing the British gov
ernment authorities in Dublin an-1
neighboring Irish counties, it was as
serted. Reports had it that John MacN'eill,
leader of the Irish volunteers, had
been shot.
That the activities of Sir Roger
Casement were financed to the extent
of $100,000 by Irish-Americans, was
the assertion here today by Jeremiah
A. O'Leary, director of the United
Irish societies of this city and presi
dent of the American Truth society.
Mr. O'Leary and other . prominent
Irish-Americans here who favor
Irish independence insisted, however,
that there was no connection between
Casement's expedition and the Dub
lin trouble. Plans are being made
for a massmceting to be held Sunday
night at which Sir Roger Casement's
expedition and the Dublin revolt will
be endorsed, Mr. O'Leary anounced.
The meeting is being arranged by
the United Irish-American societies
of the city.
Earth Shocks Recorded.
Washington, April 26. Two earth
shocks occurred during the night, the
first beginning at 9:27 p. m. and the
second at 2:23 a. m. The first dis
turbance was the more severe, its
maximum vibrations being recorded
on Georgetown University seismo
graphs between 9:36 and 9:40 p. m.
It was estimated the distance from
Washington was 2,200 miles. The
movement was east and west
A NEW EXCUSE
CHIEF POINTS MADE
IN BRITISH ANSWER
Washington, April 26. Here are the
chief points in the British note to the
United States in reply to the protest
against allied interference with neu
tral trade:
His majesty's government would
welcome any combination of neutral
nations under the lead of the United
States which would exert an effective
influence to prevent the violation ot
neutral rights, and they cannot be
lieve that they or their-jjlies have
much to fear from such a combination.
Cotton consigned to Sweden but not
purchasable by Swedish spinners,
meat products consigned to dock la
borers and other shipments to ir
responsible or fictitious consignees
have demonstrated that much contra
band is forwarded ostensibly for in
corporation in the "common stock" of
merchandise in neutral countries, but
really destined for the enemy.
New devices for dispatching goods
to the enemy must be met by new
methods of applying the fundamental
and acknowledged principle of the
right to Intercept such trade.
The activity of German submarines,
German misuse of American pass
ports, the reported attempts to con
ceal contraband In innocent packages,
and the difficulty and danger of search
ing large merchantmen at sea, par
ticularly in rough weather, make it
necessary to take cargoes into British
ports for examination.
While the Germans in some cases
have taken American ships into port
for examination, the British "instead
of sinking neutral ships engaged in
trade with the enemy, as the Germans
have done in so many cases," have
acted "in the way which causes the
least discomfort to neutrals."

ATTITUDE ON
ARMED SHIPS
IS OUTLINED
President Wilson Announces
Stand of Country on
Sea Problem.
Washington, April 26 A statement
defining the attitude of the United
States toward armed merchant ships
was made public today by the state
department by direction of President
Wilson. It originally was prepared
as a circular note to other powers but
it later was decided to Issue it as a
statement.
The statement holds to the right of
a merchant ship to arm for protec
tion only but declares that "merchant
men which used their armaments for
aggressive purposes are not entitled
to the same hospitality in neutral
ports as peaceable armed merchant
men." "The status of an armed merchant
vessel of a belligerent," says the
statement, "is to be considered from
the point of view of a neutral when
the vessel enters its ports and from
that of an enemy when the vessel is
on the high seas."

which made a raid over the east coast
last night remained at a great height
probably because they were subjected
to violent fire from anti-aircraft euns.
The raiders were favored by the dark
night and light wind but were forced
to flee after a short time.
A correspondent from Essex countv
says a Zeppelin 'was picked up by a
searchlight at the outskirts of the
county and in a few minutes was out
lined by other searchlights. Shrapnel
began to burst around it from many
directions. The Zeppelin climbed very
high and hovered about for ten min

bombs were dropped after the search
lights found it.
The number of casualties and extent
of the damages caused by the raid
