PEACE TELEGRAMS
FROM ONE SOURCE
Arms Embargo Body Said to Be
Back of Messages to Con
gressmen. Hcnators and House members have
no further question that tho unpre
cedented number or telegrams protest
ing a'galnBt trouble with Germany havo
been inspired by a common source.
Senator Stono of Missouri, chairman
of tho Foreign Relations Committee,
had In his hllnds today a circular let
ter In which persons receiving It were
requested, to wire their members of
Housa and Senate. Five dlffcront
forms of telegrams were submitted and
tho recipient Invited to pick cither of
them. Senator Stone did not give out
tho namo of tho person or organiza
tion signing tho letter.
In other qunrters, nowevcr, an or
ganization styling itself tho Arms Km
bnrgo Conference Is said to bo back
of tho movement. Various Uerman
Amcrlcan societies nro credited with
urging it along.
Some talk was heard today about n.
Congre'stilonat Investigation by tho lob
by committee. However, this has not
taken form, and as momherfl view the
right of petition as sacred such an
inquiry would probably not get tar.
More Telegrams Today.
Another enormous flood of telegrams
rolled over tho Capitol today.
From all the leading cities of the
country and a, number of smaller cen
ters, tho telegrams protesting against
a break with Germany and against war,
and urging pcaco are coming.
Night before last, it was estimated
2E.0W euch telegrams reached Washing
ton. Lrsl night tho number was still
greater. It Is estimated all the way
from :o,ooc to 35.000.
Many Letters As Well.
Moreover, It Is said tho end is no
whero in sight, and that before the
propiganda Is over a halt million tele
grams, to say nothing of many letters,
will have been sent to Washington,
That th movement represent an or
ganized effort Is no longer open to
doubt. No inch dolugo of messages,
has ever beforo overwhelmed tjenatottt
and Roprctcntatlvi's. Cities like Chi
cago. St. Louis, Milwaukee Buffalo,
Cincinnati. Now York and others where
there uro large German-American popu

PROSECUTOR ALSO SUMS UP
NKW YOniC. April 26. Demand that
Mrs. Ida Snlffen Walters Itogera be put
to death In the electric chair or aet ab
solutely free on the charge of poison
ing her two babies by the administra
tion of bichloride of mercury waa made
by her own counsel to the jury In his
closing arguments today.
"We want no compromise," he said.
"I ask you to give Mrs. Rogers her lib
erty or givo her death."
"These mothers who have come here
to testify did so because they believed
In Mrs. Rogers," continued Attorney
Chanter. "Do you think there Is a
slnglo mother In all the world who
would come hero In her behalf If aba
thought that this woman had deprived
her babies of their lives In cold blood?
And these women know tho feeling of a
mother toward her babies far hotter
than the male experts for the prosecu-
Pr'osccutor Martin urged the Jury to
return a verdict of first degree mur
der. He declared that the State by the tes
timony of three alienists, has met the
Plea of the defense: that Mrs. Rogers
was Insane when she fed bichloride of
mercury to little "Jackto" o6V Lorlria
and has proved that she poisoned the
children only because she believed she
could not marry their father, Lorlya
Elton Rogers,, the attorney.
Two Jurors Weep.
Two of the Jurors, all of whom are
married men, wept.
"I defend neither the life Mrs. Rogers
lived, nor what the man Rogers did,"
said Chanlcr, "but I do say she loved
her babies and nevei would hove killed
them If she had been sane: and I do say
that Rogers has been a real man ever
since tho night the babies died.
"Humanity and motherhood stand be
fore you at the bar and you cannot In
Justice to them, do anything but bring
this miserable and unhappy woman a
speedy and full deliverance."
Rogers' first wife, Anna Duprce Rog
ers, was the only woman and almost
tho only Qerion In the court room who
was not weeping as Attorney Chanter
closed the final plea for the black
garbed and heavily veiled defendant.
Mrs. Rogers Faces Jury.
As Chanler portrayed the defendant
to the Jury as "a gentle, refined, and In
nocent woman, or n field at the time of
the murder and a fiend as she sits here
before you," Mrs. Rogers for tho first
time durlngthe trial threw back her
veil and turned slowly In her chair to
face the twelve men.
A moment she gazed at them, calmly,
then broke down and cried. She sat
alone. Her attorneys were at a tablo
several feet from her. Rogers, sobbing,
sat across the room from the mother of
the slain children.

The Carranza government has promised
