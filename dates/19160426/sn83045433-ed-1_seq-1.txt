by the Sinn Feiners, the ultra-radical
Irish organization, has broken out in
Dublin. the capital . ' -' . For twen
ty-four hours bitter street fighting has
been In progress, and, at last accounts,
late tonight, was still raging in full
swing.
Augustine Birrell, chief secretary for
Ireland, announced in the house of com
mons this afternoon that the government
had the situation "well in hand."
Twelve men had been killed on the gov
ernment's side, Secretary Btrrell stated.
according to the last report received by
him from Dublin. The number of casual
ties among the rebels Is not known. It
Is believed to be considerably heavier,
as they were facing an organized milI
tary force.
Four or five parts of Dublin were in
the hands of the rebels when the secre
tary last heard from Dublin. The post
offlee, which had been seized by them
in their first rush against the govern
ment buildings, was retaken by govern
ment troops this afternoon. Later to
night Secretary Birrell stated that "the
rebels are not in possession of the whole
city."
The casualties on the government's side
were given out by the official press bu
reau as follows: Dead, three military of
fcers, four or five soldiers, two "loyal
volunteers," two peleemen; wounded,
four or five military officers, seven or
eight saldiers, six "loyal volunteers."
Colaaed to Dublin.
Dispatches from several parts of Ire
land late tonight agreed that thus far
the revolt has not spread beyond Dublin.
The official press bureau stated tonight
that reports from Cork. Limerick and
Ennis, capital of the County Clare,
twenty miles west-northwest of Limerick,
as well as from Tralee, a seaport and
capital of County Kerry, fifty-nine miles
west-northwest of Cork, and from both
ridings of Tipperary, were to the effect
that no disturbances of any kind had
occurred in these localities.
The news of the Dublin revolt struck
Parliament like a thunderbolt. The house
assembled this morning for the epoch
making secret session to listen to the
government baring all the facts concern
ing Great Britain's military status, with
e. view to determining how far the coun
try must go with compulsion. Immediate
ly after the members had taken their
scats, Commoner Craig put the question
to Chief Secretary Birrell whether he had
not something to report from Dublin.
Mr. Birrell quickly rose and with
a calm voice announced: "Grave dis
turbances have broken out in Dublin.
The postoffice has been forcibly pos
sessed. Military forces have arrived
and the situation is well In hand.
Twelve lives were lost."

had been almost completely successful,
and that the Irish volunteers had cap
tured and held as hostage Lord Wim

other high English officials. One ver
sion sala the entire English staff were

for Irish freedom or further concessions
to Ireland, but also that his life would
be forfeited if Sir Roger Casement were
executed. Lord Wimborne and the other
officala were said to be guarded by Irish
volunteers.
This message was said to be contained

and no fearful are the county authorities
that they will not be able to cope with

Thomas J. Stewart today directed the
commanding officer of the Tenth and
Eighteenth Infantry regiments, and a
cavalry troop of the National Guard to
prepare for mobilization for strike duty.
Whether these troops will be called out
depends entirely on Gov. Martin G.
Brumbaugh.
The most Important development In the
big strike was the announcement today
that 4,000 street car employee would walk
out on May 1 unless their demands, made
some time ago, on the Pittsburgh Rail

GERMANY MAY

Berlin's Answer to Last Note
Expected to Meet
Demands.
LIKELY TO ASK HELP TO
END BRITISH BLOCKADE
(By the sga Ness. Service.)
Berlin, via Amsterdam, April 25.-With
in twenty-four hours-forty-eight at the
outside-Germany will have dispatched
across the Atlantic her answer to Pres
(dent Wilson's last word on the subma
rine issue.
That answer will decide-for the time
being, at least-the question of war or
peace between Germany and the United
States.
An impenetrable veil of secrecy, un
precedented here since the war began,
keeps the German people from discern
Ing even the vaguest outline of thefi
government's deelsion.
Yet this much they already know: The
Kaiser will go to the greatest possible
length in endeavoring to keep peace wit
Amerlea. In forming its answer to the
United States, the German government
sees itself confronted with the gigantic
task of bridging not only the great cleav
as which at the present moment exists
between the two nations, but at the same
time conciliating its own people.
In well-inforned-though unoffici
quarters, the following hypothetical
answer has been whispered as "the one
way out."
"With the greatest reluctance, but
prompted by the sincere wish that the
friendly relations between thne two na.
lions Gontlnue, ws offer to accede to the
American demands by temporarily dis

English Warships Bombard German
Positions Along Belgian Coast
Damaging War Vessels.
(By laternational News Uswies.)
London. April 26.-A remarkable
battle of airships, war vessels and un
dersea craft was fought off the north
east coast of England just as dawn
was breaking today.
A German cruiser squadron, accom
panied by Zeppelins and submarines,
bombarded Lowestoft. 100 miles north
east of London at 4:30 a. in., and was
driven off after a twenty-minute bat
tle in which British light cruisers,
destroyers and aeroplanes took part.
A graphic account of the unprece
dented fighting which raged simul
taneously on the sea, above the sea
and under the sea, is given in an of
ficial statement issued tonight by the
admiralty. The statement says:
"During the operations against the
German battle cruiser squadron off
the east coast this morning two Zep
pelins were pursued by naval and land
machines over sixty miles out to sea.
Bombs and darts were dropped but
apparently without serious effect.
Seaplanes Atteek Ships.
"An aeroplane and a seaplane at
tacked the German ships off Lowes
toft, dropping heavy bombs. Four
German submarines also were attacked
by bombs. One seaplane came under
a heavy Are from the hostile fleet
but the pilot, though seriously wound
ed, succeeded in bringing his machine
safely back to land. It is regretted
that one pilot is reported missing. He
ascended during the Zeppelin raid earl
ter in the morning and appears from
reports to have attacked a Zeppelin
off Lowestoft at about 1:06 a. m. He
has not been heard from since. About
seventy bombs were dropped in the
Zeppelin raid on Norfolk and Suffolk
counties.
"one man is reported injured."
In addition to the missing pilot the
British suffered damage to two light
cruisers and a destroyer.
The damage of the bombardment of
Lowestoft is said to have been small
Two men. one woman and a child were
killed in their beds.
Zeppelias Aceompa-y Fleet.
The fight was the climax of a day of
unusual activity by sea and air fleets.
The German warships crossed the North
Sea in the wake of a feet of Zeppelins,
four or five In number, which appeared
over the Norfolk coast between 10S0 and
11 o'clock last night and dropped seventy
incendiary bombs. The real object of
the dirigibles, apparently, was to deter
mine whether the path was clear for the
warships. Radio dispatches are believed
to have started the naval force on its
way.
The German raid on England followed
a fierce bombardment by British war
ships of the German positions along the
Belgian coast cesterday. First news of
this action was received today by was
of Amsterdam. Heavy damage is said to
have been inflicted and seversI destroy
ers and other light (raft were driven into
the harbors. Several of these vessels are
reported to have been hit and sunk.
In retaliation for the sea attack, five
German battle planes descended yeater
day evening on the French port of Dun
kirk, dropping five bombs. A French
war office report says one woman was
killed and three men wounded. The ma
terial damage was slight.
