LESSON TO
FIELD HEADQUARTERS, April
20. (By motor courier to Columbus, 1
N. M., April 24.) There are mdica-i
tions in the Villa territory in Mexico
that the work of the punitive expe
dition under General J. J. Pershin
has teen accomplished. This work
according to press reports received
here from Washington, did not in
elude the death or the capture of
"Pancho" Villa. The announced pur
pose was the dispersal of Villista-
and the establishment of safety for
the American border.
The Villistas have been dispersed
for several weeks, or else driven al
most completely out of the State of
Chihuahua, to a distance of nearly
500 miles south of the American
boundary. Throughout this territory
the people have been impressed with
two facts which have inspired re
spect for American soldiers. These
are that when Americans shoot, they
kill; and that a handful of Ameri
cans cannot be successfully attacked
by superior numbers.

pull him out on the grade with the
latter's motor car, which was done.

Crozicr's car proved too heavy, and
Stocking was left behind, his car re
fusing to work, Crozicr going down
the line with his full crew to begin
the day's work. Reaching Willow
creek. Crozicr concluded to turn back
toward the city, to offer assistance to
Stocking, in case trouble continued
with the latter's car. Reaching the
fatal point where the collision took
place, Crozicr instantly realized the
danger impending, by seeing Stock
ing on his knees looking under at the
mechanism, in an effort to adjust the
carburetor. Giving the alarm to
Stocking, who was coming down the
grade at a terrific pace, about 75 feet
away, Crozier stepped from his car,

thrown 20 feet beyond Crozicr's car,
and an examination showed that he
was injured from head to foot. He
was immediately brought to the city.

can boy. who fortunately escaped
with a few bruises only, by rcmaininR

It has been suggested that an
