The operetta, "The American Girl,"
given by the girls' glee club of Barton
academy, Friday evening, under the
direction of Miss Edith D- Ruggles,
teacher of music, was certainly a credit
to any high school, and gave evidence
of the large amount of musical talent
among the students of our. school,
which only needs development to be
come a real factor in the community.
It vss the most elaborate musical

(The following sermon, repeated by

I. A. Ranney and since given before a
preachers' meeting in Barre. and a
Newport audience, is now printed.)
Tb titani 6 struggle in which the
principal nations of Europe ' are now
engaged, and which threatens to
embroil the whole world, ha3. the
history of nineteen centuries inter-.
woven in it and is an outgrowth of the
pressure of population and land hunger,
militarism and greed, race prejudice
and jealousy, and surpasses in magni
tude, all previous wars in the history
of the world.
Nations once counted their dead by
the thousand ; now they number their
fallen sons by the million. Once they
computed their expenses in millions;
now they reckon in billions. The effect
of this war is seen and felt in every
department of life, economic, social,
political, commercial, ethical, religious.
Probably no two persons look at it
from the same standpoint, therefore it
presents a different phase to every
man. However, all most lament a
calamity so far-reaching, so ruinous in
its effects. All Europe, 33 well as our
sister on the north, is drenched with
blood. Every day adds its quota to the
list of widows and orphans, blighting
human hopes and blasting human loves
Every day marks the destruction ot
millions of dollars worth of property,
public and private, sees colossal for
tunes swallowed up in the vortex of
war, threatening to engulf the nations
in hopeless bankruptcy. Every day
the tide of civilization in Europe is
setting backward, making the expres
sion, "Christian England," or "Christ
ian Germany." a byword among the
enemies of the Cross, even shaking the
faith of multitudes of the professed
followers of Jesus in the Father's
wisdom and love and power. - Unbe
lievers are asking: "Where is now
that God who holdeth the world in His
hands, and ruleth over the nations of
the earth, and yet alloweth such things
to be?" Probably nothing in human
history has so profoundly stirred men
everywhere. Coming at a time when
it was generally thought that war was
a thing of the past, at least a war of
such alarming proportions ; that arbi-

Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
The subject of the morning sermon
was "The Question of the Ages," the
text from Job 14-14. being, "If a man
die shall he live again?" The sermon
proved conclusively that Christ lived,
died, arose and ascendsd into heaven,
and because He lives, man has a right
to believe in his own immortality.
The Watch service held by the
Christian Endeavor and Epworth
League on Sunday morning was led by
W. H. Gilpin. All those present found
the service extremely helpful and
expressed a desire to have more morn

anniversary of Rev. and Mrs. M. W.

proceeding had been cariied on for

mystery, and even when the parson
wa3 defeated in gaining an entrance to
the church that he might show to a
friend the memorial windows, he did
not dream that inside was a trio carry
ing out a plot for the evening's enter
tainment, but gave "Jack Jrost" the
honor of having made havoc with the
church underpinning and informed this
friend that he would have to call again.
To this friend the mystery was
already solved, he having been pre
viously informed and requested to keep
mum. The evening's entertainment
brought a double surprise, when Pliny
Smith, with a few appropriate re
marks, in behalf of the people, pre
sented Mr. and Mrs. Hale with a beau
tiful set of dishes, to which the pastor
readily responded in his usual pleasant
way, while Mrs. Hale extended thanks.
Appropriate remarks were made by
Rev. F. E. Currier and Dr. L. W.
Burbank. Refreshments of cake and
coffee were served and a bride's cake
from Mrs. Jennie Rogers was presented
Mrs. Hale. Congratulations were ex
tended, all wishing to meet the worthy
couple at a similar gathering 15 years
hence.
