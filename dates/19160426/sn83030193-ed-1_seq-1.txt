While last reports placed the bandit

an equal share of the denunciation,

declared that Itogers and tho woman
were living like wild beasts, "that the
crime was premeditated, mid that she
should go to the electric chair."
Several times during his address
Mrs. Itogers broke down and wept.
Itogers tried to comfort her. It was
plain that he, ton, felt the forco of
the District Atlnnirj's words, for
when he was branded a "libertine"
hl.s face became crimson, he clenched
his lists and half rose from his chair.
The charge of Justice Tompkins to

Martial law has been proclaimed in lublin County and Dublin City

and public buildings. Liberty Hall, the headquarters ol the Sinn Fein
Society, a Separatist organization, is also in the hands of the troops.
Reports that the rebels were armed with machine guns were denied
by Premier Atiitli. He announced that the Nationalist IrMi V olunteers
who are loyal to John Redmond aided the Dublin authorities in putting
down the tint and that mail) citiens of Dublin also joined the troops
