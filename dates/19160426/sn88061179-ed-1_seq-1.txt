A Serious Mat?
ter.
?
It is estimated til tit during
?;tlu past decade more than fifty
thousand of our best southern
[farmers with their hoys and
girls have lefi Uie South to lo
;,Cate in tho UOWOr states of the
;;west uhd north-west. This
?trend of on,mi?rat ion is still
(lowing outward from our bor
ders into other sections and if
Ewe do not rally to the situation
'and endeavor to inaugurate
nonie of the ofTootivo methods
used by other sections to at?
tract our people nwuy from us,
I we are going to coiil Inno to suf
: for, while they prospci ;is a re
suit of our neglect;
You Can Help.
Almost every family in the
South has oim or more relatives
or acquaintances that have
gone into other states. If all
of us would write our State
Commissioners of Agriculture,
the Agricultural and Industrial
Agents of the railways serving
jour territory and the secro
tnrics of the Hoards of Trade in
nearby towns or cities, giving a
list of the names and addresses
of tllCRO people who have left
us, it would enable these sever
al agencies to get in touch with
them und send attractive litera?
ture portraying our own ad?
vantages, with the probability
that many of these peopl.in
f be interested in investigating
tho opportunities that have de?
veloped in tbe South within the
past ten years.
When this is done, we ant
going to be abb' to interest a
considerable number of them
in returning to the "old home?
land" and relocate among us
and help build up our country
and inert-use our prosperity.
Railroads Will Co-operate.
The railways of tho South are
spending hundreds <>f thousands
of dollars endeavoring lo gstou)
this tide of ommigration and to
increase the tide of immigra?
tion from other states. Wont
you help theui develop your
own community. You can do
this by sending names of peo^
pie whom you believe can be
ihteroHp'd in this section. If
you will address any of the fol?
lowing they will be glad to for?
ward literature and write the
people direct, without mention
ing your name if yon so desire

your town an,I surrounding ter

lots and forward to your friends
or give your Secretary a list of
the names and ask him to for.

A personal letter to them;
telling about the development
of our section and the oppor
?.unities it oilers, witli a heartj
invitation to come hack and

a great deal of gooti.
Let us work together witli
this end in view and see if we
can not bring about a larger iv

plo to come and make their
homes among us. We need
more people to cultivate our
idle aores and to holp us build
up our industries. With all
our people working together to?

Last Word Said
To Germany
And United States May Be?
come Embroiled in tiie
European War.
? President Wilson has issued
ah Ultimatum to Germany that
the United States will hreak <>IT
diplomatic relations it her ille?
gal submarine campaign is con
tinued. As a result the war
clouds are hovering over the
country, and the United States
may become involved in tho
Hluropenn wnr. The President's
note was split to ?ertnany on
last Tuesday; and <>n the an
swer depends whether the
friendly relations which hav
heretofore existed between these
countries is to ho severed.
The President told Congress,
in joint session, no Wednesday,
of his action and nave a resume
ot the many violations of inter
national law, by Germany, ill
her Buhiiiarinecampnigu, which
has resulted in the death of
many American citizens. The
crisis was brought about by the
policy inaugurated by Germany
in sinking merchant ships with?
out warning.
In his note to Germany, ttiii
i President said: '?The Govern?
ment "i the I nited States is a'
last forced to the conclusion
that there is hut one course it
can pursue; and that unless the
imperial German Government
should now immediately de
elare and effect an abandon
me lit of its present methods of
warfare ngiiinst passenger and
freight-carrying vessels, the
government can have no choice
hut to .-ever diplomatic relations
with the government "' ",e
German ICmpire altogether."
Base Ball Game
< )n account of the postpone?
ment ol the game between Ihg
Stoiie Gap and Cocburn, the
Appitluchiit high school loam
came down Saturday afternoon
anil engaged the local highs in
an exhibition game, which Whs
won by the home team, (he
coro being (i to 5
Although many errors wore
made by both sides, the game
wtis, nevertheless, interesting,
the score being very close
throughout the entire game. A
hard wind blew over the din
mood continually which made
fielding lliillctllt and accounted
for ninny of the errors. Iloih
I press und Dowell, opposing
pitchers, twirled n good game,
their work heilig the main fea
lures. CresH fanned sixteen of
tlio Gap hoy s and yielded live
hits, while Dowell funned seven
of the Appalachia boys' and al
lowed only two hits.
The same teams are scheduled
to play a postponed league
game here next Saturday ami it
will no doubt be a Contest
worth seeing.

Miles a Day.
Xew Tazowell, Toon., April
21.?Though HIT ye ns old, Uli
clo William (Maxtor,, of Clai
borns County, can walk ton
miles a day with little fatigue.
Ho lias never worn a coat ei
ther in summer or winter, and
during his eat ire life has nei?
ther called a physician nor tak?
en any medicine.
Uncle William resides with
his son, Albert Clnxton, who is

their home on Straight (.'reek,
about six miles west of New
Ta/.owoll.
The old man was born and
reared in Claihorne County,aud
has resided here throughout, his
life.
Though almost deaf, this ac?
tive centenarian thoroughly en
joys a conversation with any
of his various friends or ac?
quaintances when it is possible
for him to understand.
At present there are live gen?
erations of the fluxion family
who were born anil still reside

Buys Ham?
mond Torpedo
Device Controlled by Radio
Dynamic Forces Can Hit
Mark at Twenty
eight Miles.
For $750,000, a young Ainori
can inventor is about to surren?
der tu Uneb ftun nil the patents
ami the exclusive rights to use
a device hy whicli a torpedo
can lie launched against the
batlloship of an enemy and so
directed ami controlled by radio
dynntnio forces either from
shore or from mi aeroplane, as
to insure its striking its mark
at a maximum distance of
twenty.eight miles.
} John Hays Hammond, Jr., of
Gloucester, M ; .. , th" wizard
son of .lohn Hays Hammond,
the mining engineer, is the in?
ventor and owner of 128 patents
which will In- turned over to
i he i;ovei innent:
Although 6hl> years old,
young Hammond h is accomp?
lished what many of tin. mili?
tary scientists of other conn,
tries have tried to pur foci and
liailed.
Discovery that the govern
moot is willing to pay young
Hammond a fortune for his
jnveution was made with the
introduction in tie' liouse of the
fortifications;bit), l ie sum of
?750,1100 was approved as a fail
price, both by military Officials i
ami the sub-committee.
There is the authoritative
statement thai Hammond refus?
ed to sell his invention for a
fabulous sum to one of the
Khropchn countries' now at
war, explaining to the old
world bidders that in. amount
would tempt llilll to give them
t he preference over his native
land.
When it became known Ham?
mond Ililil expended Pi)00,000,
furnished by Ins father, in per
feeling bis ilevic ? and bad
labored continuously on it foi
night years, the sum he asked
io surrender all patent rights
whs considered reasonable.
Hammond's plan involves the
control of the torpedo from a
station, well protected, some
distance back from the sea.
The best method, he has found,
is to place I In- torpedo in the
prow of a boat, which can lie
propelled at a liiiv-miie rate,
making it impossible to hit.
Pho boat is controlled by the
radio forces and sent against a
battleship. When a short dis?
tance away from the target the)
tar'pedo is propelled from the
boat against the target.
Hut the FTaitiiihohd torpedo
maybe controlled with equal
ease from an aeroplane, from a
height of one mile.
By repeated experiments
Hammond has proven that by
an ordinary I.mil attack his tor
pudo can hit, teh out of fifteen
times, a bamboo reed one inch
in diameter standing upright at
a distance of three and one
half miles.
