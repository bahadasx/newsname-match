Operators and Miners Dead
locked Over Recognition of
United Mine Workers
176,000 MEN AFFECTED
Walk Out Verdict at Pottsville
May 2 Is Feared; "Check
off" Refused
By Associated Press
New York. April 26.—Deadlocked
over the question of recognition of the
United Mine Workers of America, the
anthracite operators and miners to
day face the possibility of a strike in
volving 176,000 men. The three ex
ecutive hoards of the mine workers'
utilon meet here to-day to receive the
report of the subcommittee, which was
unable to reach an agreement with
the operators' subcommittee. Both
subcommittees will report to a general
conference of both the miners and
operators that they have been unable
to reach an agreement after seven
weeks of discussion.
Unless this conference is able to find
a way to break the deadlock, it will be
left to the miners' convention at Potts
ville. Pa.. May 2. to determine whether
the miners shall declare a strike. Rep
resentatives of the miners to-day ex
pressed faint hope that further nego
tiations would be productive of results
and said that not one of the demands
made by the miners has been granted
by the operators.
Refuse "Check Off"
The deadlock is attributed by the
operators to the miners' demand for
full recognition of the union, a closed
shop and 'he compulsory collection by
the operators of all dues and assess
ments of the United Mine Workers
laid upon their members. Tlie op
refused this demand, known as
" eck off." on the ground that
t-American and against the
of every other labor organ
;n the country.
Demands and Answers
The other demands of the miners
and the answers given by the op
erators were outlined here to-day as
follows:
A two-year agreement. Ananswered.
Twenty per cent, increase In wages.
Five per cent, offered.
An eight-hour day. Granted, pro
vided production is not curtailed.
Simpler methods of settling griev
ances. Operators willing to adopt any
plan to speed the work of the con
ciliation board.
Limit contract miners to one work
ing place. Refused.
Equitable and uniform price of sup
plies to miners. Operators willing to
consider at any time.
"•Mine run" basis of pay for piece
work. Refused.
Readjustment of machine mining
scales. Operators offered minimum
rates of $2 to 52.55 a day.
Arrangement of detail wage scales
and settlement of internal questions by
districts. Refused.
To prohibit individual contracts in
mining- Refused.
The operators in refusing to install
the "check off" system assert that they
are in accord with the decision of the
anthracite strike commission appointed
In 1902. John P. White, president of
the United Mine "Workers, denies that
the strike commission settled this ques
tion, but says the commission took up
that subject on its own initiative and
contrary to an agreement under which
the demands of the miners were sub
mitted.

Faculty Members
The subject of "Preparedness" in its
largest sense was the subject of an
address delivered to the students of
the Technical high school this morn
ing at the opening exercises by Dr.
Henry S. Drinker, president of Lehigh
University. "I believe in the theory
of a sound mind in a sound body,"
said he. "If America ever has to go
to war, 99 out of 100 of our young
men will go, and we want them to be
prepared to render a patriotic service
to their country," he added.
Dr. Drinker is chairman of the gov
erning committee of the summer mili
tary camps and stopped off in this
city for the express purpose of speak
ing to the Tech boys. The speaker
urged the students to think of pre
paring for some college. He stated
that life is strenuous, and that the
college bred man has better chances of
success than the fellow without that
training. Dr. Drinker explained the
purposes of the several military camps
in various parts of the United States
and asked the Tech boys to investigate
the value that might be derived from
a six weeks' course in one of these
camps.
Accompanying Dr. Drinker was Pro
fessor Raymond Walters, registrar of
the Lehigh University. He told of
the good work that is being done by
the Tech graduates that are attending
the South Bethlehem institution, and
stated that many of the Harrisburg
lads are the I'eal leaders in the uni
