Germany is inevitable.
The German newspapers are
now taking a more serious view
of the German-American situa

to the Berlin general headquar

optimistic nor pessimistic, but
show full realization of the
gravity of the crisis.

Lansing Deprecates Reports
Washington, I). C, April 26. At a
conference with newspaper reporters
yesterday afternoon, Secretary Lan
sing deprecated the reports that of
ficial dispatches from Ambassador
Gerard indicated that Germany might
make concessions to the United States
in reply to the Wilson note demanding
immediate abandonment of her pres
ent methods of conducting submarine
warfare. It is felt here that these
stories indicating that Germany might
make certain concessions would have
a bad effect upon the German peo
ple. Cables Suggestion to Berlin'.
Washington, April 26. German Am
bassador Bernstorff, in response to
a request from the Berlin government
has cabled suggestions for a course
in the submarine crisis which he
believes will avert a break with the j

fore acting.
No Answer Before Saturday.
Berlin, April 26.--The German an
swer to the American note may not
be expected before the week end. It
will likely be presented Saturday.

Ardmore Owners of Zinc Lands to

C. L, Byrne, C. L. Anderson and
W. B. Johnson, who own 160 acres in

district of the Ozark mountains in
Arkansas, have sent men upon their
holdings with the proper kind of
drilling machinery to test the land
for zinc. Big paying mines are on
every side of the property and ev
ery prospect is that the farm they
own is rich in mineral. If the tost

EVANGELIST WILLIAMS IN HIS
SERMON LAST NIGHT PICTURED
GREATNESS OF GOD IN HIS
CREATION.
La.st night, although it rained, a
fair-sized congregation listened to
Dr. M. B. Williams deliver perhaps
his best sermon so far during the
union revival being conducted in the
big tabernacle. Dr. Williams has no
rainy day sermons but believes in
giving Ills best to those who brave
the elements to hear him preach
The evangelist was in a happy but
thoughtful mood, and for fifty-five
minutes a continuous rain of words
and sentences fell from his lips, while
his congregation sat motionless and
enraptured at his magic thoughts.
His subject was: "Man." He used for
his text Psalms 8:4. "What is man,
that thou art mindful of him?" Ho
said in part as follows
"I believe one reason men do not
serve God more is because they don't
know how vast and great He is. To
a great many people, those that serve
the ilesh, God is merely an abstrac
tion, a figure of speech. So many
say, 'I am so busily engaged at, my
work, making a living for myself and
family, that I haven't time to think
of tne one you call God.' This class
of persons and these opinions are
the greatest opposing forces to Chris
tianity that we have to deal with.
Therefore, it is up to us to intro
duce God to such people and to cause
them to become thoroughly acquaint
ed with Him.
"I want you to go with me tonight
on a trip for the purpose of making
a study of some of the wonderful
things of God. Let's observe some
of the works that He has wrought."
Here the speaker took his congrega
tion on an Imaginary trip to the
heavens. In passing, the moon is
observed as a great ball of fire, about
which there is much speculation as to
its origin. It is noticed that the
moon is uninhabited and is barren of
vegetation. However, God made it
and no doubt for some-purpose. The
different planets were observed in
passing, and especially the planet
Mars. Scientists have discovered that
it is inhabited. That it is a world of
land and seas, mountains and plains.
By the use of the powerful telescope
man on the earth can see when the
seasons change on Mars, also that
great artificial waterways, such as
canals, have been constructed, and j
in many instances have been changed I
from time to time. It is also ob
served that God is still building
worlds, that the telescope tells us
that the planet Jupiter is still in
process of creation. The speaker's
word-voyage was intensely interest
ing and instructive in names and !
cations of planets and the distances
from each other and from the earth.
"So we see that there are other in
habited worlds, the same as ours.
Some people think that after a while,
when we leave this world, we'll have
I nothing to do but to rest. I would
not be surprised, It when we leave

MEXICAN
GIRL CAUSE
OF CLASH AT
PARRAL
El Paso, Tex., April 2"i. Ameri
cans here from the Parral district
attribute the recent attack on Ameri
can soldiers at Parral to the desire
of a Mexican girl for revenge on
Mayor Jose de Luz Herrera.
The girl's brother was shot and
killed by the late Monclava Herrera,
son of Mayor Herrera, more than a
year ago. Since then she is said to
have nursed the idea of revenge
against the Herrera family. When
the American troops appeared in
Parral her chance came. She is said
to have appeared on the plaza and
to have Incited the Mexicans to make
the attack.
According to the story told here the
girl carried a rifle and herself fired
on the retreating khaki-clad troops.
The arrivals here say the girl is
now imprisoned.
Mayor Herrera, whose son, General
Luis Herrera, has arrived at Parral
from Chihuahua, with a detachment
of troops said to number 800 men, Is
making every effort to control the
Villista sympathizers here. Many ar
rests are reported to have been made.
