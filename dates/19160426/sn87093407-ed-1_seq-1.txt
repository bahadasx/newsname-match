AMERICANS TO
BE WARNED
OFF ARMED
SHIPS
WASHINGTON, April 26.—Warning u
to be issued to Americans to refrain from
traveling on certain armed ships as soon ai
the administration learns what vessels are
under mandatory orders from the allied gov
ernments, it was learned today.
WASHINGTON, April 26.—Belligerent* should
presume armed merchantmen to be peaceful unless then
is "conclusive evidenvce to the contrary."
This position has been taken by the United Stataf
government, it was officially declared today by the
state department
Merely because an enemy merchantman is armed*
there is not sufficient cause for a belligerent to declare
it a warship and attack it regardless of the rights of per
sons aboard.
These points were announced to the world in 4
memorandum intended to clear up the American pod*
tion on the subject of armed ships.
The memorandum t» aimed to
forestall Germany from asking the
Anerl<~mn position on the present
method of submarining.
In neutral water*, the meraoran
'dnm *ald. the etstus of an arroe<l
•hip would be decided from all the
circumstances of the case.
"A neutral government may pro
ceed upon the preemption that an
armed merchantman of belligerent
nationality I* armed for aggression,
while a belligerent should proceed
on the presumption that the vea
oel Is armed for protection," read*
the memorandum
The memorandum agrees with
the German position concerning
vessel* In the government service
Intended for hunting submarines
and warships, but disagrees wltn
Germany's contention of right to
sink an armed merchantman on the
assumption that It Is necessarily
armed for the offensive,
• By direction of the president,"
the statement resds, "a memoran
dum was prepared during March.
1916, In regard to the statue of
armed merchant vessels In neutral
ports and on the high seas. This
memorandum is now made public
as a statement of this govern
ment's attitude on that subject.
The memorandum declares that
anv enemy warship 'may properly
exercise force to compel surrender
If the armed merchantman fires
