Warrant Issued
For Arrest of
Mayor J. A. Best
COMPLAINT FILED CHARGES HIM
WITH VIOLATION OF VA
GRANCY LAW.
Mayor James A. Rest was this af
ternoon charged. In a complaint filed
in the Justice court, with a violation
of the state vagrancy law, and a war
rant was sworn out for his arrest. At
press time he had not been served
i w ith the warrant.
The complaining witness Is Ar
thus J. Gibson whom the mayor had
arrested Saturday night on a charge
of violating the dancing ordinance
and whose trial is set for Saturday.
The offense of which the mayor is ac
cused is alleged to have been com
mitted in the Oregon theater on the
night of March 23 at the conclusion
of the boxing exhibition between Ray
MrCarroll and Romeo Hagan. The
complaint charges that he conducted
himself in "a violent, riotous and dis
orderly manner" and used "abusive
and obscene language" In the pres
ence of a large assembly of people.
, The occasion is well remembered by
j the public as it excited a great deal
of comment at the time.
Just what counter Mayor Beet will
make Is a matter of conjecture. It
is said that he has been threatening
to prosecute the principals In the box
ing bout and it is known that today
he sought to secure an affidavit
from McCarroll to the effect that his
bout with Hagan was a "priie fight"
and not a "boxing bout,"'
