Catapulted from his y motorcycle

this morning Alvin Hooker, age 22, 73
Beardsley street, struck head foremost
against an iron gff der on the bridge
and. suffered a compound fracture of
the skull. He is in a dying condition
at St. Vincent's hospital.
The accident occurred Just east of
the power box on the draw. Hooker
was on his way to work at the Auto
matic Machine Co. on Bast Washing
ton avenue. As he neared the center
of the bridge he attempted to pass a
bicycle ridden by Edward Hayden of
85 Fifth street. In turning from be
hind Hayden's bicycle the motorcycle
collided with the rear of the wheel.
The cycle turned upside down while
Hooker was hurled through the air.
He struck head-on against a girder.
, Hayden was knocked from his bicy
cle but ' was uninjured except for a
few minor abrasions on his legs.
Hooker lay limp and helpless in the
roadway. He was picked up by Hay

SCHOOLHOUSES
OF BRIDGEPORT
FAR OVERTAXED
More Pupils on Half Time
Session Than Ever Before
In City History. ''
NEW BUILDINGS NOT
ENOUGH FORRELIEF
-.
r 5 ' .
Portable Buildings and
Short Periods Haven't
Solved Problem.
' More Pupils are attending half time
sessions of the public schools at pres
ent than ever in the history of the
city of Bridgeport and it is doubtful
if even the recent $300,000 bond issue
will be sufficient to build schools
enough to meet the situation.
At a special meeting of the board
of education, which will be held this
evening arrangements -wlll be made
for a school ifi Wayne street. T,he
committee on school houses, Elmer H.
Havens, William R. Webster, Jr., and
Nathaniel W. Bishop,., contemplate an
eight-room building withan assembly
hall. It may be that a 16-room, build
ing will be erected . instead. Eight
rooms may be added to Waltersville
school, four rooms and an assembly
hall to Garfield school, eight rooms
to the Normal school in Clinton ave
nue, ' four rooms and assembly hall
to the Hall school in Clermont ave
nue and a new school of eight rooms
at least is to be built somewhere' in
Myrtle avenue. , The board of educa
tion has adopted -uniform plans for
all schools. An eight-room addition
will be. made to MaplewoooL avenue
school on a site purchased directly
across., the street from the school
house ..there . . ,'
The totav registration of children
between 4 and ,16 years' of age, enu
merated to October 1, 1915, shows 29.,
949. Of these 19,950v are 'recorded
in the -public schools. . - Nearly 8,000
were .estimated in the parochial
schools and there are probably more
by this time as it is estimated triftt
the number of school children who
have- come to this city since the school
census was made is about 5,000. Thfe
parochial schools are maintained by
various parishes of . the" Roman Catho
lic" churches without expenses to the
city. They do not share in the,"pub
lic school funds.
Seven rooms are on half time at
Waltersville school, four, rooms at
Maplewood school, two rooms at Gar
field school andf" two rooms at Myrtle
avenue school. In all it is estimated
that .600 pupils can attend half time
sessions only. Although there have
been times within the last two jrears
when the number of pupils on half
time was a trifle' larger, yet there were
not so many schools at that time or
so many portable buildings in use.
At present , more "than 650 pupils
are taught in portable buildings of
which three are in use at the Normal
school in Clinton avenue, two at
Washington school, "one at Shelton,
oneat Lincoln,, one at McKihley, two
at Sheridan, one at Newfield, two at
Wheeler, one at Myrtle avenue, one at
Longfellow and one at Kossuth street
schools ' -; -. -
In addition to the new high school,
which was opened recently, there is
the old hrgh school' now being used
for the higher grades and teaching
domestic science. There are 30
grammar' schools.'. The teaching force
now numbers 503 in addition to Su
perintendent Samuel J. Slawson.
.It is estimated that another year
must elapse before the .additions con
templated can be made and the new
schools built. In the meantime the
price of all building materials is stead
ily rising. . Also the number of school
children for whom - educational facil
ities must be provided Is increasing,
due to the steady influx of working
people here. "'-;.'
Between April 1, 1915, and April 1,
1916, it is estimated that approximately
$60,000 was spent for new school
buildings now completed or unaer
course of construction, but as will be
seen by the figures above, . even this
vast sum was not sufficient to meet
the needs for educational ' fa41itles.
Most of the rooms that are oa half
time and the portaM- buildings in use
are occupied by children who are Just
beginning , their education.
