France Concurs in Long Note on
Commercial Aspects of
War.
EXPLAINS ACTS AS
MILITARY EXPEDIENCY
Welcome Combination of Neut­
rals to Prevent Violation of
Rights.
Washington, April 25.—The latest
British note in answer to the Ameri­
can protest against allied interfer­
ences with neutral trade made public
at the state department contends that
the practices complained of are "ju­
dicially sound and valid," and that
ihe relief which neutrals seek is
rather to be obtained by the mitiga­
tion of necessary hardships than by
"abrupt changes," either in the the­
ory or application of a policy based
upon admitted principles of interna­
tional law carefully adjusted to the
altered _conlitian^.ot.iMder« warfare..
Appoint Commission.
It discloses that "an impartial and
influential commission" has been ap­
pointed to find ways to minimize de­
lays and pledges the Allies to make
their restraints on trade as little bur­
densome to neutrals as possible.
The note in which the French gov­
ernment cbncurs, reiterates the mili­
tary necessity of regulating com­
merce to neutrals contiguous to Ger­
many and justifies the effectiveness
of the blockade which was challeng­
ed by the last American note.
More diplomatic correspondence
over the issue is expected to follow.
The unanimity of sentiment among
Ihe world's neutrals for the protec­
tion of neutral rights is recognized in
the British note, which refers to the
subject in terms not embracing the
rights of trade alone.
Sincere Satisfaction.
It says in conclusion:
'His .Majesty's government lias not­
ed with sincere satisfaction the inti­
mation contained in the concluding
passages of the United States note of
the intention of the United States to
undertake the task of championing
the integrity of neutral rights.
"The first act of this war was the
unprovoked invasion by the enemy
of neutral territory which he was
solemnly pledged by treaty to pro­
tect. The disregard of neu­
tral rights has since been extended
to naval warfare by the wanton de­
struction of neutral merchant ships
on the high seas, regardless of the
lives of those on board. His
Majesty's government would welcome
any combination of neutral nations
under the lead of the United States,
which would exert an effective influ­
ence to prevent, the violations of neu­
tral rights and they cannot believe
that they or their allies have much
to fear from any combination for the
protection of those rights which take
an impartial and comprehensive view
of the conduct of this war and judges
it by a reasonable interpretation of
the generally accepted provisions of
international law and by the rules
of humanity that have hitherto been
approved by the civilized world."
American Complaint.
At the outset the note suggests that
the American complaint is not so
much that shipments intercepted re­
ally were intended for use in the
European neutral countries to which
they were dispatched as that the dis­
patch of goods to Great Britain's ene­
mies had been frustrated by methods
not. hitherto employed by belliger­
ents.
"It would seem," says the note, "to
be a fair reply to such a contention
that new devices for dispatching
goods to the enemy must be met by
new methods of applying the funda­
mental and accepted principles to in­
tercept such trade."
Searches at Sea.
At some length the note argues the
impossibility of making searches at
sea, for various reasons, among which
are: Weather, the size of modern
steamships and the manner of con­
cealing the contrabands.
The note adds as a further reason
for bringing ships into harbor is the
necessity for close examination of all

Lansing Deprecates Reports That
Germany Is Ready to Make
Concession No Word Has
Been Received.
Washington, April 25.—Secretary
Lansing, in a conference today with
newspaper correspondents, deprecat­
ed the publication of reports that offi­
cial dispatches to the state depart­
ment from Ambassador Gerard, indi­
cated that Germany might make con­
cessions to the United States in reply
to the note demanding the immediate
abandonment of present methods of
conduct of submarine warfare.
He said official dispatches to the de­
partment from Berlin contained only
quotations of newspaper opinions
similar in many cases to the editorial
excerpts cabled from this country in
press dispatches.
it is felt here that stories indicat­
ing that Germany might make certain
concessions and that the German gov­
ernment was willing to go to great
length to preserve the friendly rela­
tions with the United States, might,
find their way back to Germany in
distorted form and have such effects
upon the German people as to make
more difficult the announcement of
any, policy of conciliation, .involving,
additional restrictions upon the use
of submarines. The internal political
situation in Germany has always been
extremely delicate when questions
concerning submarine policy were un­
der consideration.
OF
United States District Attorney
M. A. Hildreth to Conduct
Probe.
SANITARY CONDITIONS
TO RECEIVE ATTENTION
Fargo, April 2f.—Col. M. A. Hild­
reth, United States district, attorney,
will immediately start, an investiga­
tion into an alleged conspiracy to fix
prices of milk by the Fargo dairies,
and slates that should this be found
to be a case, the matter will be pre­
sented to the federal grand jury.
The attentoin of Col. Hildreth was
called to the fact that, the people of
Fargo are paying 10 cents a quart, for
milk, probably a greater price than is
paid in any of the larger cities, by a
prominent resident of the city, who
has been investigating the question
on his own account.
In a communication to Col. Hildreth
this citizen contends that a greater
price is charged in Fargo than else­
where, although a less price is paid
to the farmers for the product than
elsewhere, by those dairies that pur­
chase milk from the outside. The
writer quotes the prices paid and re­
ceived in other cities of the country
as follows:
Milk Prices Elsewhere.
City Paid per .Retail
1{M) /os. Price
Chicago $1.55 8 cents
St. Paul 1.68 7 cents
Minneapolis 1.28 7 cents
St. Louis 1.30 8 cents
Cincinnati 1.50 8 cents
Philadelphia 1.20 8 cents
New York 1.68 9 cents
Boston 2.16 9 cents
Col. Hildreth called attention to the
fact that in Chicago the dairymen are
being presented the grand jury in
ihe United States district court there
on charges of conspiracy to fix prices,
and the interstate commerce feature
of the Chicago conditions are being
investigated by the United States dis­
trict attorney, in those cases where
milk is shipped in from the outside.
Col. Hildreth stated thi? morning
that he would begin a thorough inves­
tigation of Fargo conditions at once
and if it is found that there are any
indications of a conspiracy to fix

neered a political coup whereby D.
H. iMcArthur of Bottineau and Dr. L.
S. Platou of Valley City consent to
withdraw from the gubernatorial
race. It is hoped that this will nar­
row the ultimate selection down eith­
er to Halvor Halvorson of Minot oi'
Michael Murphy of Grand Forks.
McArthur Rewarded.
Mr. McArthur is to be rewarded
with an appointment to the Minot
land office, for which position he has
been endorsed by the Ward county
democratic committee in a meeting
called hastily by, Postmaster Sten­
vick. Previously, Mr. Halvorson had
been endorsed, but that was before
he came out for governor.
Stenvick then went to Valley City
and secured the withdrawal of Dr.
Platou. Just what the Valley City
physician is to get does not appear.
This coup caused a sensation in
democratic circles. That it has been
engineered by United States Treasur­
er John Burke is generally believed.
McArthur was classed as a Burke
man and his candidacy has been giv­
ing the United States treasurer some
worry.
Promised Job.
McArthur was promised the Pem­
bina customs job, the most juicy
plum in the state, but was turned
down because some of his associates
opposed him and it. is understood tha'r
the United Stales treasurer refused
to O. K. him. Since then MoArthu'r
has been off the reservation and his
announcement for governor was a re­
sult.
As soon as the withdrawals hail
been arranged, Mr. Stenvick started
off for Washington to procure the
appointment of (McArthur.
The Burke faction is alarmed at
Ihe support accorded to Hellstrom
by the Equity and Non-panisan or­
ganizations. The former warden is
also credited with securing the elec­
tion of Perry. The fact, thai .Hell­
strom ran high man among the dele­
gates to the St. 1/Ouis convention has
alarmed his opponents.

from the interior. Hundreds of min­

other points, to Boob and Tolstoi
creeks in the Innoko district, where
the pay streaks have been found.
Three shafts yielding $2 to the cubic
foot were reported from Boob creek.
Virtually every dog in Fairbanks
has been engaged by the stampeding
miners, desirous of starting before
the break-up of the ice in the rivers.
Many other miners are building boats
and canoes to be ready to start as
soon as the ice goes out.

MAJOR GENERAL SCOTT
TO CONFER WITH HIM
No Developments in Mexican

Washington, April 2fi.—General Ob­
regon, minister of war of the 'Mexi­
can de facto government, is expected
lo arrive at Ihe border for his con­
ference with iMajor General Hugh L.
Scott, chief of staff of the American
army, by Thursday night at the lalt
est.
General Scott will be attended at
the conference by Major General
Funston, commanding the southern
department and in direct charge of
the border situation, and the pursuit
of Villa. It is understood General
Obregon will bring with him several
Carranza generals, personally famil­
iar with the situation in northern
iMexico and with steps that have
been taken by their forces to capture
Villa.
There were no developments here
today, either in the military or dip­
lomatic aspects of the Mexican situ­
ation. Advices Lo both the state and
war departments were meagre. Gen­
eral Funston forwarded delayed mep
sagfts, telling of the killing of a
trooper of the Tenth Cavalry by a
sniper, nearly two weeks ago, but
giving no details.
Money Depreciates.
The state department had reports
of continued quiet in various parts
of Mexico and also messages indicat­
ing that the presence of the Ameri­
can troops beyond the border might
be influencing the price of Carranza
currency adversely. Officials thought,
it possible this was one of the rea­
sons that impelled Carranza to urge
withdrawal of the American forces.
Last, quotations fixed the price of
Carranza money at 1 1-2c on the dol­
lar.
It was announced officially today
that the forces in Mexico and on the
border now wen1 amply provisioned
with slocks on hand large enough to
carry them up lo May 1", at least.
There will lie no further develop­
ments in llio situation until after the
conference between 'Generals Scott
and Obregon, unless the troops are
forced to take some action because
of attacks on I hem. The whole mat­
ter of Ihe pursuit, of Villa, or with­
drawal of Hie American troops is at
a complete standstill temporarily.
There is much speculation as to
just what will be discussed at the
conference. It is generally regarded
as more than likely that General
Scott will urge increased co-opera­
tion by Carranza troops in Ihe stamp­
ing out of brigandage along the bor-

CROP DELAY
01 STATE
Cold Weather Is Proving Serious
Handicap to Farm Oper­
ations.
The weather over the state was
generally cold, cloudy and wet, caus­
ing delay to spring seeding. Especial­
ly was this true thorughout the west­
ern and central portions. Owing to
the wetness of the soil daring the fall
months of 1915, not much fall plow­
ing was done, and as a result there
will be a large acreage of disced
grain this year.
The delay in spring seeding will
also have a tendency to decrease the
corn acreage. The temperature for
the week averaged about two degrees
below the normal. There was decid­
edly more than the normal precipita­
tion. The following are the weekly
amounts recorded at the various corn
and wheat region reporting stations:

BRITISH HOLDING
IN MESOPOTAMIA
London, April L'T).—Around Hill No.
.':i)4 and in the region of Esnes and
Cumieres, northwest of Verdun, the
bombardments continue to be intense.
To the east of Verdun around Mou
lainville, there also has been a violent
bombardment. In the Argonne the
French have destroyed with their
guns a Herman post., and shattered a
(Ierman trench over a small fronl.
Considerable aerial activity by the
French airmen, in which lour Herman
machines were brought down, is re­
ported by Paris.
On tin- eastern front near Garbun
ovka, the Russians made a heavy at­
tack against the Germans, but accord­
ing to Berlin, were repulsed with san­
guinary losses. Heavy artillery en­
gagements are still in progress on the
upper Cordevole and Monte San Mich
ele zones of the Austrian-Italian
fronts.
The British official communication
from Mesopotamia says the British
are still holding their lines on the
right bank of the Tigris against the
Turks, and have somewhat extended
them at some points by driving in the
Turkish pickets.
At La Chapelotte, in Lorain, the
Germans launched a heavy infantry
attack against he French, which was
repulsed. Some of the Germans ob­
tained a footing in a portion of the
French salient, but later were driven
out with heavy losses.
More Russians Arrive.
Marseilles was again the center of
tremendous enthusiasm today, as an­
other contingent' of Russian troops
arrived unexpectedly. The word
spread that the Russians were com­
ing soon, and crowds gathered at the
quay to witness their landing.
A regiment was drawn up along the
quay as a guard of honor, the French
band playing the Russian national
hymn, to which the Russian band re­
sponded with the "Marseillaise."
After an exchange between the
French and Russian officers, the land­
ing of the troops began amid continu­
ous hurrahs of the crowds, which lat­
er were swelled by a large number of
workmen from the surrounding fac­
tories and docks. The new troops are
composed of young men of excellent
appearance and sturdy bearings.
