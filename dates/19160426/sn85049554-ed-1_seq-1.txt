Washington, April 26.—Friends of an

in the Chamberlain' bill, which passed
the senate, failed yesterday in the
house to get a -direct vote on any of its
important provisions. Under a special
rule the bill was sent to conference by

senate.
The Chamberlain bill proyldes for a
standing army of 250,000 and a volun

country in a short time a trained army
of 1,000,000 men. The Hay bill in

Washington, /April 26.—Count
von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, in response to a request
from the Berlin foreign office, has
cabled suggestions for a course in
the submarine crisis which he be
lieves will avert a break with the
United States.
The Berlin foreign office's re
quest contains the statement that
Germany was prepared to go to
great lengths to prevent a rupture.
Washington, April 26.—A statement
defining the attitude of the United
States toward armed merchant ships
was made public today by the state
department by direction of President
Wilson. It originally was prepared as
a circular note to other powers, but
It later was decided to issue lit as a
statement
The statement holds to the right of
a merchant ship to arm for protec

men which have used their armaments
for aggressive purposes are not en
titled to the same hospitality in neutral
ports as peaceable armed merchant
men."

Gerard Explains Demands.
Mr. Gerard, under the instructions
he has received, made it clear that
his government has no intention to
demand that there should be a ces
sation of warfare against merchant
men merely asking that In all at
tacks upon merchantmen the principles
of -humanity and international law

The chancellor, is known, quoted
the assurances hitherto given, as es

London, AVrll 26.—The following

from Biron Wimborne, lord lieutenant
for Ireland, dated Dublin:
"The situation is satisfactory.
-Stephen's Green has been occupied.
^Eleven Insurgents ha.ve been killed.
The provincial news is reassuring."
Liberty Hall, headquarters of the

Martial law has been proclaimed in

Premier Asquith told the house of

being taken.
Outside of Dublin, he said, the coun
try was tranquil. The premier added
that,steps jvere being taken to ac

Steps to arrest all those concerned in
the movement, Mr. Asquith said, were
being taken.
At the opening of the house of com

that he was going there if he could

Ulster jUeader Dissatisfied.
The government's scheme to give the
voluntary system another trial as ex*
plained in the secret session of par
liament yesterday has not met with
the approval of Sir Edward Carson,
leader of the Ulster unionists, and his
oonscrlptionlsts supporters.
Sir Edward again has given notice
of his intention to move a resolution
demanding "equal'sacrifice from all
men of military age."
To Try Caaement For Treason.
The fact that Sir Roger Casement,
who was captured while attempting to
land arm from Germany on the Irish
coast, has been brought to England to
stand trial and is detained in military
custody, leads to tho assumption
that he will be tried on the charge of
high treason. This charge has been
preferred less than half a dozen times
in England In the last hundred years.
The last instance was during the Boer
war, resulting In the conviction of Ar
thur Lynch in 1908.
Lyr.cH, who is now a member of the
house of common!, was sentenced to
death, but the sentence was commuted
and a year later a pardon waa granted.
The Express suggests the possibility
that Sir Roger, If convicted of high
treason, way 'be beheaded, as- under
the existing law a person found guilty
of this offense may, by crown warrant,
be given the penalty of beheading in

miners had been favorably received by
the operators.
While official statements were lack
ing as to the details of the counter pro
posal submitted by the operators, be
cause of a decision by the joint sub
committee not to divulsro flu-in. it was
admitted thAt the operators refused to

sider more than a 5 ,per cent increase
in wages.
The general board of the miners
convened here today to receive the re
port of the sub-committee, after which

the anthracite field, and of these 125,
000 are said to be members of the
union.
