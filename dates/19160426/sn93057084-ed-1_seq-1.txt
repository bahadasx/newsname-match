BIG VOTE rOR NO IJCLNSt
The Aberdeen Amerieiin of
Tlr.ii'sidMy last irives tin following
summary of the result of the vote
hist week on tl
1
after ,1 uly I
lirenre ]iiest ion.
"With Faith, Isub.-l and other im­
portant, Milwaukee towns in the
southern part, of tin: state dry,
it looks as if the Milwauki
was irL'ttin^r uiiaiwiiiou., for no-
liee use
".Java. Bowdle find
Mol)rid_r«
arc the only wet towns on the main
lino of the Milwaukee road between
the Missouri river and the state
line as the result of the eleetion
held Tuesday, and these three
towns are the only wet towns in
this immediate! vicinity, with the
exception of Stratford, which re­
claimed is operating illegally at.
this time, and which will be dry
"At Waubay, the last thirst-
quenching' station on the line east,
of here, a most strenotis campaign
was waged, the wets receiving
their death blow in the recent
statement from Agent Mossman of
the SisscLon-Wahpeton Indian res­
ervation that unless the saloon
keepers refused to sell liquor to
his Indians he would remove all
the reservation business from that
town.'"
"The business men got busy on
the proposition, with the result
thai the town went dry by a ma
jority of
'Ik
votes, the vote stand­
ing loL' to H'S.
"It might further be added that
there is no wet. town on the Mil­
waukee main line between .Java
ami Minneapolis, all towns in
Minnesota being dry likewise
"Following f.iiit on Aberdeen,
many other towns in this immed
iate vicinity entered the dry column
among them being Eureka,llosiner
K'jseoa and Sclby, in addition to
Waubay
"James goes dry July 1, leaving
Java as the nearest port of entry
to the city, and that town is 7"
miles west of here."
The Water*own Public Opinion
has the following to say
"The returns of the Pierre'elec
lion show the city went dry by
87 majority and Ft. Pierre by oo.
other returns sent in here from
oyer the State, indicate that fifty
county seats of the slate out of
sixty three in South Dakota arc
dry, which gives the dry forces
great eneourgement that this gen
eral result over the state means
prohibit ion at the fall election."..
The warning against prairie
(ires cannot be repeated too often.
PoUer County needs the warning
just, as bad as our neiirhboriuir
counties even tho we have nol had
any great damage done lately. The
warning is especially applicable to
newcomers, who have not had any
experience with prairie files. The
last issue of the Pierre Capital
Journal tells how near some peo
pie come to being burnt out, in
the following extracts:
"Last fall this paper repeatedly
called attention to the necessity for
the need of fire breaks, but little
attention was paid to it or to the
many other warnings. A few days
ago a lot of damage was done by a
fire north of town and today an
other one is raging in the vicinity
of Spring Creek which is on the
county line between this and Sully
counties. Mrs. Core phoned in
jnst before noon that a big fire
was started and making for their
place, lt was reported that Mr.
Core was in town at that time.
Help was asked for to fight the
blaze.
