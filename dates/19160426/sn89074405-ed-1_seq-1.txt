MdSKIN, WRITTEN
The s^|eme court of North Dakota today dissolved
the injuncildft," made permanent in December by Judge
Pollock
restraining the Grand Forks board of
cdueatidn f^o^n erecting anew high school building.
The decision, which declares that the transfer of mon
ey from th$|eachers' to the general fund is not illegal, was
written by Justice Burke, and all justices concurred.
The syllabus of the court follows:
"An acfrpn to restrain the school board of Grand
Forks independent school district from carrying out a con
tract for the erection of a high school building, because cer
tain funds Had been diverted from the purpose for which
they had befcrf levied and that without such funds, said con
tract creates 3 debt in excess of the constitutional limit.
"Held, that the transfer of funds from the teachers' to
the general ftipd in this case is not prohibited by section
175, of the constitution, North Dakota."
Decision by Burke* J., all justices concurring.
Justice ,B^irko's decision, in part, follows:
"Not wilyrthe authority but the dictates of common sense impel us
to hold, aa wet do, that, Incidental balances levied in oood faith and for
the same .:genpral purpose, wheti tlie original purpose has been served,
they- cqn be tr|nfferrod from one minor account to another without
vlala(liu iqtte«pon 175 of our oonstltutlon. For instance, if a certain
sohettl boerd made a Ibvy of $1,000 for repairs for a current year and
thereafter a..4|fc occurred, doing damage to the amount or $2,000,
would it be contended that the school building must remain unre
paired for wither year uutll $1.0Q0in addition could be levied and
raised. whUp there was $1,000 surplus In the sinking fund aocmulated
In good Mm and not needled for that tmrpose. Furthermore, if the
strict ewwyfldii demanded by plalntllfs were allowed It would prevent
the Mtthsfeif of 'monejrlevied to pay the teachers In 1014 to a fund to
pay the ienri Widiero In 1018.,
»It mailt be kept in mind'also that this Is not. an action through
a detrtlne fpT leyy of a tax nor to prevent Its collection, but Is an ac
tion lojismwi. (lie fulfillment of a contract made by the board for the
crecdoa of ij sdhool Mflldiiig.
^Seahm lM of the constitution, which, by the way, Is not found in ...
all the-stiMmT^vliia,a gy!ttah Hlniiar to Kctlon. 176: reads:

nose' dhall not be diverted to any other purpose except by authority of
law.'
*'If this section applies to school corporation, and we beHetei it doee,
it^ and not section 17ft governs this case.
"It la our conclusion, therefore, that section 175 of the constitu
tion does not apply to cases like the first. Therefore, a court of
eanity ought not and will not in this case interfere. The Judgment of
the tnal court It reversed."
HISTORY OF THK CA8R
The-case had Its origin a year ago when the school board passed
a resolution providing for the erection of a new high school building.
A number of citizens protested against this action on the grounds
that the site was unwisely selected, the cost of the building too great
and the school board not in a position financially to incur such ex
pense.
The board, however, proceeded to award contracts for the erec
tion of'the building. Its action being upheld by a majority of the voters
Of the city at a special election held for that purpose.
WJtJfCTIOX ISSUED.
lite citizens of Grand Forks wly objected to the erection of the
building-at that time started court proceedings to stop the erection of
the building and on Aug. 7, 1B15. a temporary restraining order was is
sued by Judge C. A. Pollock sitting for Judge C. M. Cooley, enjoining
the erection of the building.
The school board, the Gray Construction company of Watertown,
S. D., and the Healey Plumbing and Heating company of St. Paul were
named in the decision handed down.
In ah order issued December 1 Judge Pollock made the temporary
injunction permanent, holding that the transfer of moneys by the
board ftom one fund to another was Illegal.
APPEAL SUSTAINED.
The school board appealed the case and the appeal was argued
before the supreme oourt at Bismarck three weeks ago. The appeal
has now been decided In favor of the board.
George A. Bangs and George RObbins of (Us city represented the
proteMing citizens daring the lttigatiOn The school board was rep
resented at various times by Scott Rex, O. B. Burmese, Ii. E. Birdzell
and W'.-E. Powler.

Seeding was commenced in Grand

Thomas -O'Connor of this city began
the sowing of wheat on his farm near
Thompson, N.. D.
Considerable work has already been
done In the fields in the county. J.
W. Scott of Gllby, one of the promi
nent county farmers, began work in
the fields last Monday, but was forc
ed to stop yesterday on account of
wet weather. Charles Dickson, also
of that town, has begun his seeding.
Most of the plowing in this county
was completed last fall, despite the
fact that much of the threshing was
finished late. Many of the farmers
now are completing the work of pre
paring the soil, while a few are al
ready seeding their grain.
Although the season for spring
work has been exceptionally late in
North Dakota this year, local realty
dealers declare the same condition
exists to an even more marked degree
in the central and eastern states.
All of the farmers have had every
thing In readiness for spring work for
several days, and It Is expected that
the seeding will be rushed to an early
completion.
