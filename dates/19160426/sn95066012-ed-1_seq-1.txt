' Show Victories In Others.
Boston, April 26. The unpledged

tial primary In Massachusetts yester
day swept', the Btate.- What Roosevelt
delegates wero elected Tvere. In isolat
ed districts, it appeared front the re
turns available early this morning.
and there are probably very few of
them. The unpledged slate, won by
'about 10,000. -
All of the unpledged "big four" were
chosen by a liberal margin, George
McCall, former Gov. Crane, Senator
Lodge and Senator Weeks all winning
over the Rooseveltlans, Bird, Gushing,
Gardner and Washburn, In the propor
tion of about four to three, according
to incomplete returns.
Gov. McCall, in spite of ante-primary
fears, led his ticket if early in
dications prove true, and Senator
Weeks brought up the rear. But the
senator had an ample margin over
Charles Sumner Bird, who had the
highest vote of the Roosevelt men.
There were contests in 11 districts
among the democrats, but these were
all personal, all the candidates being
understood to favor the renomination
of President Wilson.
. At 12.30 o'clock this morning it was
apparent that the unpledged district
delegates had won in the 1st, 2d, 6th,
7th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 15th districts.
There was still doubt about the 3d dis
trict, which Includes Fitchburg, the
4th which includes Worcester, the 8th
which Includes Cambridge and also
about the 13th, 14th and ICth. The
Roosevelt delegation was victorious in
the 9th'ttitricr.
Charles S. Baxter, manager of the
McCall-Weeks campaign, said that he
thought that the unpledged district
delegates had won In every district
but the 9th. Mr. Baxter estimated the
plurality of the McCall-Weeks ticket
of delegates-at-large at 10,000 for the
entire state.

Operators Balk at Recognition of
Union
MEN INSIST ON "CLOSED SHOP"
Offer of 5 Per Cent Increase in Wages
to Contract Workers and Eight-
Hour Day Rejected.
New York, April 2G.A great coal
strike involving more than 170,000
miners may sweep the anthracite reg
ion within three weeks. Negotiations
between sub-committees of miners
and operators broke down finally yes
terday on the demand of the miners
for a complete recognition of their
union, with a "closed shop" and a
"check oli."
Following a conference in the Union
League Club which lasted four hours,
both sides decided they could not
agree. Although the operators were
willing to yield some ground In the
matter of hours and wages, they un
compromisingly rejected the demands
of the mine workers considered of su
preme importance to their organiza
tion.
The concessions which the operators
offered included a 5 per cent increase
in the wages of contract miners and
the reduction of the working day for
the others from nine to eight hours
with nine hours' pay. The operators
said the eight-hour day with nine
hours' pay would be equivalent to an
increase of 12 1-2 per cent. No con
cessions would satisfy the miners so
as the operators would not grant the
demand that none but union men be
employed and the arrangement where
by operators would collect from their
miners their dues as memhers of the
United Mine Workers of America.

line. The parade was led by William
E. Hawks, mounted, followed by
Chief Brazil and officers of the lodges

esters in uniform, carrying axes. About
100 guests from other local orders
helped swell the size of the crowd that
welcomed Chief Hanger Duchancs and
suite from North Adams.
Returning to the hall, the band gave
a concert which was followed by speak
ing. Tho chief ranger delivered an ad
dress and Judge b. c. Bennett un
bosomed himself of appropriate re
marks. The dancing then began
which continued until midnight. The

County Improvement Association Of

Bennington co'unty is u beauty spot,
its scenery is unsurpassed, but there

clean up rubbish from yards, gardens,
barns, in most towns there exist a
few especially unsightly spots. The
people responsible for these will usual
ly fall Into line with a campaign and
will clean up. There are many public
dumps which should be abolished, in
many villages litter cans are needed.
The schools of Bennington county have
long been in line and are doing more
than ever this year. Development of
school and home gardens and the set
ting out of trees should play a part.
Prizes for the best photographs.

best sets of photographs, showing con
ditions betore and after cleaning up.

Joint Note Intimates That No
Abrupt Changes in Policy Will
Be Made.
Washington, April 25. The latest
British note in answer to American
protests against allied interference
with neutral trade, made public to
night at the State Department, con
tends that the practices complained of
are "juridically sound and valid" and
that the relief which neutrals seek is
rather to be obtained by the mitiga
tion of necesary hardships than by
"abrupt changes either in the theory
or application of a policy based upon
admitted principles of Internationa
law carefully adjusted to the altered
conditions of modern warfare."
It discloses that "an Impartial and
influential' commission" has been ap
pointed to find was to minimize de
lays, and pledges the Allies to make
their restraints on trade as little bur
densome to neutrals as possible. i The
note,' in which the French Govern
mont concurs, reiterates the military
necessity of regulating commerce to
neutrals contiguous to Germany, and
justifies the effectiveness of the
blockade which was challenegd by the
last American note. Moro diplomatic
corresi ondence over the issue is cx

G. M. HAWKS LOSES HORSE
Animal Became Frightened by Red
Fire and Burst Blood Vessel.
A saddle-horse belonging to Georgo

in a few moments.
The animal was ridden by Frank
Brooks and had been loaned to him

PUBLIC WEllFARE ASSOCIATION
Will
Co-operate But Not Join
With Y. M. C. A.
Editor of the Banner: The Public
Welfare Association desires to correct
several statements appearing in the
article headed "Y. M. C. A. join hands
with Welfare Association" printed In
Monday's Banner, and to correct the
false impressions which the article
must necessarily have created.
These misstatements are doubly un
fortunate because in correcting them
there is danger of giving the false Im
pression that the Welfare Association
is antagonistic to the Y. M. . A.
whereas it is its aim to eo-operate on
broad lines with all organizations
which exist for the good of the com
munity. But the Y. M. C. A. and tho
Welfare Association have not "joined
hand." The Welfare Association has
employed Mr. Mann as physical direc
tor for the boys at the playground to
serve three months. The Welfare As
sociation lias no part in what the Y.
M. C. A. plans to have Mr. Mann do af
ter his contract with them expires.
No plan or arrangement has been
made to transfer the playground work
to the Y, M. C. A. in September and
the statement in the Banner "when
fall comes arrangements will have
been made so that the work can be
transferred to the Y. M. C. A. gymnas
ium,", is not warranted by anything
that has happened. It is to be regret
ted that suggestions which were mere
ly discussed should have been pub
lished before either organization had
acted upon them. It would have left
the situation much clearer if the
plans, program and aspirations of the
Y. M. C. A. had not been stated in an
article dealing with the Welfare As
sociation. The aims and policies of
the Public Welfare Association are ex
pressed in the preamble to its constitu
tion which Is as follows:
Having at heart the common wel
fare, we, citizens and friends of Ben
nington, irrespective of racial, reljg
ious or political affiliations, associate
ourselves to promote such influences
and conduct such activities and pro
jects as shall make for the health,
happiness and prosperity of all the
people; to promote the efficiency of
existing aeencies, public and private,
to the same ends; to build up com
munity spirit, secure unity of action
and harmonious devotion to the com
mon good, without divisive rivalries,
duplication of agencies or waste of
energies; to make leisure hours con
struttive and recreation wholesome
especially for children and youths
and, in general to develop the initiative
and resources of the people..,, through
working and playing together, in real!
zation of an abounding and joyous life
as neighbors, friends and fellow -riti
zens in the village confraternity."

Bad Fire
Sunday
Stable
in Pittsfield
The exact toll of the fire at the Ham
ilton livery stable annex in Pittsfield
early Sunday, a. m. was two men and
17 horses. The damage will amount to
about $7000, mostly through loss of the

tho horses that lay dead on the tloor,
and as he flashed a pocket searchlight
ever the floor 'he saw the head of Mr.
Pennar close beside one of the dead
horses. After making sure thnt the
man was dead, he called to Mr. P.agg
who was nearer the entrance. As Mr

linht on (lie spot and noticed an arm
