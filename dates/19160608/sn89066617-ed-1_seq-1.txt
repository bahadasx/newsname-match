BUTLER COUNTY
TAX SUITS HERE
Carl C. Abbiogton Seeks To
Retrieve $3000 Collector's
Commissions.
FIGHT OUTGROWTH OF
TOWNSHIP ARGUMENT
Two Men Claimed Key To Cash
Drawer Supreme Court
Pickled Abbington.
The trial of a series of eight cases,
each growing out of township manipu
lations in Butler County in the last
four years, will be started this morn
ing in Common Pleas Court, when
Carl C. Abbington, County Collector
of Butler County, will seel: to retrieve
approximately $300 from township col
lectors who took in the money.
The history of the township manip
ulations traces itself back to the time
when Butler County adopted township
organization and then, on resubmis
sion, kicked it out. The wrangle over
tax commissions followed when two
sets of collectors were on the job.
The position of the township officers
was tested in the Supreme Court and
it was found that they were without
standing.
In November, 1912, at the general
election, Butler County adopted what
is known as the township organiza
tion. Accordingly, township collectors
to take in the taxes were elected and
they remained legally in office until
November, 1914, when the question of
township organization was again sub
mitted to the voters and it lost.
For several days after the election
the outcome thereof was unknown, and
in the meantime the township collec
tors continued to exercise the func
tions of their offices under the town
ship organization. f
-r'-ATseotr" as it "was determined that
the townsnip collectors had been done
away with, it became necessary to
have a county collector. There was no
difficulty about that, for almost over
night the county was furnished with
two collectors.
The county court declared the right
to appoint a collector under those cir
cumstances was vested in that tribunal
and proceeded to name Harry I. Dun
can of Poplar Bluff for the place.
However, Governor Major was con
vinced that he possessed the appoin
tive power and he named Carl C. Ab
bington of Poplar Bluff, a Democratic
lawyer and a brother of Edward L.
Abbington, well known Democratic
politician.
The two collectors Duncan and Ab
bington proceed to question each
other's rights to handle the county's
cash drawer and within a short time
were at logger-heads. Abbington ap
pealed to the Attorney General, who
instituted a quo warranto proceedings
in the Supreme Court, making all the
township collectors and Collector Dun
can parties thereto.
The Supreme Court held that the
voters had turned down the township
organization and likewise held that the
Governor of the State had the authori
ty to name the county collector.
Mr. Abbington forthwith filed his
bond as collector, which was on April
15, 1915.
During the litigation the "cream" of
the tax money had been paid into the
county treasury through the township
collectors. The month of December
following the election had been par
ticularly lucrative and the collectors'
commissions were substantial.
This thing had continued from No
vember, 1914 to April, 1915, when Mr.
Abbington filed his bond. The men
who held the purse strings and col
lected the collector's commissions and
who were made defendants in suits to
recover the commissions by Mr. Ab
bington, are as follows: J. R. Ratcliff,
Jay Reading, of Rombauer; J. H. Har
well, of Hendrickson; Henry Phillips,
of ronton; M. L. Deaton; Max Berger,
of Qulin; I. H. Barnhill and J. A.
Gardner.
The defense offered by the several,
township officers is that Mr. Abbing
ton did not become collector and was
not entitled to the commissions until
he had filed his bond.
The position as county collector will
be filled at the general election this
fall and John Harwell is a candidate
for the Republican nomination. Thus
far there are no Democratic aspirants
for the job, and it is said the county

salesman well known in this city, was
painfully injured Tuesday evening
when a 25-pound weight, used as a

BOY IS BLOWN INTO
FIELD YET UNHURT
Scott Couniy Youth Carried Sev
eral Hundred Yards By Cy
cloneHouse Destroyed.
New Hamburg, Mo., June 7. The
havoc of the terrible storm that cut a
narrow swath through portions of our
village Monday night is worse than
was first thought.
The residence and barn of Frank
Kern, a farmer near here, were not
only demolished but scattered over the
neighboring. farms for miles around..
Mr. and Mrs. Kern are a young
couple and have but one child. They
slept on the first floor. On the sec
ond floor slept John Schoen, 15 years
old, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew
Schoen of Benton, and a brother to
Mrs. Kern. Just what happened im
mediately after the storm struck the
house is not known, even by the occu
pants.
When they regained consciousness
they were widely separated in differ
ent parts of the field. Johnny Schoen
found himself several hundred yards
from where the house was. He was
wrapped up in a quilt, just as he had
slept. He was probably more scared
than injured.
Mr. and Mrs. Kern were brought
to consciousness by the rain pouring
on them. By calls they located each
other, and the baby was found by its
cries. As the house and ite contents
had been blown away and scattered
widely, the Kerns were left with only
their night clothes.
Dr. Schindler of New Hamburg was
summoned as soon as possible. He
found all suffering more or less from
bruises, but the Schoen boy was un
hurt. He was taken to his home in
Benton by Dr. Schindler. The fact
that the Schoen boy had been blown
the farthest and that he was still
wrapped up in a quilt and uninjured is
regarded as a miracle.
At the Leo Westrich place the house
and barn were also demolished. For
tunately no one occupied the house at
the time of the storm. A horse in the
barn was fatally injured.
The Philip Schitter residence was
only slightly damaged, the flues being
blown down.
The barn of Henry Brunke, near
Oran, was destroyed, and his orchard
greatly damaged.
Joseph Westrich's barn, about a mile
south of here, was blown down, and
its contents scattered over neighboring
farms.

Colonel Roosevelt Urged By Re

Present Plans.
SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE TRIBUNE
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 7. Announcement was made late tonight that
Col. Roosevelt would go to Chicago. He announced a few days ago that
he would not go to Chicago unless an unforeseen contingency arose. That
arose today in the form of urgent calls from both Progressives and Repub
licans, who urged him to go to Chicago. His leadership there, his close
friends say, will be the dominant factor -"n deciding whether there is to be
political peace or a third ticket.
Chicago, June 7. At the end of the first day's session of the Republican
and Progressive conventions the hope of harmony is being rapidly aban
doned. The Republicans have made up their minds to nominate Justice
Hughes, in the belief that his nomination will result in Roosevelt refusing
to accept the Bull Moose nomination.
On the other hand, the Progressives have decided to nominate Roosevelt
because they are confident that if he is nominated Hughes will not run on
the Republican ticket. At tomorrow's session Senator Borah will make an
attempt to extend the olive branch and ask for the appointment of a com
mittee of three to confer "with any prrrryM-wtth a view to uniting on candi
dates and the platform.
It was decided tonight that Senator
Fall of New Mexico will make the
speech nominating Roosevelt from the
floor of the Republican convention.
The balloting on a candidate for Presi
dent will begin Friday, but not more
than one vote will be taken on that
day, according to the present pros
pects. Notwithstanding the report that
Hughes will not accept the Republican
nomination if the Progressives nomi
nate Roosevelt, the Republicans are
going to make him their candidate.
Roosevelt's supporters tonight said he
would run as the Progressives' candi
date rather than support the man
whom he termed another Wilson.
A few words from Hughes would
make his nomination certain on the
first ballot. Unless effective opposi
tion comes, he will be chosen on the
third or fourth ballot anyway. An
announcement from Roosevelt that he
would support Hughes would cause a
stampede to the Justice.
The Republican leaders tonight are
willing to do anything but nominate
the Colonel, if he will only behave.
Tonight a radical preparedness plank,
intended to catch the Colonel, is under
discussion by the Resolutions Com
mittee. They are also considering a
suffrage plank, which is also intended
as bait for Mr. Roosevelt.
The keynote speech at the Republi
can convention today extinguished all
hope of stampeding the convention for
Harding. This oration tired the dele
gates and made the spectators weary.
One of the sensational statements
made tonight came from William
Loeb, former secretary to Roosevelt,
who stated that if the Colonel is nomi
nated by the Republicans, the Progres
sive party would disband. There is no
hope for the Colonel, according to
Senators Borah and Crane, who said
tonight that the nomination of Justice
Hughes is a certainty.
Frank H. Hitchcock, the undisputed
boss of the Hughes boosters, said to
night: "We shall have about 400 votes
for Hughes on the first ballot and will
probably be able to nominate him on
the second ballot. Justice Hughes will
be placed in nomination by Governor
Whitman of New York, and Senator
Fulton of Oregon will second it. We
shall make no attempt to force any
conditions as to the platform. We
want a platform acceptable to the
Progressives as well as the regular
Republicans, and we shall agree on
5E
any set of resolutions that are offered,
provided they do not violate none of
the recognized principles of the Re
publican party."
W. P. Jackson, National Republican
committeeman from Maryland, tonight
wired Roosevelt, begging him for the
sake of party harmony to come to
Chicago at once. He declared in his
message: "That the national interests
demand a complete reunion of th
Republican party, and I believe this
can he accomplished by a more perfect
understanding between you and the
Republican convention."
Mr. Harding said, in part:
"The country, wearied afresh by a
disappointing and distressing Demo
cratic administration, is calling for
Republican relief, and there is every
inspiration, every encouragement, and
every confidence that the light of Re
publican conscience, set aflame in this
convention, will illumine the way to
the country's restoration.
"We did not do very well in making
for harmony the last time we met.
The country has regretted; let us for
get and make amends to our country.
We did not divide over fundamental
principles, we did not disagree over a
national polity. We split over meth
ods of party procedure and preferred
personalities. Let us forget the dif
ferences, and find new inspiration and
new compensation in an united en
deavor to restore the country.
"The essential principles of Repub
licanism are unchanged and unchang
ing; the lofty intent, the indestruc
tible soul and the undying spirit of
Republicanism are as dominant today
years ago, or at any time during the
intervening years, and they are em
phasized today by the proof recorded
to Republican credit in the matchless
chapters of American progress. .
"N'o political party ever has builded
or ever can build permanently except
in conscientious devotion to abiding
principles.- Time never alters a fun
damental truth. Conditions do change,
popular interest is self-asserti ng, and
"paramounting" has its perils, as the
Democratic party will bear witness;
but the essentials of constructive govr.
ernment and attending progress are
abiding and unchanging. For examr
pie, we ought to be as genuinely.
American today as wben the founding,
fathers flung their immortal defiance'
in the face of old-world oppression.
