SOME BENEFITS OF
We must give a great deal of
credit to private initiative and en
terprise for the development of
natural resources that society may
be benefitted by the use of natural
pioducts. Public utility corpora
tions which develop natural re
souices and make them available
for oar social well-being, have pre
formed a great service in the .past
and they are continuing to serve.
The motive of p'ivate undertak
ings, be they by individuals or
corporations, is profit. The high
est public, good may not always be
accomplished by a public utility
privately owned and operated for
the reason that to do so would de
feat the object of the owner, pro
fit. -
Iu the development of commun
ity life in town or city the point is
reached when public interest be
comes paramount and the com
munity becomes restive under, the
restrictions of a pro-ht-making
utility and the demand becomes
insistent that public utilities shall
be municipalized publicly owned
and operated.
As a result of the demand for
111c 7 kshs unuvi 0111 p ui h'-1 KJil'
utilities, more than 300 waterworks
are owned by municipalities in the
United States while a large num
ber of other utilities: electric light
plants, gas plants ice plants etc.
1 unn i. t
iiavc isceij iao.cn uver iruui pixvaic
ownership or installed primarily
'by the municipality. '
In Kansas 90 per tent of the
water works are publicly ow ned ;
and the cities are rapidly gaining;
the others. Electric light plants
are now usually initiated by the
community. There is a growing
demand that restrictive legislation
feiall be removed that cities may
be enabled to initiate still other
utilities.
Practical Benefits of
Municipalization
The benefits to be derived 'from
the public ownership of public
utilities appear to even the most
casual observer. With public own
ership, a municipality, in the
words of Everett True, can have
what it wants when it wants it.
Service may be extended and im
proved at will. There may be a
bit of extravagance, if the com
munity desires Wa'er and light,
for instance, may be used to gain
the beautiful in flourishing parks
and white ways. The community,
be it city or town, ma' become
philanthropic and provide the poor
with conveniences and sanitation
without cost. It is, after all, fir
the public good, so why stint ser
vice. To gain these ends, with private
.interests owning public utilities,
means constant haggling over rates
andxexpenditures.
Whije it can not be safely prom
ised that municipal ownership will
lessen the cost of a utility, - it can
be safely asserted that the cost
need not be greater and seldom is.
Indeed, in many instances a sav
ing has been made by municipal
izing : a public utility. In many
cities the benefits of municipaliza
tion have-been realized and the
Utilities have been operated with
such success that a considerable
profit has been made and a balance
has been found in the . public
treasury to be used for the public
good. .
- HVilliam has reached the point
in her history when she has be
come j-estive under the iirivate
ownership of her water and light
lltilitip.a It ! vprv tiertinent (hut
her people ehould make a study of
the oubject of municipalization.
Next week the News will discuss
the feasibility of taking over these
utilities by uiunieipalizatio-i.

The News hesitates to praise
this program and its rendition as
fufly as it deserves. News readers
outside of Williams may not know
that we have had the most talent
ed corps of teachers in the country
and that they have had pupils of
unusual precocity to work with.
There is other evidence of such a
condition in our school, ibut the
entertainment would be sufficient. '

Band. The , fame of the Barnes
Boys Band is far from local. Both'
the band and the orchestra, which
Mr. Barnes led with masterly skill
and musical executior, have been
brought to a remarkable degree of
musical efficiency by their leader.
The choruses were given with

hearty applause. The dancing by
the girls was the feature of the en
tertainment and the dances were
wildly applauded. No. 3 was en
cored and brought an extra num
ber, The Hungarian Ritka. The
Irish iie was repeated in .response
to encores which would not be
otherwise silenced. The Russian'
Cossack dance was a beautiful
dance beautifully executed. Noth
ing but the lateness of the hour
prevented an insistent demand for
this feature of the entertainment,
was added after the program had
been formulated. The Oxen dance
was given bv the "Supai - sisters"
Walter Finney and Philip Chap
man. ' The measures of this
laughter producing ' performance
were carried out with epirit and
the house was convulsed.
The entertainment was closed by
appropriate remarks by W. M.
Hughes president of the school
J board, and a short farewell ad
dress by retiring Superintendent
E. V. Latham.
