The Senior class of the High school
is much the largest in the history of
the school and one of which any city
even much larger than Vale might be
Justly proud. The class consists ,of 24
members, six boys and eighteen girls.
Three of the boys live in the town and
three in the couutry, while eleven of
girls are home girls and seven from
outside districts. This is much the
best showing made by the school since
we have had so many foreign students.
We are wonderfully glad to see the
boys and girls from outside come to
Yale High school, but it is especially
gratifying to have 60 large a number
of our own boys and girls completing
the work of the high school

In former years two evenings during
the last week of school constituted the
commencement exercises and the first
with the orations and addresses given
by the graduates was called class day
while the second evening with an ad
dress or lecture by some noted speaker
was called commencement evening.
Then a new order of things was es
tablished and the graduates were called
upon to give so many rhetoricals dur
ing the school year which plan abolish
ed the one evening.
This year It was decided to give a
class day program in the high room
and last Friday evening was the time
et.
The complete tilling of the large
room Attested the interest felt in the
doings of the students of our school.
The program was carried out as pub

but not leastly the excellent "Valedic

panying portrait that the subject of
this sketch had passed the fifty mark ?
WILLIAM IL FLETCHER
Mr. Fletcher was born June 6th, 1865
and has had a most strenuous life ever
since. He spent his boyhood days on
a farm and in later years worked in
the lumber woods. Since locatlog in
Vale a number of years ago, he has
been engaged in buying hay and farm
produce, making a success, to a consid
erable extent, of this business. Besides
this occupation he gives his spare time
to the management of an 80-acrefarm
located south and east of this city. He
has a tjne home on east North street
and is surrounded by an affectionate
wife and two daughters who are all
taken up with hubby and dad.
Here's hoping that Will lives to the
ripe old age of his father, Chas. Fletch
er, who will have reached four score
years and eleven next Monday.
' Caledonian Day.
On Tuesday evening a few of the
businesH men of our city who have a
little (or a lot) of Scotch blood In their
veins got together and talked over
plans tor putting on a day of real
Caledonian sports in Yale some time
during the summer.
Many towns throughout the state
have a Caledonian Day each year, and
it certainly gets a crowd. All who
were present seemed very much in
favor of the proposition, and letters
have been written to different places
asking for information as to the esti
mated cost of a day's sports, and the
addresses of pipers and dancers for the
occasion.
As soon as these are heard from a
meeting will be called and a date set
This will be arranged so as not to con
tlict with either the big Fourth of July
celebration or the Chautauqua.
If this celebration is put through,
there will be all kinds of athletic games,
a fast base ball game, Scotch dancing
and pining, with good purses hung up
for each event. In all probability
the day would wind up with a big
Scotch entertainment in Central ball
in the evening.
