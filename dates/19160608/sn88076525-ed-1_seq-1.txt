Suggestion From Philadelphia.
Governor Burnquist today received a
letter from Samuel H. Barker, financial
editor of) the Philadelphia North Ameri

memory.

The letter follows:
"Allow a suggestion, very earnestly
made, even if it comes from one so far
oft as Philadelphia, James J. Hill is
dead. I submit that St'. Paul, his home
city, and Minnesota, the great state
which he did so much to develop, would
lionor themselves by erecting a heroic
statue to this man whose life work,
marks him for time to come as a com
manding figure. Such statue should be
fittingly placed, if possible, in a park
-dedicated to the public good, and at all
events where present and future gener
ations will see and draw inspiration for
work, yet to be done by having im
pressed upon their minds and imagina
tion the deeds and high worth of the life

The Governor thanked Mr. Barber for
bis suggestion.

POLICE INVESTIGATING BURNING
OF FLAOS AS STATE'S CHURCH.
New York. June 2.—Bouck White, pas
tor of the Church of the Social Revolu
tion, who last night participated in the
^turning of the American flag ana
•ther national emblems in the rear of
his church, was. today found guilty by
the court of .special sessions of dese
crating the American emblem and was
sentenced to thirty days in the peniten
tiary and to pay a fine of $1,000. The
«ffense of which he was convicted today
was the desecration of the American
#ag in circulars he caused to be dis
tributed some weeks, ago.
Investigating Burning Flag*.
Police Commissioner Woods ordered
today an investigation of the burning
last night of the American flag and.na
lional emblems of other nations in a
"melting pot" in the rear of Bouck
"White's church of the Social Revolution.
The affair was described by White as
"the birtli' of internationalism." It is
alleged that the American flag was
thrown ifl tlje"'flames by Albert Henkel,
described as! an, artist, who afterward
unfurled a banner of "International In
dustrialism!"
The Police Commissioner said today
that, if the facts were as reported, ft
was" an outragsi,' that should not be tol
erated." He directed a. deputy to confer
with the district attorney and said if
that official believed the participants in
the "melting pot" episode should be pun.
ished, the detectives would obtain the
•evidence.
Meanwhile White wit, piAceu on trial
•on'the charge of having desecrated the
American flag several weeks ago on cir
culars which he caused to be distributed.
Before he was arranged in court *he is
sued a statement in which he referred
to the burning of the flags last night as
•"the tnost beautiful exhibition I have
•ever had the pleasure of seeing."
"It consisted", he said, "of melting
the flags of the present super-prevalent
nationalism, flags symbolic of the war
ring nations. By melting them together
-we hoped to unite the world brotherhood
which has for the last two years be.n
shedding its blood. It would be 'ie.
greatest godsend to this country if like
ceremonies were held in every city front
fcere to the Pacific coaBt."

Bismarck, June 7.—The popularity of
Henry Ford, as shown by the vote cast
ifor him in several states at the Pres
idential primaries for the presidency, is
alarming politicians. In face of his
protest that-he was not a candidate and
his reiterated statement to the public
asking them not to vote for him, he re
ceived a very large vote in several of
the states, and more particularly in
Michigan, Nebraska and Montana. Al
though in some instances he was placed
upon the ballot by stickers, yet he re
ceived a a large vote indicating that his
ideals were popular with the people.
Had Mr. Ford announced himself for
the presidency and made an actives cam
paign, he could have gone to the Na
tional Convention at Chicago with a del
egation from a number of states.
This popularity can be attributed to
but one thing—the desire of the Ameri
can people for peace. *In spite of the
criticism as to his attempt to create
peace sentiment in Europe, yet the same
people who criticised voted for him.
The managers of other presidential
candidates are astonished at the senti
ment for Mr. Ford throughout the Unit
ed States, as it seems to be confined .to
no particular state or 'section. Tho
great masses of the people are horrified
at the European war, and as the only
way of expressing a protest it seems to
be by voting for Mr. Ford for President,
and in this way making their protest.
This admitted popularity of Mr. Ford
is causing uneasiness among the oppon
ents of Governor Hanna for the United
States Senate. Wherever Governor
Banna appears lie is freeted by large,
interested and enthusiastic crowds, and
the thinking, sober peace loving people
of the state appear to be for Hanna for
the United, States Senate for the same
reason that they are for Ford for Pres
ident.

"Unfair" Tote Taken.
The final step towards precipitating
a strike was taken last night when the
Butte Workingmen's union unanimously
voted to declare "unfair" all employers
who have refused to concede the de
mands of the union for a wage advance
of 50 cents a day.
The union also voted'that all compan
ies, corporations, or contractors who
have refused to grant the wage increase,
or who fail to meet the demands in the
future, shall be considered "unfair."

All members-of the union were urged
to refuse to work anywhere for less

Uismarck, June 7th.—That North Da
kota is in the midst of business pros
perity is evidenced by the bank depos
its wlycli have reached a.grand total of
$12n.142.885.03 or almost $200 per capita
Ten years ago they totaled but $27.G30,
117. an increase of almost five fold. It
would be difficult to duplicate this re
markable increase in the wealth of any
state in the United States.
The loans and discounts of tli.- banks
in the state have reached the large
total of $99,893,415.49. This du.-s not
represent, by any means, the totr.l
amount o'f borrowed capital in North
Dakota. It is probable that the people
of the state are paying interest on $300,
000.000 of borrowed money.
While not all of this large amount
would be effected by the lowering of the
legal and contract rate of interest ef
fected by the last legislative assembly,
yet it is probable that a considerable
portion was effected by the lower rate
of interest and the saving per year to
the people of the state in interest is
estimated at two and one half million
dollars.
Governor Hanna was the first gover
nor in North Dakota to recommend a re
duction of interest rates in the state.
In his message to the 14tli legislative
assembly he said: "1 would recommend
that the contract and legal rate of inter
est be lowered from 12 to 10 per cent",
and the recommendation was enacted it
to law.

TO BUIIID ARMOUR PLATE
Washington, June 1.—Amendments to
tho naval appropriation bill to provide
for a $11,000,000 government armour
plate plant, for $3 000,000 instead of $2,
000.000 worth of aeroplanes, for 2,730 ad
ditional sailors and for a bonus system
to encourage .the speedy construction of
warsl,",)s. were adopted yesterday by the
house, sitting as a committee of the
whole.
Party linos were broken down en ev
ery vote. Twenty-three Republicans
and two Progressives joined the Demo
crats in \oting for the armor plate pro
posal. the final vote being 165 to 91.
Thirteen Democrats lined up with the
Republicans on the. additional aeroplane
amendment, which was carried 129 to
103. The bonus and increased personnel
amendments were adopted overwhelVn
ingly without roll calls.
Debates on the armor plate amend
ment. whicii already had been passed as
a separate bill in the senate, centered
largely around the question of whether
the Bethlehem Steel company, the larg
est private manufacturer of plate, had
treated the government fairly in dealing
with it.
Representatives Butler and Graham of,
Pennsylvania waged a fight against the
naval committee amendment, offering as
a substitute an amendment by Mr. But
le(r looking to a settlement of the contro
versy between the government and pri
vate manufacturers through a Federal
trade commission. .The Butler amend
ment would have provided for an appro
priation for building a government
plant but made its use contingent upon
the refusal of private manufacturers 11
accept contracts at prices judged by thu
coivmission to be fair.
