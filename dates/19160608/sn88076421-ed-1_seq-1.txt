GREATEST NAVAL
BAM IK WW
HAS EVER IHIOWH
Germans Gain Decided Advantage
Ov.r English When Many Great
Battleships Were Sunk.
The greatest naval battle of modern
times was fought in the North sea
Wednesday, May 31. From accounts
at hand when this is written, the Ger­
man fleet obtained a decided advan­
tage in the battling, although opposed
by the stronger British fleet. The na­
val battle took place between the
Skager Rack, the arm of the North
Sea jutting into the Scandinavian pen­
insula, and The Horn, a cape on the
west coast of Denmark, about 100
miles north of the German fortress of
Helgoland.
Whether the Germans met the Brit­
ish by design or accident is not stated,
but the fact that the Germans made a
stand of several hours indicates the
British did not surprise the Germans.
The German battle fleet undoubtedly
is provided with every possible facil­
ity for scouting and communication
and it is difficult to believe the Ger­
mans were not aware of the presence
of the British.
If they were taken by surprise, how
ever, the fact remains the Germans
stood by their guns, for the number of
destroyers and torpedo boats sunk in
the engagement proves conclusively
the battling was at comparatively
close range and was not a running
fight.
The German admiralty announces
that among the British vessels sunk is
the Warsprite, originally carrying
fifteen-inch guns and later said to
have been armed with sixteen-inch
guns, but the Associated Press reports
some months ago said the Germans
were overhauling their capital ships
in the Kiel canal and adding heavier
armament.
If this is correct it is not surprising
that the Germans were ready to meet
the British fleet, although it included
the Warsprite. With fighting at com­
paratively close range, as it appears
to have been, some of the smaller
units of the German fleet possibly
could have sunk the Warsprite, if the
report of its sinking is true. When
this was written the British admiralty
had not admitted the loss of the War
sprite.
London, June 5.—A total of 333 of­
ficers were killed in the Jutland bat­
tle, according to a list issued by the
admiralty today. The list shows that
practically all officers of the cruisers
Queen Mary, Invincible, Indefatigable,
Defense and Black Prince, and from
the destroyers Tipperary, Turbulent,
Ardent, Nomad, Nestor and Shark per­
ished. All the officers except one from
the cruiser Warrier were saved as
were all the officers from the destroy­
er Sparrow Hawk. On the other the
ships's 23 officers were killed and 22
wounded.
London, June 5.—British officers of
the fleet which participated in the Jut­
land battle have returned here identi­
fy the two German warships sunk as
the Hindenburg and Lutzow. The Lut
zow, a battle cruiser of 26,000 tons,
was built in 1915. She was armed
with eight 12-inch, twelve 6-inch and
twelve 24-pounder guns, and equipped
with five torpedo tubes.
FOR NORMAL
The Week of June 18-23 Will Be Busy
For the Students—Some Splendid
Programs Arranged.
Definite details for the Normal
School Commencement, week of June
18-23, are being arranged, with the
events of greatest interest to the gen­
eral public already fixed. Baccalau­
reate services will be held Sunday ev­

8:30, the final performance of the play
will be given, with an admission fee of
50 cents. There will be music, vocal
and instrumental, at both perform­

all proceeds from these performances
exceeding expenses incurred in pre­
sentation, be expended in some public
enterprise. Thus far it has been ap­
plied on a fund the classes have given
toward memorials left to the school.
On Wednesday, 8:30 p. m., the
Model school commencement exercises
will take place. They are presenting
an operetta, entitled "The Smuggle
men," in which about sixty seventh

ation, 39 in the one year elementary
course and 8 in the advanced course.
All the commencement events will
take place in the gymnasium with the
exception of the banquet. The public
is invited to all with the exception of
the alumni banquet. There is no ad­
mission fee except to the class play.
Large Class of Elks Initiated.
The Minot B. P. O. Elks lodge held

remembered. Fifty-one candidates
received the degrees. Work was
started in the afternoon and a supper
was served at the Home at 7 o'clock.
The main initiatory work was given
in the evening and all of the candi­
dates declare they got their money's
worth. The Minot Lodge No. 1089
now numbers nearly 700 members.
Herman Matson Precariously 111.
Herman Matson, a prominent farm­
er residing about fifteen miles north­
east of the city, is lying in a very crit­
ical condition in-St. Joseph's hospital
in Minot. He was taken ill with ap­
pendicitis and an operation was per­
formed Saturday night. Doctors say
that he cannot possibly survive.
"Dad" Green, Sawyer's candidate

England's Greatest Soldier Enroute to
Russia Lost—Warship Torpedoed
or Hit Mine.
London, June 6—Great Britain is
mourning the loss of her most noted
military chieftain, Field Marshall
Earl Kitchener, head of the British
war office.
Kitchener, with members of his
staff, was aboard the British cruiser
Hampshire, which was sunk last night
off the Orkney islands, and he with all
others aboard the warship have been
lost.
Admiral Jellicoe, reporting the sink­
ing, says the vessel was sent to the
bottom "either by a mine or torpedo."
Supposedly Kitchener and his staff
intended to consult the Russian mili­
tary authorities regarding the Russian
offensive expected to relieve the Teu­
tonic pressure on Verdun and the Ital­
ian front.
When the news regarding Kitchener
and his staff was received in London,
a meeting of the British war council
immediately was called. Sir William
Robertson, chief of the imperial staff,
who probably will become head of the
war office Sir Edward Grey, secretary
for foreign affairs Reginald McKen
na, chancellor of the exchequer, and
David Lloyd George, minister of mu­
nitions, were present at the council.

Kitchener, who was appointed sec­
retary of state for war on August 8,
1914, soon after the British declara­
tion of war on Germany, is regarded
as England's greatest soldier.
Of several things that entitle Earl
Kitchener to a place in world history,
the most notable is that he organized
the largest volunteer army the world
has ever seen, in the greatest war of
all times.
Within a year from the sudden out­
break of the European war in'August,
1914, the ranks of British fighting
men were quadrupled by an increase
from less than one million to nearly
4,000,000.
He was born June 24, 1850, in Coun­
ty Kerry, Ireland, a fact that gave
rise to a general belief that he was of
Irish blood, but his parents were of
French and English descent.
Within a few hours after England's
declaration of war, Kitchener was ap­
pointed secretary of state for war and
immediately took full charge at the
war office, where he worked day and
night to overcome the handicap which
the central powers had over England
in the matter of fighting strength.
He grimly told the British people
they had a bigger war on their hands
than they realized, and one that might
last longer than they expected, but it
was to be faced with entire confidence,
and he, unsmiling, almost like a de­
humanized machine, set about to make
things hum.
t:
cure information and assistance with
his car when it may seem to need at­
tention. When one considers that the
majority of automobile owners are
new beginners and can hardly be ex­
pected to know for a certainty wheth­
er or not their cars are running right,
and if not, what steps should be taken
tr remedy the trouble, one will apprec
iate the great advantage there is in
being able to secure advice and actual
mechanical assistance, if it is required,
without cost.
The Overland factory today, is man
ufacturing one thousand of the cele
brated Model 75 9615.00 Overland
automobiles every day and we are in­
formed that the production of this, one
model for the 1917 season is scheduled
at more than 200,000 cars.
Two Daily Papers at New Rockford.
Two new papers have appeared at
New Rockford. The New Rockford
State Center was issued Monday even­
ing-. J. N. Southrad, formerly with
the Fargo Forum, is the general man­
ager, and J. H. Worst, formerly pres­
ident of the state agricultural college,
is the managing editor. The Daily
Center has installed a fine equipment
consisting of two linograph machines
and a Goss press. Editor Olson has
started a daily which he calls The
Daily Capital, the name that the other
paper Intended to use.
Socialists Win School Election.
At the Rolling Green No. 129 school
election held at the Tucker school
house Tuesday, the following were
elected: M. S. Williams, 3 years
Theo. O. Mork, 2 years R. S. Wagon­
er, treasurer. There were 34 Social­
ist ballots cast. J. E. Goulden, the
clerk, who was the only democrat
present, did not vote. Not a republi­
can voted, as it was known that they
were whipped before the polls opened.
Boden Babe Passed Aw iy.
Russell, the fourteen-months-old
son of 'Mr. and Mrs. S. S. Boden, died
Friday afternoon at 5:30 o'clock after
a short illness from spinal mcin.^itis.
The funeral was held from the home
Sunday afternoon at one o'clock, in­
terment being made in Rose Hill cem­
etery. The funeral was conducted by
Rev. A. L. Shute, pastor of the M. E.
church. Mr. and Mrs. Boden and
family have the sympathy of many
friends over the death of their babe.
Wolf Von Neida, son of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Von Neida, former resi­
dents of Minot, died at his home at
Williston very suddenly from heart
trouble the first of the week. He was
about 26 years of age and married.
He was the only son. Wolf lived in
Minot for several years when a boy,
attending our schools. Many friends
will mourn his death.
PIAN FOURTH OF
IV CElfBRATION
Committee Working on Plans for the
Greatest Time Minol Has Ever
Seen—Riverside Park Secured.
The Fourth of July Executive Com­
mittee met Tuesday evening and
started the ball rolling- for a big cele­
bration which bids fair to be just as
good as the one last year, if not bet­
ter.
The park board has given the mer­
chants the use of Riverside Park for
the celebration. The Independent can­
not give many of the details in this
issue, but our readers can expect more
next week. There will be amusements
of various kinds, ball games, band
concerts, athletic events, boat and
swimming races, fire works, red lem­
onade and everything that goes to
make up a first class Fourth of July
celebration.
The executive committee consists of
D. W. Bowker, Eldon White, A. B.
Dill, J. C. Smallwood and Otto Elli­
son. Other committees have been ap­
pointed and are now working.
The idea is to give a great many
free entertainments and to invite o.ur
friends from many miles around to
join us in celebrating the day.
At the celebration a year ago it is
estimated that 20,000 people enjoyed
the festivities and with weather per­
mitting, we can expect fully as large
a crowd, or larger, at this one.
Watch Deering Grow.
Editor F. Roble of Deering motored

BY FRIGHTENED COLT.
Sherwood, June 5.—Fred Jesmer,
aged 16, son of Dr. and Mrs. E. A.
Jesmer living north of town, met a
tragic death when the young lad went
to get a colt that was tethered out and
in some way became entangled in the
rope. The colt took fright and ran
around the pasture several times with
the youth dragging at the end of the
rope. When released by his brother
and taken to the house it was found
that the skull was fractured. Dr. Dur
nin was summoned but the boy died
before the doctor reached there.
Wolf Von Neida Died Suddenly.

partment store on the strength of his
position, leaving town immediately af­
ter. It is said that he owes the Had

INJURED IN IOWA
MAIL CRASH
Nine Bodies Recovered and Four
More Are Known to be Missing—
Mrs. Unzen Fatally Injured.
Green, Iowa, June 3.—Rescue work
at the Packard wreck has resulted in
the finding of nine bodies, eight of
which have been identified. Four are
known to be missing.
The bodies of Mrs. Wescot, Mr. Lap
and Alvin Thoen were found this af­
ternoon down stream from where the
wreck occurred Friday morning, seven
miles south of Greene, when a bridge
over Flood creek gave way and let the
day coach fall into the creek. It is
believed that all but Mrs. Van Vliete
drowned, she having been injured in­
ternally.
Searchers are devoting all of their
time in dragging the creek and search­
ing along the banks They believe that
no more bodies will be found in the
partly submerged coach. Many in­
jured persons are being given treat­
ment in local hospitals, three of whom
i-.re believed to be fatally injured.
These are Mrs. M. E. Thoen of Ken
sett, Iowa S. L. Case, Henry 111., and
Mrs. Henry Unzen, Minot, N. D.
Railway officials state that they
hope to have the bridge so train ser­
vice can be resumed Tuesdav.
The Minot woman, Mrs. Henry Un­
zen, who is said to have been fatally
injured, left this city not long ago ac­
companied by her husband for a visit
with relatives in Iowa. Two of the
Unzen children are still in Minot. The
above is the only word that has been
received concerning the accident.
Good Piece of Business.
It cost Ward county $455.93 for elec­
tric lighting during the year just
ended, the electricity being furnished
by the Consumers Power Co. The year
before, when the county manufactured
its own electricity, the cost amounted
to $2175, not figuring the depreciation
and interest on the $4200 plant, and
with the increased cost of gasoline,
the price would run still higher. This
is a good piece of business on the part
of the commissioners, who adopted the
present plan suggested by Peter Van
denoever, commissioner from the First
district.
Must Build New School House.
The Supreme court has decided the
school board in Norway school district
must build a new school house about
three miles east of Minot, sustaining
the decision of Judge Leighton in an
action brot by J. C. Johnson ex rel,
against Thorwald Mostad, D. J. Ma
honey and Oliver Saugstad, members
of the board. The school board claim­
ed that they did not have to measure
the distance around by road if there
was a section line, regardless of the
fact that the line has a coulee and is
impassible. W. H. Sibbald was attor­
ney for the petitioners.
Atty. Lesk in Auto Accident.
Atty. Lesk was thrown out of an
auto in Riverside park Monday even­
ing when the machine skidded on the
slippery driveway, striking a tree. A
large piece of bark was torn off the
tree and the auto damaged. Mr. Lesk
was not badly injured.
