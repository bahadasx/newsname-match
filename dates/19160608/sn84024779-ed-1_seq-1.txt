of the class, she said that she was
proud to be able to secure the ser
vices of Mr. McVey as lie was the
heed of our slate educational in
Hit ulions and she was followed
by Mr. McVey. who said.
"I'm here this evening to give
a commencement address, which
is .11 a time when a certain part
of our young manhood and young
womanhood is passing from one
stage of life, into another. Bui
even with these changes there is
yd. three filings to consider, and
I hat is "character, cash, and in
terest in life."
"Without character your life
will nut be what it should he, and
to have character, you will have
ail its synonyms, \Mhich includes,
punctuality, truthfulness, hones
jly. and many others. He dwelt al
long 011 this phase of his subject
for about fifteen minutes then he
changed to cash.
"Cash, yes c:ish, for without
cash your life will he a failure to
a certain extent. For without cash
you will lose a whole lote of the
