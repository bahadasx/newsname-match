a better flavor than fish of any
other stream in lower soutn uarolina,
the Edisto not excepted. The
fry had visitors from Colston and
Clear Pond.

CHARLESTON TO BUILD SHIPS.
Yard to Be Suitably Equipped.?Naval
I^ill Amended.
Washington, June 1.?The amendment
to the naval appropriation bill
adopted by the house this afternoon, |
authorizes the secretary of the navy
to expend $6,000,000 to equip the
navy yards on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts for the construction of
battle craft if he is unable to secure
fair bids for such construction from
private contractors. The provision
includes the Charleston yard and the
secretary is authorized, under the
condition stated, to have constructed
at the Charleston yard such craft as
that yard is capable of putting out.
Congressman Whaley, when interviewed
tonight, stated that he was
delighted with the provision, as it
means that the Charleston yard will
get its share of the construction work
incident to the increased building
programme carried by the naval bill.

LORD KITCHENER KILLED.
British War Secretary Lost When
When Ship Was Blown Up.
London, June 6.?The news that
Earl Kitchener, secretary of State for
war, and his staff, who were proceeding
to Russia aboard the cruiser
Hampshire, were lost off the Orkney
Islands last night, was tne most siunning
blow Great Britain has received
since the war began.
This is the second shock the country
has sustained within a week. The
other was when the newspapers appeared
Friday evening with the first
intelligence of the naval battle in the
North sea in the form of a list of the
ships lost, with practically no intimation
that there was any compensation
in the way of enemy losses. The
bulletin telling of the death of Kitchener
gave the country even a greater
shock.
^Kit^hener was the one outstanding
personality whom the people talked
of and believed in as a great man,
notwithstanding newspaper attacks,
which at a former period of the war
threatened to undermine his popularity
and the public confidence in
him.
Jellicoe's Report.
A telegram from Admiral Sir John
Jellicoe, commander of the fleet, giving
the bare facts, was received at
the admiralty about 11 o'clock in the
morning. The first official announcement
was issued at about 1:30 in the
afternoon. Before noon, however,
rumors were spreading.

miralty follows:
"I have to report with deep regret
that his majesty's ship, Hampshire,
Capt. Herbert J. Savill, R. N., with
Lord Kitchener and his staff on
board, was sunk last night at about
8 p. m., to the west of the Orkneys,
either by mine or torpedo.
"Pour boats were seen by observers
on shore to leave the ship. The
wind was north-northwest and heavy
seas were running. Patrol vessels
and destroyers at once proceeded to
the spot and a party was sent along
the coast to search, but only some
bodies and a capsized boat have been
found' up to the present. As the
whole shore has been searched from
seaward I greatly fear that there is
little hope of there being any survivors.
"No report has yet been received
from the searching party on shore.
"H. M. S. Hampshire was on her
way to Russia."
SENATE CONFIRMS BRANDEIS.
After Bitter Contest President's Nominee
Wins Out 47 to 22.
? >- x? r -i nnv. ?
wasiiiiigton, j uue x.?iHe nomination
of Louis D. Brandeis, of Boston,
to the supreme court to succeed
the late Joseph Rucker Lamar was
confirmed by the senate today by a
vote of 47 to 22. ' The vote, taken
without debate, ended one of the bitterest
contests ever waged against a
presidential nominee. Mr. Brandeis
will be the first Jew to occupy a seat
on the supreme bench.
Only one Democrat, Senator Newlands,
voted against confirmation.
Three Republicans, Senators La Follette,
Norris and Poindexter, voted
with the Democratic majority, and
Senators Gronna and Clapp would
have done so, but were paired with
Senators Borah and Kenyon. The
negative vote of Senator Newlands
was a complete surprise to the senate,
and the Nevada senator, recognizing
that his action had aroused
comment, later made public a formal
explanation.
"I have a high admiration for Mr.
Brandeis as a publicist and propagandist
fUcHnrtinrs " said Senator
UlOVi VI U1UV1AA VA v y _
Newlands. "I do not regard him as
a man of judicial temperament, and
for that reason I have voted against
his confirmation."
Throughout the fight President
Wilson stood, firmly behind his nominee,
never wavering even when it
seemed certain that an unfavorable
report would be returned by the senat
judiciary committee. Before the
committee voted he wrote a letter to
Chairman Culberson strongly urging
prompt and favorable action.
The Reason Why,
At the close of his talk before a
Sunday-school, the bishop invited
questions. A tiny boy with a white,
eager face, at once held up his hand.
"Please, sir," said he, "why was
Adam never a baby?"
The bishop coughed in doubt as to

GREATSEA BATTLE FOUGHT
FOUGHT BETWEEN BRITISH AND
GERMAN VESSELS.
Both Sides Claim Big Victory.?Apparently
a Draw.?About 30 Battleships
Disabled or Sunk.
London, June 3.?The latest reports
from the British admiralty,
from neutral vessels which witnessed
parts of the great naval battle in the
North sea and from survivors, cause
the British public to believe that the
engagement was not so near a defeat
as it first appeared, and in no
wise a disaster. The British losses,
with all the craft engaged accounted
for, were three battlecruisers, three
cruisers and eight destroyers.
The German losses are believed to
have been about the same number of
ships, although a much smaller aggregate
of tonnage.
British naval experts maintain that
Great Britain continues to hold the
supremacy of the sea by a safe margin
and that her enormous navy
could better afford the losses it suffered
than could the smaller German
establishment. The first' reports of
the heavy loss of life, unhappily,
fiave not been revised. Great Britain
mourns for more than 4,000 of
her best seamen and the whole nation
is oppressed with sadness,
which is reflected in the faces of all
the people of London.
There were some 6,000 men on
the ships which sank, and only a few
hundred have been saved. The horrors
of modern naval warfare, far
exceeding those when wooden ships
fnuerht and continued to float even
when they ceased to be fighting units,
were realized to their utmost. From
t five of the largest ships which went
under with a complement of more
than 4,000 men only seven junior
officers and a few seamen were rescued.
Rear Admiral the Hon Htfrace
Lambert Hood, second in command
to Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty,
and Capt. Sowerby, Capt. Cay and
Capt. Prowse were lost with many
others. There were no surrenders
and the ships which went down carried
with them virtually their whole
crews. Only the Warrior, which was
towed part of the way from the
scene of battle to a British port, was
an exception.
Of some thousand men on the
Queen Mary, only a corporal's guard
is accounted for. The same is true:
of the Invincible, while there are no
survivors reported from the Indefatigible,
the Defense or the Black
Prince.
It is impossible to visualize any
coherent story of the great battle,
which lasted many hours, with thej
different units at times fighting scat-|
tered engagements. The British and!
German reports contradict each other
flatly on the main fact. The British
assert that the German fleet retired
when the British battleships appeared,
while the German official statement
maintains that the German
forces were in battle with the entire
British' fleet.
The British assert that they had
only two divisions engaged and that
all the units of these were not ablej
to participate in the fighting and,!
furthermore, that Admiral Sir John |
Jellicoe, commander of the grand
fleet, swept it thoroughly in search
of enemy ships and survivors.
Vice Admiral Beattv, commanding
the battlecruiser squadron, presumably
on his old flagship, the Lion, was
again in the thick of the action.
Every arm of the most powerful naval
warfare was employed?battleships,
cruisers, torpedo boats, destroyers,
submarines and even Zeppelins.
Whether most of the destruction
was accomplished by gun fire or
torpedoes is not yet known. British
officers say that the battle was fought
by the methods known and practiced
by all navies. There were no surprises
and no new devices of weapons
or strategy. How far the Zeppelins
contributed to the German success is
a matter of dispute. Only one airship
came within sight, according to
the British accounts, and she was
soon badly damaged and withdrew.
But the Germans lay stress on the
assistance rendered by their air service
and neutrals report the presence
of six Zeppelins in the North sea.
The popular belief among the British
' * x ~ i ?-> 7onnolitia
PUD11C IS UlctL &CUUI1115
kept the German fleet informed by
wireless of the approach of their enemy
and of his numbers and formations.
British Voctory, Says London.
London, June 4.?The British admiralty
tonight issued a statement
I). w. DANIEL ELECTED.
Well Known Educator and Lecturer
Choice of Columbia College.
?
a
Columbia, June 1.?D. W. Daniel,
for eighteen years professor of English
at Clemson college, was tonight
unanimously elected by the board of
trustees president of Columbia college,
to succeed the Rev. W. W.
Daniel, D. who recently resigned.
The board was in session practically
all of today, several names being under
consideration. President Daniel
is a native of Laurens county and a N
graduate of Wofford college, and
prior to going to Clemson taught
school in several sections of the State.He
is one of the best known educators
in the State and has a wide reputation
as an orator and lecturer.
? ??? ?????wmmmm ??? ???
saying there was the strongest
grounds for the belief that the British
navy in the battle with the Germans
off Jutland last week had accounted
for a total of eighteen German
men-of-war and that there was
% r:?3
nothing to add to or subtract from
the original announcement of the
British losses.
The statement gave the German
losses as two battleships, two dreadnaught
battle cruisers, four light
cruisers, nine torpedo boat destroy-?
ers and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed as.
a result of the admiralty's original
statement of losses, which is now considered
to have been needlessly candid
and conservative in under-esti
mating the extent of the German ' -*4
losses as compared with those of
Great Britain, has been greatly lessened
by the latest statement. i
A dispatch from Copenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
two additional German warships than
those announced in the German communication?the
battleship West*
falen and the battle cruiser Lutzow?
were sunk in the battle. A wireless
dispatch received here Saturday from
Berlin said the German admiralty
admitted the loss of the Westfalen.
Absolutely Greater.
The admiralty statement tonight
declares that the German losses in
the fight were not only relatively but
absolutely greater than those of the
British. Maintaining its practice ofcaution,
the admiralty still refrains
from giving the names of the lost -
German ships.
The official list of the casualties
among officers shows that hardly a
single officer of the line escaped from
the British cruisers sunk in the bat-*
tie. An additional casualty list of
' 'iiS
petty officers shows that forty-three
of them were saved from the Queen

None was saved from the Indefatiga/ble,
Defence, Black Prince, Tipperary,
Turbulent, Nomad or Nestor.
The list gives the names of sixtyfive
men killed aboard the Warrior
and of twenty-seven men wounded.
On the other ships engaged in the
fight 115 men were killed and 85
wounded.
Admiral Lord Beresford in an interview,
while contending strongly
for the view that there was no failure
in the British strategy and that
Vice Admiral Beatty won a brilliant
success, though it was dearly bought,
declared that the only mistake made
was by the admiralty in allowing the
Germans to get first in the field with
the news of the battle, or as he puts
it with "impudent fabrications."
Otherwise, said Lord Beresford, no
fault can be found with the admiral- ty*
'H
Big Battle Pleases Germans.
Berlin, June 3.?The first naval
- pa
battle on a grand scale during the
war has been attended by results
which, acording to information re:-2
ceived here, are highly satisfactory
to the Germans not only in respect of
the comparative losses of the two
fleets but in the fact that the Germans
maintained the field after the
battle. This is shown, German commentators
assert, by the rescue of
their survivors.
The full German high sea fleet was
engaged under personal command of
Vice Admiral Scheer, who succeeded
Vice Admiral von Pohl. The British
fleet is estimated at approximately
twice as strong in guns and ships as
that under Admiral Scheer.
Detailed reports have not yet been
received, but the main engagement
apparently occurred about 125 miles
southwest of the southern extremity
