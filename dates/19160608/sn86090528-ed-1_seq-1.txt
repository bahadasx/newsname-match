Wilson's Foreign Policy; Moose,
Strong lor Preparedness
By T'nited Press.
Chicago. June 8. It was learned on
the highest auttiority this morning
that the platform which will be adopt
ed by the Republican national conven
tion today takes a strong stand for
Americanism, declaring for a fearless
navy, and for a sufficient army to
form the nucleus of a mobile war
force. '
It is certain that a national prohibi
tion, plank is not included in the plat
form and a woman suffrage plank has
not yet been inserted, but it. will be
further considered by the members of
tha resolutions committee.
Thj committee adopted a plank
which proposes that the government
take over the complete regulation of
transportation, eliminating the numer
ous state commissions.
The platform declares for industrial
preparedness, the encouragement of
militia In training a citizen army, but
ogainrtt compulsory military service.
As it now stands the platform also
demands protection for American
lives and property always but it does
not declare regarding intervention in
Mexico. It declares for a protective
tariff and the restraint of monopo
lies against undue, exactions.
Tho platform committee further de
clares in favor of the literacy test for
immigrants to prevent the influx of
illiterates in tbirf country after the
war and another plank pledges sup
port for a child labor law.
Liberal compensation for mail ships
whichmny be requisitioned in war
times is favored but the platform op
poses government ownership of ves
sels. .
It Is declared by the platform that
the Republican party stands for a con
sistent foreign policy to restore thv na-'
tion to its rightful place in the world
and the foreign policies of Wilson are
strongly criticized.
Moose Platform.
The Moose platform will be adopted
today. It declares for a regular army
of a million and a quarter men and the
second best navy in the world, it
calls for the nationalization and fed
eral control of military forces of all
kinds. Preparedness and American
ism are the kevnotes of the platform.

Things in Future
A roseate future for f'hlckasha and:
surrounding Country . .is foreseen by
Col. J. I). Sugg, prominent capitalist of
San Angelo, Texas, wii .i heavy invest-
ments here, who was in the'' city today.
He is the owner p! the Sugg theater
structure ami the First National bank
building, and also one of the directors
of the First NationaLbanl.
"1 am well pleased with my invest
ments in Cliii kasha," said Col. Sugg.
"1 made, my aioucy in this country
years ago ami I always felt that I
wanted to put some of it back U'M'e.
Of course, you must, remember, lle.n
Johnson, whom 1 lined to hold in my
arms when he was a baby, mesmer
ized me a bit, but at the same time I
am perfectly sfied with the invest
ments I have 1. and 1 think this
country Is going to lie much better in
the future. You have a better climate
than we have in my part of Texas
more rain and less wind and you
have excellent, railroad facilities and
you get far cheaper electricity than
we do. I can see nothing to Interfere
with the steady progress of Chiekusbu
in the future."
Before the stream of settlers had
wended their way to the Indian coun
try, Col. Sugg operated in cuttle on a
large scale in this section and it was

. With Mikado
(Hy William G. Shepherd, Uuitod
' Press Staff Correspondent.)
London: May 23 (By uiaIl.)-Prm-bertou-Dllling,
who is trying to awaken
England in the matler of the mastery
of the air and who made the charge
in the British parliament to which ho
has been recently elected that BrllifiU'
airmen wero being murdered, wore a
purple dressing gown and called m
"old sport" as he sat at his breakfast
table being Interviewed.
Once or twice he called to his secre
tary. Btandliig nearby. "Where in th
world is my breakfast? Why doesn't
someone bring me my breakfast?"
"Have you ever been iu the Uuiled
Stales?" ' J ' '
"Yes." ,,
"Do you suppose the United States
,!,, it be awakened in the matter ot
air service?"
"Not uulil you begin i.o pet som'
hard biimpn. You'll 'get tlwm oaw'
day, too. from the Japaueae."
Pembertnn Billing hiis raised such a
tumult, conversationally, in England
about the. air Pervke that his ideas
of how great and extensive the air wsr-'
vice should be mada are o Interest. '
His idea Is to have tho air service'
tho 'urea I est arm of the British forcea.
He believes that II can be made mora
powerful tli.ii it Ihe navy.
"I contemplate a force cf 100,001)
iieroplanes soon, and a force of 230.-
iiOO within the next teu ye.iri. In Ron-
eral there ought. I be live ditfeinnt
kinds of aeroplanes. First, there will
he a wcout, small, and very fci.it.,'-An-,
other will be a heavier mftclilmj,. ftr-.
mored, for bomb droppftiit. carrying,
perhaps, one bomb.
"The third sort will be a cheap ami
hfcge machine, made la vast itu.iati
ties, for ordinary battle purpose.
"A transport, aeroplane hill rank
next In Importance. It will be capabia
of carrying from 15 to 25 men from !
one part of a battle' Hue to another
and also or moving guns, ammunition
and other supplies; It will probably
have five or six decks." Such a ma-'
chine would rank as the army motor
bus. -
There are going lo be huge battle
planes in the future that will carry
batteries of perhaps four five-i' eh gun
or three nix-inch guns with fire con--trol
like 'battleships and with a rap
tsin and crew."
"Get your army and your navy. too.
into the sky. Make your enemy come
into the sky to fight. Move your
troops In the sky; feed them in tho
sky; let theni live in the ky. Just na
Napoleon used to force bis opponents
to give battle on fields which he him
self had selected, so let the genera li
of the wax-to-be force their enemies
to conic up into the sky to pieet them."
This is the philosophy of rember
tou Billing's rnmra lgn.v
I lie h.i a very definite idea of til
:p);me that would be made for the use
j -if the ordinary "inf,ii,tr men'' of th
sl.v. I lie machine that w ould ineke up
jtlu- tmlk of the sky flotilla.
"We would stamp the winga out ft
nM:ii. by i he thousand.. The part-!,
vou 'd be siai'dardizcd. The frauv;i
would hp of s'eel tubing and
(Inn);, vPnld be put together (juicit.lv,
'trmigly .iiid scienl ifically, like you i.r
America put together yjur email, pop
ular automobiles thet vou make by th
Ihousands. .The pre-war cost of such
aeroplanes would have been abont a
thousand dollars apiece."
From details. he new member, el

that, the more lrrlbn war becnnie,
