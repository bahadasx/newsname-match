UNION TO OPEN
COMMISSARIES
Cloak Strikers Will Be Given
Food at Eight Central Dis
tribution Centers
Eight commissary stores will be
put in operation by the International
Ladies' Garment Workers' Union end
the Joint Hoard of the Clonk and Skirt
Makers' Union to provide food for the
100,000 New York men, women and
children affected through tho lockout
by the Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufac
turers' Protective Association. The
employers have declared their deter
mination to starve the workers into
submission, so the commissary stores
will be an important factor in the un
ion's fight. President Benjamin
Sohlesinger, of tho International Un
ion, said that the commissary centers
"will act as a direct reply to the star
vation policy which is back of the em
ployers' lockout, and will give the
strikers all the necessities of a live
lihood."
These centers will be established
under the name of the "Cloak Makers'
Co-operative Stores."
These big stores will carry supplies
of bread, butter, potatoes, flour, eggs.
herring, sugar, tea and coffee, and
will be distributed free to the strikers
presenting strike cards. Arrange
ments have been made with milk com
panies to supply milk to the strikers
in their homes. A number of delivery
companies have volunteered to fur
nish delivery trucks and autos, should
it become necessary to deliver sup
plies to the homes of the strikers.
The International Ladies' Garment
Workers' Union intends to invest
$250,000 in these provision stores. - A
committee, to locate vacant stores and
lofts for the commissionary centers,
consisting of Miss Mary Dreier, Miss
Florence Wise, Miss Malinda Scott
and Miss Mose Schneiderman, of the
Women's Trade Union League, has
been appointed, and it is putting these
plans through with all possible speed.
The Manufacturers' Association has
not met with success in the attempt
to win the workers back to the shops
by denouncing the union leaders. Let
ters mailed to all strikers charged the
strike was brought on by the officers
to fill their pockets. At a mass meet
ing of strikers, the following resolu
tion was adopted in reply to the asso
ciation's letter:
"We regret the crocodile tears our
bosses are shedding over our bitter
circumstances, and we are very thank
ful for their promises which they have
found necessary in their last 'literary'
announcement to their dear 'unem
ployed workers.' Under their sheep
skins beat wolves' hearts, a fact well
known to workers from their bitter
experiences of many years. We be
lieve our condition can be bettered
only through our own efforts, through
unity in our mighty organization.
"With full confidence we hurl back
the accusations against our organiza
tion and against the men at the head
of the organization. The shameless
ness of the bosses did not surprise us.
We wish to assure them that we know
who are our leaders and who are our
misleaders, and therefore we declare
that, through the help of our organi
zation we will carry on our fight as
long as it will be necessary, until we
achieve the victorious end."

UNION MASS MEETING DISCUSSES
ACTION OF THE COMMERCIAL CLUB
Adopts Resolution Calling Upon Business sMen
of Everett to Withdraw from the Club on
Account of Unfair Action Taken
Several hundred men and women
gathered Sunday afternoon in tho
City park In response to a call issued
by organized labor to discuss the ac
tion of the Everett Commercial Club
at a recent session declaring against
the shingle weaver strikers and for
the "open shop."
Thomas Alllman presided. The ses
sion lasted two and a half hours.
Those who spoke wore: J. G. Brown,
president of the International Shingle
Weavers* Union; E. C. Dailey, G. W.
I.outtit and R. J. Faussett.
The following resolution was adopt
ed at the meeting:
"Whereas, Some days ago the board
of directors of the Everett Commer
cial club made an alleged investiga
tion of the strike of the shingle weav
ers of this city. Without inviting a
shingle weaver, without seeking a
particle of information from the Shin
gle Weavers' Union, and without the
authority of the membership of the
club itself, the one-sided conclusions
of the directors were given to the
press with the clear intention of cre
ating prejudice in the minds of the
public against the striking shingle
weavers. Later, when the matter was
to be considered by the entire mem
bers of the club, a request was made
that the shingle weavers be given an

FORCE UP THE PRICE OF THE
BLOOD AND SWEAT OF LABOR
By J. L. Engdahl.
Labor's biggest opportunity is here!
Let labor unite and make the most of
this grand opportunity!
There were never so many workers
in the land demanding more bread for
their families, more hours of leisure,
better conditions under which to la
bor.
There was never such a demand for
organization on the part of the men,
women and children who toil, as now.
The desire to struggle for some
thing better is in the heart of labor,
TODAY! It is a struggle full of life
and hope.
This struggle must be crowned with
success.
It can be crowned with success be
cause:
Never before has the army of the
unemployed been thinned to its pres
ent proportions; its ranks so depleted.
Never before have the masters of
industry been bidding for the brain
and brawn of labor as they are doing
now.
Never before has the voice of labor
been as commanding as now; sounded
so threatening to the ears of the mas
ter class.
Labor must make a big step in ad
vance now because:
When the war is over, as it soon
must be, the hordes of the hopeless
will leave the shores of Europe and
come to the United States looking for
jobs, to compete in the labor market.
When the war is over the munitions

thousands of workers will be thrown

opportunity to present their side of
tin' ease. This request was promptly
refused, and without hearing the shin
gle weavers' side of the case at all,
the report was adopted; and
'.'Whereas, This report is biased,
prejudiced, one-sided, and untrue; it
deals with the question of the open
shop, which is no part of the shingle
weavers' demand, it was inspired by
the mill owners and passed by those
whose interests are with the employ
ers.
"Therefore, Be it Resolved, That
this mass meeting of Everett citizens
hereby voices its resentment at the
shingle weavers being denied a hear

erett Commercial club, and hereby
pledges itself, indivdiually and col

patronizing in any way any member
of the Everett Commercial club; and,
further,
"Resolved, That we call upon all
business and professional men, who
share our injured feelings at the un
fair action taken by the Everett Com
mercial club to immediately withdraw
from that institution, and at the same
time notify organized labor in writing
of their actions to the end that our
friends may not be unconsciously in
jured by our actions at this time."

I out of employment, the unemployed
army will be recruited again to its full
strength; the workers will be bidding
against each other for the jobs.
When the war is over the millions
of soldiers in Europe will return to
their jobs across the sea, and there
will be no call for the products of
American labor.
The labor situation in this country
today is the product of 21 months of
bloody slaughter in Europe. In the
early months of the war, the skilled
labor needed in the munitions plants
demanded and received increased
wages. The eight-hour day was won
almost over night, especially by the
machinists, where previous years of
unremitting struggle had not brought
it about.
Workers were drawn to the war in
dustry from other industries. The
opportunity to fight and win grew
and grew. Note the rebellion of la
bor in the Pittsburg district. See the
thousands leaving the gates of the In
ternational Harvester company and
other huge corporations in Chicago
and Milwaukee.
There were no unemployed to take
their places, no freshly arrived hordes
of immigrants from Europe hungry
for jobs. Labor went on strike and
factories and mills closed. The solid
arity of labor was irresistible.
Labor is losing its fears and fore
bodings. It is willing to fight. Win
ter is gone. Spring is urging the mass
of toil to take up the battle for its
rights.
When the Milwaukee munitions
manufacturer warned labor to stick
to its sausages, sauerkraut, and black
bread, for the present prosperity
would soon be a thing of the past, he
was merely voicing his own fear.
Labor intends to have something bet
ter.
When the Chicago money monarch,
from the bottom of his granite heart,
advised the workers to "Cut out the
nickel shows and SAVE," his advice
fell on deaf ears. ~
The price of the sweat and blood of
labor is going up. Let it mount high
er and higher. Let it rise until it. has
absorbed all the profits of capital.
Labor's biggest opportunity is here.
Let labor everywhere unite and
make the most of this grand oppor
tunity.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Lexington, Mo., is now completely
in the hands of Miners' Union No. 171.
They became tired of being used as a
lot of voting dummies, by old party
bosses. So they elected one of their
members as mayor and five other
councilmen, although they were de
nounced as Socialists, anarchists, in
fidels, ingrates, etc., by the bosses,
who combined against the workers.
Because the editor of a Socialist
paper in Finland printed a picture of
the Socialist members of the Russian
Parliament who were banished to Si
beria he was sentenced to one year in
prison for "arraying class against
class." The picture showed the So
cialist deputies in convict dress on the
way to their place of banishment.

300,000 WORKERS ON STRIKE
REPORT SAYS
According to a statement of the
Department of Labor, strikes and lock
outs throughout the United States
have been unusually numerous.
The last six months produced 1,009,
and, in April alone there were 268
Most of the April strikes, the report
says, were due to the demand for la
bor to fill war orders. Decreases in
immigration have brought about a la
bor shortage, although immigration is
now picking up.
It is stated that the largest number
of the strikes have been in the metal
trades in many states. More than
half were in New York, Massachusetts
Pennsylvania and Ohio. April strikes
involved about 300,000 workers.

OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE SOCI ALIST PARTY OF SNOHOMISH COUNTY
SECOND "ZIMMERWALD" MEETING OF
SOCIALISTS CALLS FOR WAR ON WAR
Conference Declares Ruling Powers of Capitalist
Society Must Bear Responsibility for
Europe's Great Conflict
A second international conference.
of Socialists, similar to and growing I
out of the one held at Zimmerwald
last September, met at some place in
the Homer Oberland in the last week
of April.
There were present three members
of the French Chamber of Deputies—
Pierre Brizon, of Allier; Alexandre
Blanc, of Vaucluse, and Raffin-Du
gens, of Isere; five Italians—Prampo
lini, Morgasi, Modigliani, Musatti and
Dugoni; two Germans—A. Hoffman,
member of the Prussian Landtag, and
11. Fleissncr, member of the Alsatian
Landtag; from Serbia, T. Katzlero
vitch; from Switzerland, Graber,
Grimm and Name. The French and
German comrades present were not
official representatives of the party in
their countries.
It is stated that several members of
the German Reichstag tried to come,
but were prevented from crossing the
frontier; also that a number of Eng
lish, French, Austrian and Hungarian
Socialists were hindered by the au
thorities from attending.
War Blame on All Rulers
The conference issued a manifesto
addressed to the working people of all
lands, which begins by putting the
responsibility for the war on the rul
ing classes of all the belligerent na
tions, without distinction, repeating
the following paragraph from the
manifesto adopted at Zimmerwald.
The ruling powers of capitalist
society, in whose hands lay the
fate of the peoples, the monarchi
cal and republican governments
alike, the secret diplomats, the
great employers' organizations,
the bourgeois practice, the capi
talist press, the churchesall
these must bear the responsibility
for this war, which has grown
out of the social system of which
they are the beneficiaries and the
advocates and which is being
waged for their interests.
After almost two years of slaugh
ter and destruction, says the mani
festo, after millions of men have been
killed and other millions crippled, mil
lions of families cast into mourning,
ruins piled on ruins and priceless pro
ducts of civilization destroyed, the
warring nations find themselves in a
blind alley. No decisive result has
been obtained, and the governments
think only of hurling still more mil
lions of men into the caldron of blood
and fire.
Conflict Means Ruin for All
"No victors and no vanquishedor
rather, all vanquished, all ruined, ex
hausted, bled white—that will be the
balance-sheet of this war. The ruling
classes may assure themselves that
their fantastic dreams of imperialistic
world-domination are not on the way
to fulfilment.
"Courts continue to prove that only
those Socialists have served the inter
ests of the peoples to which they be
long, who in spite of calumny and per
secution, have stood out against the
nationalistic frenzy and demanded im
mediate peace without annexations.

.the governments and the imperialist
cliques and their press are telling you
that you must 'stick it out' (durch
halten) in order to liberate the subju
gated nationalities. Of all the mis
leading cries that have been raised,
this is the grossest.
What Real Aim Is
The actual aim of this gigantic
slaughter is, for some of the govern
ments, to confirm what they have won
in numerous wars of conquest in cen
turies past; for others, to make a new
division of the spoils in order to en
large their own share, to annex new
territories, to dismember more peoples

"They control the lying press that
poisons the public mind. They have
full freedom to agitate for the con
tinuation of the war. You are the
victims. You have only the right. to

"While they wage their class strug

than before, they preach to you the
gospel of 'Burgfrieden'—of peace be
tween classes. While they ruthlessly
exploit your poverty and need, they
seek to make you commit treason
against your class and take away
from you your greatest strength, your
faith—Socialism."
The manifesto welcomes the grow
ing demand for peace in all countries,
and closes with an emphatic appeal to
the Socialists of both the neutral and
the belligerent nations to redouble
their efforts to arouse the masses
against the war-lords, to resume the
class struggle at home and force the
speedy ending of the war, without
annexations, indemnities, or ahy other
concessions to imperialist greed.

It took Governor Ernest Lister, who
sometimes boasts that he was "once
a union man," to-appoint to the posi
tion of State Labor Commissioner,
which ever since its inception has been
held by a member of organized labor,
a non-union man. If the governor
keeps on in just this way the Repub

various commissions and their em

ever built up by any governor in any
state. —Union Record.

I. S. S. at Meeting Hears of the
Growth of Co-operatives in
Europe in Spite of War
When the whirlwind of the Euro
pean war struck the co-operative
movement of the various countries,
belligerent and neutral, it unexpected
ly changed to a life-giving zephyr,
with the net result that in England
alone 176,000 new members were ad
mitted into the Co-operative Stores
League in 1914. This and other facts
were presented at a discussion meet
ing of the New York Chapter of the
Intercollegiate Socialist Society.
"This increase was more than twice
the increase during the year before
the war," said Albert Sonnichsen, edi
tor of the Co-operative Consumer. He
added:
"There is not a country in Europe
in which the co-operative movement
does not show an enormous increase
since the war. Particularly is this
true in neutral countries.. In Switzer
land the co-operatives have grown so
strong that not long ago they engaged
in a struggle with the meat trust, the
most perfect combination of its kind
in the world, and in a week they broke
it. By the use of the boycott the
Swiss co-operative movement forced
the meat trust to ask for terms and
brought it out."
Dr. J. P. Warbasse, the chairman,
said, in sketching the nautre of a co
operative: "A group of consumers
get together to buy more cheaply.
They grow, perfect their organization,
buying from the wholesaler in quan
tity until they become wholesalers
themselves. When there are a suf
ficient number of wholesalers, they
become wholesalers themselves, de
velop on this level until they are
strong enough, and then go back to
the point of production and become at
once producers and consumers."
A striking point brought out by Dr.
Warbasse was that while the German
government was seeking to enlist the
aid and support of the Socialist move
ment in the conduct of the war, it was
now, as always, bitterly and unceas
ingly fighting the co-operative move
ment.

fully, the entire business of packing
sardines may be revolutionized. The
inventor, who is now working on de
vices for cutting and eviscerating her

said to have practically perfected a
machine that will displace the hun
dreds of female operatives and that it
will automatically put the cooked fish
in the cans as neatly as it can be done
by hand.
The sealing machine introduced
fifteen years ago threw ninety per
cent of the male labor out of employ

its first appearance and was thought
impossible, but subsequent events
proved it to be entirely practical and
today none of the two million cases
of sardines packed in Maine are sealed
