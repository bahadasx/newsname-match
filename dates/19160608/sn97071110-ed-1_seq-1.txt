For Tomorrow
We have turned up the whole store to meet the
demands of men and young men who insist on get
ting the most their money can buy.
We're looking for the fellow who is supercriti
cal, who knows goods clothes when he sees them
and refuses to purchase anything anywhere that
isn't guaranteed to satisfy him absolutely.
To carry out this program we offer clothing ,
from a house with a nation-wide reputation for
superiority. Superiority of style, fabric, tailoring,
fit and finish, second to none.
Kuppenheimer Clothes
$18 $20 $25
Fine Suits at $15
There are, we know, a host of men and young
men who do not care to spend more than $15 for
suits. To them we offer the finest suits at $15 ever
shown in Hood River. We do not claim them to be
$18 to $20 values. We don't sell them on bargain
basis.
Everyone asks this question many
times daily.
We are all dependent upon the time.
Our lives are regulated by our
watches.
The lack of a watch is a big handi
cap to both men and women.
Therefore, why try to get along
without one?
Let us show you a good watch; one
you can depend upon. We can suit
both your taste and your pocketbook.

We acknowledge the compliments of the
editor in last week's issue, with apologies,
but our path is not one continuous road of
successes by any means, nor is our farm so
spick and span as many readers may infer
from the comments of the editor.
In farming there are so many conditions
that we cannot control, and that even with
the best of appliances and knowledge at our
command, some seasons show only a small
return on the investment Only by speci
lizing in certain crops, by using commercial
mineral fertilizer, by employing trustworthy
intelligent help and paying fair wages and
above all, by marketing a product that is
Non Pareil (nothing better) have we gained
the first round in the ladder, that is, the
appreciation of our Non Pareil Vegetables
by a just customer. ,
We just ask
you to see 'em
with the
usual run of
t
clothes at this
price to con
vinceyourself that a "Fif
teen" is some
suit for the
- money.

Forestry Service Will Aid in Bufldiof
Highways to Moist Hood and
Lost Lake
Cooperating with official! of the gov
eminent forestry service, citizens of
Hood River county are endeavoring to
secure the construction of two roads to
"points declared by those who have vis-
. A J 1L L- .U- - k 1
i Leu tuem io ne tua roust appealing
from a scenic standpoint in the coun
try. One of the proposed highways
will pierce the foreste on the head
waters of the West Fork of Hood river
and, when constructed, will carry the
automobile or wsgon to the shores of
Lost Lake, while the other, connecting
with county thoroughfares in the Up
per Hood River valley, will pass
through the national forest on the
northwest base of Mount Hood ana end
at the very snowline of the peak near
Cooper's spur. -
The proposed highways will not only
make accessible the mountain grand
cur, but they are actually necessities
to the forestry service in the preven
tion of devastating fires in the national
forest.
: As early as 25 years ago the people
of Hood River county realised the
scenic asset of Lost Lake, and follow
ing agitation of several years a rosd
wis constructed to the point by funds
secured through subscription. No
means of maintenance, however, was
provided, and the roadway is now
washed full of deep ditches and over
grown with underbrush. One msy
ride to Lost Lake on horseback and it
is possibiewto reach the region with a
wagon. But huge boulders and fallen
logs bar automobiles. Even with a
wagon the trip at present is such as to
try the strength and patience of the
hardiest frontiersman. Yet despite the
barriers scores of the ranchers of the
valley travel to Lost Lake each year.
Especially is this true of the families
of the pioneer class. Lost Lake is a
mecca that is thought oi and talked ot
from one year's end to the other.
Early autumn ia the favorite time for
the trip, the recreation of the rancher
following the harvest oi nay crops ana
preceding the apple harvest The
forest abounds in wild game and huck
leberries grow there in hundred acre
tracts. On the return home the pack-
horses may be loaded with the skin of
a bear or the carcass of a buck. Cans
of the luscious fruit from the wild ber
ry bushes are destined to nil shelves of
the ranch housewife.
Lost Lake is a veritable fisherman's
paradise. Indigenous to the Iske's
waters is large, red meated.Mhick
trout, similar to the Lochleven. The
native fish, however, are very wily and
will bite only under certain weather
condition. The Hood River Game Pro
tective Association three years ago be
gan to stock the lake with rainbow
trout and steelhead salmon. Since the
work was undertaken 100.000 fry have
been transported into the lake by the
organisation. Some of the young flsb
were transported to tne lane in cans
thrown across the backa of pack
horses.
Lost Lake huckleberries are rivaled.
perhaps, by but one other section of
the northwest,, that around the Indian
race track near Trout Lake. The Lost
Lake berries are said to be larger than
those of Trout Lake, but they are leas
known because of the inaccessibility of
the former community. Until four
years ago scores of Indiana came annu
ally from the Warm Springs reserva
tion to pick the fruit on the shores of
Lost Lake. Some of the Redmen, with
commercial tendencies, brought the
berries to Hood River in big woven
baskets slung across the backs of pack
ponies. - They were rewarded by a
price of from 75 cents to $1 per gallon.
In the fall of 1912 an early storm
prevailed on Lost 1 ake. Accompany
ing a heavy dow. pur of rain the wind
blew ten ideally, punctuated by thun
der and flashes of lightning. An old
squaw was struck by a thunderbolt. A
pitiful cortege wended its way out of
the forests the following day, bearing
to the reservation burial place the dead
body of the woman. The tragedy was
taken aa a sign from the Great Spirit,
and until this day the Indians of the
Warm Springs reservation have sought
their winter supply of huckleberries in
nthnr apptinna.
The huckleberries grow meet abun
dantly on Zigsag mountain, the aides
and top of which were burned over
some half century ago. The great area
is comparativey free ot other under
brush, and one can fill a gallon pail
with the big berries of Zigzag moun
tain in a very few minutes. On the
esat side of the lake on the aides of
Butcherknife Ridge, as the range is
called, is a younger growth of huckle
berries of large area. Butcherknife
Ridge waa burned over about 25 years
aso. The name originated from the
diaeoverv bv a pioneer hunter of
butcherknife i.T.beded in rotting log
near the top of the ridge.
Count? roads are already completed
to the remote headwaters of the West
Fork of Hood river, and while but few
familiea of the eitv Denetrate the for
ests aa far as Lost Lake, many of
them have summer camps on some
hranch of the stream in the virgin
wilds. The women of a number of lo
cal families spend the entire summer
months at these camps, the men, kept
at home by business affairs, motoring
out for the week end. Those who hsve
tried outings at both plaeea declare
that they prefer that of the Lost Lske
country to a vacation on me aeaanore
The road leading to the Upper Weat
Fork of Hood river, which will eventu
ally be traveled in reaching Lost Lake,
baa ita points of scenic attraction.cbief
of which ia the Devil's Punch Bowl,
ahera at the foot of a small falls the
swirling watera of the West Fork hsve
scoured from basalt eolumna a gigantic
nrnnrf haain. The Heat columns rise
a sheer 100 feet on one side of the
seething bowl. At thia season of the
year steelhead and chinook salmon, in
ihair endeavors to iumr the 10 foot
falls, furnish an interesting spectacle
for the sightseer. Many of the great
flab succeed in negotiating the cascade
and hurrv awav to the headwaters of
the river to spawn.
Automobilists at the present time
reach the snowline of Mount Hood by
the toll road leading to Cloud Cap Inn
The route, however, eicept for power
ful maehinea, ia impaaaable because o
the exceedingly heavy grade, loo to
of f 5 for each automoblle'alao makes it
objectionable and has probably pre
vented a large number or local automo
bile owners from making the journey.
Funds collected; inltolfs. it ia aaid bv
the management of the Inn, are not
sufficient to maintain the road, and
those in charge of the faoatelry will
gladly foster the better road, which
will follow an easy grade.
The road over the new route has
found a booster in CountyXommiaaion-
er Hannunv a resident of the Upper
Valley, through 1 whose instigation a
aurvey of the proposed road waa made
last fall by Harry furrow, who was at
that time county engineer.
MOOMAW OPTIMISTIC
OVER FOREIGN DEAL
Fresh from London and the thrills of
Zeppelin raids, S. B. Moomaw, general
European agent of the Apple Urowers
Association and other prominent apples
sales agenciea throughout the north
west, arrived here last week for his
snnual conference with local shippers.
Mr. Moomaw is the largest distributor
of American boxed apples in Europe,
snd despite the chaotic conditions at
tendant on the European war has by
his close study of the workings of the
foreign market succeded in the past
year in placing at handsome prices
200,000 boxes of the Northwest's fruit
abroad. Seventy five per cent of the
apples handled by the foreign agent
were shipped by the local Association.
The total tonnage sent abroad last
year from the Northwest reached 428,
655 boxes. "More than 60 per eent of
this," ssys Mr. Moomaw, "was con
sumed in the British Isles."
Mr. Moomaw ia optimistic over the
prospects of next year and states that
so far as be can judge by present Indi
cations the consumption of fruit abroad
ill be limited not by any embargo
that may be laid by the British govern
ment, but more because of the limita
tions of shipping facilities.
'And 1 expect more space will be
available next fall than during the
shipping season of last year," he says.
'British shipbuilding yards are busily
engaged turning out new bottoms to
take the place of those destroyed by
mines or submarines. With large num
bers of troops already taken to the
continent, many of the transports will
be turned back into mercantile service,
and I know that many ships that have
been doing hopsital service will be put
into the Atlantic trade, the wounded
having been transferred to hospitals in
England."
The British government, according
to Mr. Moomaw did establish a fruit
embargo, but it affected only dried,
preserved or canned goods and not
fresh apples. We had some of our
hipments, routed to Copenhagen, de
layed last spring by the British gov
ernment, but thia was caused, merely
that autboritiea might make proper
search of the abipment in order to as
certain that something other than fruit
waa not being shipped in the cargo of
applea. By the aid of Embassador Page
and Consul General Skinner, the applea
were released amicably.
"I have learned, however, aince my
return to Northweatern fruit growing
centers that certain agents of three or
four English importing firms are giving
out the impression thst fruit importers
will be subject to a license the coming
shipping season and that their concerns
alone will be permitted to handle the
product. I anticipate the licenses, but
my dealera will immediately take ad
vantage of the regulationa and we will
continue to handle Northwestern ap
ples just as former years.
"The eoverntnent took op the ques
tion of a fresh fruit embargo last year.
When it waa mentioned that American
apples might be affected, protest from
thousands of small fruit merchants at
once poured in to the central Board of
trade, and in the face oi sucn puonc
sentiment the government waa heard
to say no more of an embargo on ap
ples. 'American boxed apples seem to
meet the needs of the English trade.
t hey are the stock In trsde ot hundreds
of small grocers and fruit dealers, and
must say that the Northwest boxed ap
ple is the chief favorite. So accustomed
have the English people become to the
Yellow Newtown, ss grown at Hood
River, that during the past year I sold
my supply of this variety at a prem-
um oi two atiillings above Itne ruling
quotati a cf other varieties.
'There are so many things, however.
to be taken into consideration In the
face of the war situation that it would
be foolish to make any definite predic
tions." Mr. Moomaw says- that he experi
enced two very thrilling moments last
fall when Uerman Zeppelins were raid
ing London.
"Last September a bomb wsa drop
ped from one of the big air craft with
in about 40 yards from where I was
standing, and some 150 people were
killed," he says. A few weeks later
in October, one of the bombs dropped
from a Zeppelin exploded within a
stone's throw from my offices.
"Never in my life nave I ever en
countered such nerve as the British
people are displaying at the present
time. They have deterimned to puraue
the war to the very end and they are
determined to win. British patriotism
waa given a new turn by the Zeppelin
attacks. These have aided in recruit
ing, and but for those air raids I do
not believe the English people would
ever have tolerated a conscription act.
"Despite the war. most of the cor
porate buaineasea of the British Isles
are booming, ahowing a stimulus over
times of peace. The British laborer
waa never making more money, and he
spends freely. For this reason, if we
get the fruit to him, apple aales will
be made easily and at profitable re
turns to growers.
"I he Scandinavian countries, too, are
in a prosperous condition, and we are
expectins their business to continue
good, if we had been able to ship the
product, I really believe that we could
have handled at the aame pricea twice
the tonnage of Northwestern boxed
applea shipped during the past season."
After a visit at the important fruit
eenters of the Northwest Mr. Moomaw
will go tor a etay at his .homo in Vir
ginia, were he is from a pioneer fruit
family. Ha will return to London in
August

LITTLE JOURNEYS IN -
THE MID-COLUMBIA
To the local motorist who desires
half day's run, every moment of which
is chockful of pleasure and sightseeing,
the trip to White Salmon and Under
wood may be suggested, it you want
to make it a full day you may do so by
proceeding from Underwood Heights
into the Little White Salmon valley
and thence up to Chenowith and Okala-
home.
At the present time it is necessary
to take the Hood River-White Salmon
ferry to reach Underwood. From the
ferry landing on the Washington shore
take the road leading to the east up
the side of the goreside to the town of
White Salmon. From this road you
will enjoy the view of the symmetri
cally laid out farms cf the Columbia
lowlands. After passing torougn wniie
Salmon, keep on the main traveled
roads and swing through the orchard
and berry district back to the gorge oi
the White Salmon river. First on this
road you will strike a point where the
route is intersected by the road leading
down to Underwood. Do not take this
road, but proceed about a mile and a
half and you will see a little aide road
leading through orchards. Take thia
and you will atrike the White Salmon
at the lake formed by the 100 foot dam
of the Northweatern Electric Co., built
across the narrow chasm here. Then
awing to the west and you will get a
glimpse of the dam itself and later the
big power bouse, where electricity used
in heating a portion of Portland'a busi
ness district ia generated. The roads
along the lake and leading by the dam
and power bouse are privately main
tained by the power concern. They are
thrown open tn the public, however.
After crossing ue wniie ssimon
river and climbing out of the canyon
you will strike the nisin road of the
Underwood district, ine turn to tne
right at this point Ss a shsrp one, and
you may have some aimcuity u your
car is a long one.
By following this main, well traveled
road you will reach on '.an easy grade
the rim of the Columbia gorge at un
derwood Heights. A new section of
the North Bank highwaythrough Ska
mania county has been constructed
here, and from it the motorist is given
a grand view of the Hood River valley.
Numerous little side roada penetrate
the Underwood orchard communities,
and the traveler can spend hours profit
ably taking them and learning some
thing of the progress snd development
of the neighboring fruit community.
On the return trip take the grade
leadmer down to the ferry landing from
C. W. J. Reckor'e "Eyrie."
Conmunity Pack Appeals to Growers
Following plana adopted by other
fruit sections of the Northwest, local
apple growera may adopt the commun
ity system of packing fruit on a large
scale. A meeting waa held last Thurs
day in the Pine Grove district for the
discussion or central packing meinooa,
which it is claimed will not only insure
a more standard pack of apples, but
will eliminate unnecessary expense and
enable growera to place their applea in
storage In a minimum of time.
Approximately iuu.uuu ooxea ox ap
plea on the Eaat Side have been pledged
to a community packing aystem for the
Aople Growera Association members.
At a meeting held Saturday night C
E. Coffin and Dr. Stanton Allen were)
appointed a committee to secure ton- -nsge
for the proposed new community
to secure packing plant, which in all
probability will be erected in the Pine
Grove district before the harvesting
season begins this fall.
