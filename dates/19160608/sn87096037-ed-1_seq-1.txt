Ask us to tell you about the Willys-Knight.
VOLUME 3FI. No. HOPE. STEELE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, JUNE
With Use
There is a delightful thrill in the smc./amcss with which
the Willys-Knight motor "picks up" without "choking"—
without the slightest vibration.
There is great satisfaction in being able to throttle
it down to a walking pace on high gear.
But the remarkable superiority of the Knight sleeve-,
valve motor lies in the fact that—•
Though all other motors grow noisy and lose power
and smoothness—
The Knight sleeve-valve motor grows steadily quieter
with use and increases steadily in power, smoothness and
all-around performance.
The factory'r, enormous production made- it possible to
price this wonderful car at $1125 for the touring car, and
$1095 for the Roadster.

North Dakotans Prosperous.
Bismarck, June 7th.—That North
Dakota is in the midst ol business
prosperity by bank deposits which
have reached a grand total of $125,
142,885.03 or almost $200 per capita.
Ten years ago they total but $27,630,
117, an increase of almost five fold. It
would be dillicult to duplicate this re
markable increase in the wealth in
any state in the United States.
The loans and discounts of the banks
in the state have reached the very
large total of $90,693,415.49. This
does not represent, by any means, the
total amount of borrowed capital in
North Dakota. It is probable that the
people of the state are paying interest
on $3000,000,000 of borrowed money.
While not all of this large amount
would be effected by the lowering of
the legal and contract rate of interest
effected by the last legislative assem
ble, yet It is probable that a consider
able portion was effected by the lower
rate of interest and the people of the
state in interest is estimated at two
and one half millions dollars.
Governor Hanna was the first gover
nor of North Dakota to recommend a
reduction of interest rates in the state.
In his message to the 14th legislative
assemble he said "f would recommend
that the contract rate of interest be
lowered from 12 to 10 per cent," and
the recommendation was enacted into
law.

The first issue of The Daily
Capital, published at New Rock
Jord in the Transcript office by
A. C. and Len. J, Olson reached
our desk last week. The paper
is well started and when the
state capital is moved there it
will be assured long life and
prosperity. It was stated at one
time that a company had been
formed to purchase the Tran
script plant and establish a daily
but the deal fell through and as
a result the paper was started
by the Messers. Olson.
The Griggs County Pair As
sociation has gathered a line of
attractions^ and amusements that
will be hard to beat at any Coun
ty Pair in the state. There will
be aLive Stock exhibit second
to none and with the industrial
exhibit filled the patrons of the
Griggs County Pair should have
no trouble in getting their
moneys worth at Cooperstown,
N. D. June 29-30th and July 1st.
