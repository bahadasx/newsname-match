WHY BUSINESS MEN DEMAND
ABSTINENCE ON THE PART OF
THEIR EMPLOYEES.
(By Montrose Ballard, 7th Grade South Main
street School)
When one man employs another
in any capacity whatever, his first !
thought is efficiency because every
one wants the maximum amount of
work for . the least amount expended
and it is a well known fact that one
addicted to intoxicants is usually
physically unfit for any position re
quiring an active brain and steady
nerve.
Medical experts have proved be
yond a doubt that intoxicants dull
the brain, make the nerves unsteady,
quicken the heart action, thus over
working: that important organ, and
affect the eyesiglitQften causing
total blindness. "
An employer demands abstinence
on the part of his employees' because
he wams.?ne& whom he can trust,
men whowlh-dor their best to carrv
out his wisnes, without having to
have someone to stand over them
with a goad-stick.
They want sober men because
they want honest men, who would
steal neither their time nor money,
if they had the opportunity, 'and it
is only among men of imtemperate
habits that theving and dishonesty
are found.
Neither do business men want
employees who smoke. A visit to
any manufacturing plant will prove
this, for one of the first things to
greet the eye is a sign which reads,
"Notice No Smoking Allowed."
Whis smoking prohibited? In the
first place, the owners realize the
danger to their buildings, from the
match carelessly thrown aside after
lighting the pipe or cigarette, and
often from the partially burned
cigarette.

spirit, and with the proper amount

to have his associate know that his

and physical wrecks, such as whis

Imagine walking into your bank
to transact some business and being
confronted by one of the employees
with red face and blood-shot eyes, a
cigarette between his teeth and a
(hie) in his voice. You would not
wait until you got home to telephone
the directors what you thought of
them. No you d change your place
of business before going home.
Suppose on going into a store, a
clerk starts toward you, but staggers
around and finally falls, at the same

would not wait or care to see
whether he ever got up or not, and
if all the clerks were like that you

spent for whiskey and tobacco.
Why, if the money wasted in the
United States, for these two evils
alone, was spent in arming and
equipping our army and navy, we
would have ho cause whatever to
fear an invasion from any one
country or countries combined.
But alas! all these precious dollars
go to quench the thirst, and satisfy
the inordinate craving for whiskey
and tobacco, while thousands of
helpless children beg for bread and
while other thousands toil in sweat
shops, in order that their fathers
may have their daily glass of rum.
And Uncle Sam tries to wage war
with the pen instead of the sword.
Visit the jails, the chain-gangs,
the penitentiaries, ask the poor
wretches why they are there. In
nearly every case they will tell you
that whiskey started them on the
downward road.
Trace the origin of all the great
disasters of the world and in almost
every instance, whiskey has been
the direct or indirect cause.
- Take the case of the "Titanic", for
instance. They were drinking, danc
ing and making merry, deluded in
to the belief that no harm could
come to them. Had each officer'
and sailor been sober and on his job,
that dreadful disaster would never
have happened, with its attending
loss of life and prosperity.
Railroad officials want men with
active brains, and clear vision to
run their trains in order to avoid
wrecks which cause them so much
loss in destroyed property and
damage suits.
W ho would care to enter a pas
senger train, for even a short distance
knowing that the man at the throt
