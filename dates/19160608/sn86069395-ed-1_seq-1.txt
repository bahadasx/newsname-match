KITCHENER
IS DROWNED
War Minister with Staff Lost
When Steamer Sinks Off
Orkneys in North Sea. '
ALL ENGLAND 18 BADLY STUNNED
Was on Way to Russia De
tails of Disaster Are Not
Given Out.
London, June 7. Tho news that
Earl Kitchener, secretary of state for
war, and his staff who were proceed
ing to Russia aboard the cruiser
Hampshire, were lost off the Orkney
islands Monday night was the most
stunning blow Great Britain has re
ceived since the war began.
This is the second shock the coun
try has sustained within a week.
The other was when tho newspapers
appeared Friday evening with the
first intelligence of tho naval battle in
the North sea in the form of a list of
AtnA ...iiU ....i11ir rr tntimnHnn I
SUipS lUSk Willi VllbLUlllJ .iv timiimuuti
that there was any compensation in
the way of enemy losses. The bulle
tin tellimr of the death of Kitchener
gave the country even greater shock.
Kitchener was the one outstanding
personality whom the people talked
of and believed in as a great man,
notwithstanding newspaper attacks
which at a former period of the war
threatened to undermine his populari
ty and the public confidence in him.
GREAT CROWDS ASSEMBLE.
When the official announcement
was issued", ' tho fact spread about
London, some time before the news
papers could get Into the streets.
Tho windoiyaof-the warbffjc.ft had
the curtains lowered. That confirmed
the rumor bevond doubt. Otherr
crowds gathered around tho news
paper offices; when the boys came
out with an armful of extras tho peo
ple fell on them and fought for the
papers. In the course of the after
noon the flags on all buildings were
flown half mast.
MEMBERS OF STAFF.
Accompanying Earl Kitchener as
his staff, were Hugh James O'Beirne,
former councillor of the British em
bassy at Petrograd and former minis
ter at Sofia; O. A. Fitzgerald, Earl
Kitchener's private military secretary;
Brig. Gen. Ellershaw and Sir Freder
ick Donaldson. '
The English undoubtedly are a sto
ical people and have taken the good
and bad tidings of the war as they
came with an absence of emotion sur
prising to outsiders. But no one
could have walked the London streets
today without perceiving that some
thing which the- common people took
as a calamity had befallen them.
FOREIGN OFFICE SADDENED.
The foreign office was saddened by
tho loss of one 'of its most valued
members, Hugh James O'Beirne,
while Sir Frederick Donaldson and
Brig. Gen. Ellershaw of tho ministry
j 0f munitions were known to be
men
whom the nation could little afford to
lose.
The fact that the cruiser Hampshire
with between 2C0 and 3C0 men had
sunk was generally accepted as an
unfortunate detail in these days when
a thousand oro under almost as an
incident of warfare.
SUCCESSOR NOT DECIDED
The king came from Windsor and
sent for Premier Asauith when he
heard tho news. Tho war council
held a long session. 0 Naturally specu
lation regarding Kitchener's succes
sor began immediately. Among
those discussed were David Lloyd
George, Lord Derby and tho chief of
the imperial staff, Sir William Rob
ertson. But whether a military man
or a civilian will take' tho war office
lias not yet been decided.
Earl Kitchener met death at a mo
ment which will insuro his position in
British history. He was almost tho
only member of tho government who
from the beginning confidently as
serted that this would be a long war
his lowest estimate was three years
and he Mated that the government

Death in Wake.
MORE THAN 100 INJURED
25 Known Dead in Judsonia,
Where Third of Town
Is Swept Away.
Little Rock, Ark., June 5. Fifty
nine persons have been reported dead
and more than a hundred injured in a
series of tornadoes that swept Arkan
sas this afternoon. All means of com
munication are crippled and it is
feared the list of dead and injured will
be increased by later reports.
The dead thus far reported are as
follows:
Judsonia, White county, twenty-five
known dead and fifty injured.
Heber Springs, eighteen dead.
DeLark, Dallas county, four dead.
Cabot, White county, four dead.
Hot Springs, four dead.
Morrilton, one dead.
Greenland, Washington county, two
dead.
North Arkansas appears to have
suffered most severely, although the
storm was general throughout the
state.
At Judsonia, one-third-of the town
was said to have been swept away
I he tornado swept clean an area
of four blocks wide and twelve blocks
long. Twenty-five bodies and fifty
injured already had been taken from
the ruins at 10 o'clock, reports said.
Four persons were killed and heavy

should make its plans accordingly.
ORGANIZED BIGGEST VOLUN
TEER ARMY.
Of several things that entitle Earl
Kitchener to a place in world his
tory, the most notable is that he or
ganized the largest volunteer army
the world has ever seen, in the great
est war of all times.
Within a year from the sudden out
break of the European war in August,
1914, the ranks of British fighting
men were quadrupled by an increase
from less than 1,000,000 to
4,000,000.

S
President of Chinese Republic
Succumbs to Short Illness
of Stomach Trouble.
SOLVES POLITICAL CRISIS
Li Yuan Hung. Vice-Presi
dent and Successor, Ac
ceptable to Leaders.
Peking, June 7. Yuan Shi-Kai,
president of the Chinese republic,
died Tuesday. Premier Tuan Chi-Jui
immediately advised Li Yuan Hung,
the vice president, of his succession
to tho presidency.
Yuan Shi-Kai had been ill for sev
eral days with stomach trouble, which
was followed by nervous breakdown,
Quiet prevails today at the capitol.
The death of the president apparently
solves the heated political crisis. Li
Yuan Hung's succession to the presi
dency meets the demands of the lead
ers in the southern provinces.
Yuan Shi-Kai was reported to have
been seriously ill on May 28. At that
time dispatches from China said it
was believed in Peking that the pres
ident had been poisoned, but this re
port was denied by the Chinese am
bassador at Washington, who insisted
tho president was not even ill.
Yuan Shi-Kai died while the storms
of the revolution were gathering in
increasing strength. The revolt broke
out in December, 1915, when the
president announced his intention of
establishing a monarchy and ascend
ing the throne as the first emperor of
a new dynasty. His coronation was
set for early in February of this year
but was postponed indefinitely owing
to the extraordinary rapidity with
which the revolt spread through
southern China. Several attempts
were made upon the president's life
and a bomb plot was discovered in
the imperial palace.
MONARCHY IS OPPOSED.
The establishing of a monarchy was
strenuously opposed by Japan and the
final abandonment of the plan was
largely credited to the representations
made by Tokio.
The revolt progressed, however,
and in March the governors of the
Chinese provinces demanded the res
ignation of the president. In May the
provinces of San Shi and Shan Tung
announced their independence and a
provisional government was establish
ed by the general commanding the
revolutionary forces in the south.
President.Yuan Shi-Kai announced on
May 26 his intention to resign when a
suitable successor was chosen.
Mrs. G. C. Koffman has gone to
' Wctumka, Okla., to beat the bedside
of her mother, who is seriously ill.
