Firtt-if you subs,ribe Ito The

you not desire to pay in advance
then The tHeraIl costs you ten cents
per onth or for the six months
would be sixty cents. If you have
not paid for your paper in advance
and you owe for eight moniths you
owe The hlerald eighty cents. Should
you desire to become one of the ad

for you to pay all of your arearage
and then one dollar for another year
in advance. We trust that we have
made this plain. Fifty cents pays
for five months only. I
