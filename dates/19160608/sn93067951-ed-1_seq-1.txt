Clinton Gardner
Killed By Lightning
During a storm that passed
over this section Tuesday morn
ing. the lightning struck and
killed Clinton Gardner, the 10
year-old son of Mr. John Gardner,
near Friendship church.
Young Mr. Gardner was eni
gaged in hauling some oats to
the barn and was assisted by a
negro hand. At about 8:80, j
while both were in the wagon,
which was drawn by two mules,
a thunder storm arose. They
had presumably started to the |
house in the empty wagon, the ^
negro driving and sitting on the
right, side of the wagon, and the
young man sitting in the back
of the wagon on the left when a
bolt of lightning struck the
wagon, killing Mr. Gardner and
also the mule on the left side. *
The negro was stunned and the *
mule on the right was knocked
down but was apparently unin- ^
j u red. ^
The funeral oeeured at Morven,
N. O., on Wednesday. The ser- ^
vices were conducted by the
Rev. J. Tyler.
Rev. L'aul T. Wood, the pastor
was engaged at the time in con- ^
ducting a series of meetings at
L'leasant Grove and could not be .
notified.
This tragedy has made a pro- j5
fund impression on theeommun- ^
I ity. The family of Mr. Gardner
is held in the highest esteem
and Clinton was loved by all|I
who knew him. j '
Creamery Routes For
Chesterfield County v
?
Cheraw.?The Committee ap j
pointed at the mass meeting of j
farmers recently to canvass the
surrounding country for the
number of cows available with n
a view to the establishment of a '
creamery in Cheraw, met in the
town hall last Saturday morning. c
Besides the committee, W J. a
Filler, demonstration agent for .
Chesterfield county, S. C. Evans, u
demonstration agent for Marlborn
county, and T. S Evans, !
Seaboard Air Line railroad agri- 11
cultural agent attended, and a
gave useful suggestions.
The committee reports finding '
"Jib cows that could now be de- ^
pended upon tor cream, with the
premise of several hundred more tt
by purchase after the crops are c<
laid by. Upon this showing a r<
special committee, consisting of
SV- J. Tiller, John Hickson and vs
(J. T. A. McManns, was appoint- r'
ed to visit the Darlington cream ^
cry and arrange with them for ''
the establishment o f cream ^
routes around ('heraw, the M
cream to be shipped to Darling- tt
ton for the present. This com- *
mittee will go early this week
and report to the full committee b
next Saturday. b
Steps were also taken looking $
to the purchase of a large num- h
ber of cream cows by the farm h
ers, or by a stock company form- e
ed for that purp >se, so as to g
greatly increase the supply of fi
cream- L. J. Anderson fathered g
the idea of forming such a com p
par.y. The First National Hank 1
is willing to advance the money v
to purchase cows, upon notes indorsed
by responsible citizens, \
mortgage and insurance policy
as security, a first payment of j
about one-fourth the value of j
each having been made, the bal- jt
ance to t>e paid 1 ti small month- v
ly installments. ^
A mass meeting of (Chester- ^
field and Marlboro farmers, live j
stock men, hankers and others f
interested it; the commercial do- ^
velopment- of this section of the -j
State, will he held on a date
that will suit W W. Long, and (]
Mr. Kitzpatrick of Clemson, Mr. a
Napier,the demonstration agent 8
for Darlington county ami other y
experts who will he expected to j
give expert information on both \
the business and the dairy end v
uf the dairy proposition. This
committee will then also report
its findings and suggest the best X
plan to pursue in the future.

Mr. Matheson Declines 11
g Cheraw, May 20th, 1910. j
Editor The Advertiser: ?i
?. Will you kindly permit me, l|
through your paper, to thank 1|
all those who have manifested *
such friendly interest in presen- ?.
ting my name to the voters of R
j Chesterfield County as a candi- Bui
Ij date for the House of Represente
ative. I appreciate more than il
^ I can express all that has been
said both in public and in private,
about my fitness for the
place; and I appreciate also the
way in which the suggestion of
. my name has been received
throughout the county. I am
very conscious, however, nf
, fact that in this they are exer.
cising a high degree of forbearance
and generosity; but nevertheless
it is very gratifying.
The call, entirely unsolicited
. on my part, ha* appealed to me
more strongly than anything of v
. a like kind has ever done.
I am conscious, too, of the
force of your argument that I
owe a debt of gratitude to my
county that should be paid in
service for her. And frankly,
few things would give me more
real pleasure and gratification
than to have the honor of serving
my county, and through
it, my state in this capicy and at
this time. It is a transition
period, when many questions of
importance are mminor nn
? t-> " 1'
solution by our Legislature,
questions that have peen partially
dealt with and need completing,
and others entirely new.
It would be a privilege to be allowed
to take part in their proper
solution.
It is with real regret, therefore,
that I feel it to be my duty
to decline to make the race for
this office. If it were a matter
simply of some sacrifice of a personal
nature, 1 would willingly
make it. But obligations which
I have assumed for, and with
others, and which will require
the whole of my time and
strength and best efforts for the
present, force me to this decision.
I have delayed for a week
my answer in the hope that the
way might be open for me to
make the race; but now find
that I shall have to ask my
friends to withdraw my name.
I thank one and all, including
The Advertiser, for all that, has
been said and done in my behalf.
Very respectfully.
Donald 8. Matheson.
