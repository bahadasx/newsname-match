Boosevelt replied toilay to William P.

"In answer to your telegram, I can
only say that the matter lies with the
republican convention, and that if the
convention desire me to address it, I
idinll be glad to do so.
"I very earnestly hope that the re
publicans and progressives assembled nt
Chicago will keep steadily in mind the
gravity of this crisis, not only for
American, but for the world, and the
need that theoir action in diyiiity, fore
night and patriotism shall rise level to
to the crisis. I hope that the aim will

can be elected next November, but a
man of such power, charactor, steadfast
conviction and proved ability that if
elected he will again place this nation
where it belongs by making it true to
itself and therefore true to all man
kind. Wilson's Service Bad.
"President Wilson, however amiable
bis intention, has rendered to this peo
ple the most evil service that enn be
rendered to a groat democracy by its
chosen leader. He has dulled the na
ti(al conscience and relaxed the
npring of lo'i'ty, national motives, bv
teaching our people to accept high
(sounding word. as the offset nud atone
ment for shabby deeds, and to use
words whifh mean nothing in order to
draw all meaning from those which
bave a meaning. It will be no easy task
to arouse austere self respect which
lias been dulled to slumber by these
means. To this task, 'we should bend
our united energy in the spirit of Wash
ington and Lincoln, the spirit of gen
uine democratic leadership, the spirit
which sets the standard to which tho
nation ought to rise and then wiWi
confident hope appeal to the soul of the
Jieople so that they may in fact support
the standard thus ruised.
"The differences that have divided,
not merely republican and progressives
but good Americans of all shades of
political beliefs, from one another, in
the past,, sink into nothing when com
pared with the issues now demanding
decision for these isaes are vital to the
national life. They are the issues of a
unified Americanism and of national
preparedness. If we are not all of us

if we have not developed a strength

"Uncle Joe's" Statement That

By Perry Arnold.
(United l'ress staff correspondent.)
Coliseum, Chicago, June 8. The re
publican national convention marked
time today, awaiting its platform tram
ers' report. In the marking time pro
cess, tho delegates were treated to a
session of oratory by such old time
wheel horses of the party as Chaun
cey M. DoPew nnd Uncle Joe Cannon,
with Senator William K. Borah of the
newer day, thrown in for good men
sure. If tho plans of the 0. O. P. leaders
go through as per the schedule on
which they were arranging things in
tho early afternoon, the session begin
ning at 4 p. m. to which hour the
convention ndjourned nt. will be a
two hour discussion of tho platform. It
was first reported all over the con
vention hall that a scheme was being
fathered by a number of the old guard
to continue the session right through
the afternoon and evening until a can
didate was nominated. Chairman Hard
ling, however, gave it as his opinion
that there would be no nominating
speeches until tomorrow morning,
I Colonel Roosevelt's announcement
from Oyster Ray that he would journey
to Chicago if the republican convention
invited him to do so, did not get a. rise
out or the republicans. The big lenders
read the statement with unconcealed in
terest but none had any comment to
make except Chairman Harding, who
i said that only the convention had the
I authority to invite Eoosevelt to make
an address. '
' Crowds Gather Slowly.
From all outward appearances the
convention was no nourer its choice of
a nominee thi-s afternoon than yester
day. There was, however, n very notice
able increase in pep among the dele
gates in the number of persons in the
galleries and in the spontaneity of the
cheering. And this was despite the fact
that the weather was every bit as cold
and wet and uninspiring ns yesterday.
Today, however, tho convention seem
ed to find itself. It ws like a real old
fashioned republican gathering the
yowls of derision at oratorical pokes
aimed at democracy, plenty of good old
(r. O. P. bombs thrown by good old
fashioned orators and the general set
ting of other years.
At 10:15, three-quarters of an hour
before the convention was scheduled to
start there were not more than 500 peo
ple in the hall. Musiu of the band
echoed and re-echoed through the giant
spaces of the hall and reverberated
against t he bunting draped roof. Out
side, it rained unceasingly. An unend
ing flock of taxicaliB poured out their
stream of delegates and visitors.
Straw Hats and Overcoats.
But the crowds that stepped from
tnxios and street cars was (rood nntur-
ed. Used to being wet, many men had
not even taken the trouble to change
their straw hats. Panamas and rain
coats were almost nn official uniform.
Out of the thousands of visitors there
were probably only a dozen or so who
picked the right entrance by which to
get into the convention but not more
than a dozen. "Quite the nrooer course
, was to find that your entrance was just
a mink away.
There was neither the usual conven
tion jam or the tense feeling engender
ed by the bitter rival candidates to
create bad temper.
At 10:40 there were perhaps 2,000
people in the hall and of these, not 75
were delegates. Saddest of all, the rain
drenched throng were the ticket spec
tators. There was nn awful bearinh
feeling in the ticket market.
Tho Coliseum was lighted inside, ns
for a night session nnd it was entire
ly- necessary too. The band changed
.tactics today and instead of playing
Chopin and other classic, put a little
more pep into things bv swinging off
occasionally into-"good Bye, tiirls,"
"Wearing of the Orcen" and some of
the more lively tunes of the da v.
Uncle Joe's race Enough.
Senator Harding arrived at 11:05,
with his faithful parliamentarian. Rep
resentative W. S. Bennett, of Xew York,
as always duriLg convention time, at
his elbow. One usher had the hardi
hood to stop Uncle Joe Cannon as the
former speaker was meandering down
the aisle toward the space marked off
for the Illinois delegation.
"Where's your badgef" the zealous
gunrdiau demanded.
Un'le Joe stuttered.

Elephant and Moose Would
Build Platform They Could
Stand on Without Crowding
By Perry Arnold.
(United l'ress staff correspondent.)
Chicago, June X No sun iu the heav
ens illumined rain souked Chicago to
day; no sun of political ascendeucy
rose to chase away clouds of doubt
and apprehension.
It was still raining today. A cold
wind and a steady downpour added to
the general morning-after feeling, and
the pneumatic germs stalked across
Cook county like an invading host. Ev
ery downtown bur demonstrated the
popularity of tho idea of preparedness.
But no presidential candidates had been
picked nor even tentatively decided up
on by the republican nntional conven
tion. The organization leaders wero alive
today to the necessity of stirring things
un. The moral effect on delegates of
shouting"iobs, choking all hotel lob
bies, whose unchanging cry of "we
want this or that 'favorite son," was
jnot discounted. Nor was tho fact for
t gotten that whereas yesterday 'b repub
i lican conclave evoked no oemonstra
Ition exceeding ono minute, the progres
sives forgot the weather nnd staged nn
! hour and 31 minute frenzy of e.nthus
iiasm. Even the charge thnt the pro
gressive outburst was conspicuously well
staged and managed did not get away
from the fact thnt it at least went off
j with a yip.
Surface indications continue to show
(Hughes lending as the most likely can
jdidnte but there was an evident slump
in the Hughes boom and it was appal-1
ent that favorite sons were coming in
for consideration that had not been
accorded them earlier.'
Hughes' Silence Apprehensive.
The old guard lenders feel they can-
not afford to nominate Hughes and
ithen have hi in refuse to accept in event
'of Roosevelt accepting the progressive
I laurel. The most desperate attempts
j have been made during the nst 24 hours
to pry something out of Hughes ns to
Whether he would "stay put" if nomi
.nuted. It is known two confidential
envoys of the republican hadei, one a
I very close personal friend of the jus
tice, who consented to attempt the task.
Lave reported their utter failure hero in
Chicago during the last 21 hours.
THEODORE E-BURTON
SOME REPUBLICAN POSSIBILITIES.
As a result of the deadlock, many
new plans were being pushed forward
some ot them containing ideas which
wero regarded as ridiculous 48 hourt
ago. Some of the delegates who were
hearing from home were beginning to
look more favoiatjly on a get together
plan with the progressives with the
hope of staving off a third party ticket,
even at tho cost of having to submit
considerably to the will of Roosevelt.
They realized the candidacy, in sueb
a c-ntingei.cy, would have to be a men
satisfactory to T. R. and it is realized
that there are few such outside of
Oyster Bny.
Tho routine program 'for today's ses
sion was not one conducive on fts face
to uujestrained enthusiasm. The con
vention was to meet at 11 o'clock, tho
committee on credentials wafl to report
its approval of the national committee's
decision on contests and the permanent
roll of delegates was to be m-cpied.
Then the committeo on permanent or
ganization win: to submit its report for
approval, n permanent orgnaization was
to be effect I'd nnd finnlly the report
of the rules committee was to be
adopted. Two hours, at the most,, was.
the probable lengtu ot toe session.
To Consult Our Platform.
The platform builders, in the mean
time, were to get together in final ses
sions and polish the draft approved by
the sub-committee. It was conceded the
platform framcrs had done a neat, job
in Americanizing the republican state
ment of principles. A few attempts to.
insert planks were anticipated but no
general assault wus looked for.
Tho one chance for firewodks at to-
day's session in tho Coliseum was on
the ew Jersey resolution directing a
committee of republicans to confer with
the progressives on a platform on which
there might be n basis for amalgama
tion. The disposition of the republiuan
leaders was to permit passage of this
measure. Tho men whose names have
been mentioned as possibe appointees
thereon were:
Senator Borah, Senator Lodge, Sen
ator Hemingway, Chnirmnn Hilles and
one other not selected. The progrcs-

mined to nominate Theodore Roosevelt
Defore 0 o'clock, George W. Perkins,
conservative leader, prevailed upon
John M. Parker of I.ouisiuna, radical
leader, to postpone the nomination until
tomorrow if possible to control the dele
gates. Parker was to make a speech from

ling mob of delegates to delay tho ac
tion. Parker was slated to have mado
tho nominating speech lato this after
noon. "I believo wo still have a chance to
nominato Roosevelt nt the Coliseum,"
snid Perkins to Parker.
"I doubt it," said Parker in re
turn. "If you nominate him now, you will
kill all chances of Roosevelt republi
cans succeeding in the Coliseum," de
clared Perkins.
"I'll do the best I can," replied
Parker, "but I doubt if I can hold

earnest request."

Chicago, Juno 8 Declaring for a reg
ular army of 250,000 men, a navy sec
ond in tho world in battle efficiency,
and a nationalized system of citizen
military training, supplied and controll
ed by the federal government, the pro
gressive platform as adopted today,
makes preparedness and Americanism
the keynotes of party policy.
.Standing for peace, tho progressives
declare that an adequate militnry estab
lishment for defense, sufficient to
guarantee American rights on land and
sen and to uphold the honor of the na
tion is a bnsic, duty of the government
to the people.
Linked with their declaration for a
stronger military establishment, the
progressives ossert that individual ef
ficiency, a "passing of prosperity
about" nnd a soolnl justico imperative.
Regulation of industry and a non-partisan
tariff commission ore declared es
sential to meet with the mobilized pro
duction of Europe following the war.
The Progressive Platform.
'f This is the venr of dec.ifjnn for the
nation's future." As wo now decide, so
shall we go forward in righteousness
and power or backward in degrada
tion niu. wenkness.
"Of necessity, wo. deal now with the
foundation of our national life. We are
facing elements of force, of right and
wrong, of extremo national peril. Our
I present choice of pnth will be irrevoca
ble, ine tradition of isolation has been
ended. The United States is now a part
of a world system of civilisation. We
stand or full as we prepare to tnk
our parts in peace or war and hold
our own therein,
"As members of an international
community, we are subject to certain
bnsie duties.
"To secure the rights and cquat
treatment of our citizens; native or
naturalized, on land and ru; without
regard to race, creed or nntivity.
"To guard the honor and uphold the
just influence of our nation; to main
tain the integrity of international law.
"These are the cornerstones of civil
ization. Wo must be strong to defend
them. Tho present war shows that it
is supremo duty of civilizntion to
create conditions which will innke peace
pcrmnnent. Our country must be able
and rendy to take up part in that work.
Tho peace wo desire for onr country
is not the pence of sulimisiun and cow
ardice, but the pence of justice. War
nnd its evils will not bo done away with
by a suffrage injustice to ourselves or
others, nor by pledging ourselves to
drastic action for international rights,
if we do not preparo the ioreo which
would sustain such nction. We enn
perform our rightful part in promotiujj
