Butte, Neb., Gazette: About ten
days ago, in fact on Monday, May
15, L. H. Dierking missed his white
faced bull, and as it was a valuable
animal, he has made thorough search
with no result. Wednesday evening
he had given it up, and was just
ready to go to bed when he happen
ed to think of an old shed near the
river which had been used as a sort
of bath house. He remembered
that he had not looked in this shed,
and further remembered that he
had opened the door some time ago,
and on Wednesday afternoon he no
ticed the door being shut. The two
facts finally impressed themselves so
strongly that he decided to investi
gate at once. Taking a lantern he
went down and found the door shut
and fastened. After considerable
effort, he got it open and there sure
enough wast the bull, somewhat
gaunt and very thirsty, but other
wise apparently all right. He ran
out of the shed and into the brush
and Mr. Dierking concluded to let
him take care of himself and went
home. Next morning the bull was
at the barn, little the worse for his
adventure. The animal had gone
into the shed, and probably struck
the prop which held the door open,
letting it blow shut, then, in an ef
fort to get out had wedged a piece
of wood on the inside in such a way
that he could not push the door
open. He was in the shed tep full
days without feed or water.
Sioux City Journal, 5th: Reports
from St. Paul that officials of the
Great Northern road and of the Bur
lington system were considering
plans for the erection of a new rail
road bridge over the Missouri river
at Sioux City, are not taken serious
ly by local officials of the companies.
The announcement, which was sup
posed to come from one of the heads
of the construction department of
the Great Northern road, received
brief mention in St. Paul papers.
The new structure, according to the
St. Paul statement, will span the
river just below the high bridge,
which is owned by the Norhwestern
line. Its construction would entail
the expenditure of several million
dollars. The construction of the
bridge is said to be included in a
plan of the Great Northern and Bur
lington to establish all of their ter
minals in the east end of the city.
At present the Great Northern is in-
Dakota City, Nebr.

stalling new shops in the Floyd val
ley. The construction of the new
bridge and the removal of the ter
minals to the east end is to be done
in order to make the shops easier of
access, according to the St. Paul re
port. It has been generally expect
ed in railroad circles that the Great
Northern and Burlington eventually
will purchase the combination bridge,
which is to be sold at public auction.
The Burlington formerly entered
Sioux City from Nebraska over the
bridge, but for some fears this line
has been using the "high" bridge.
J. L. Kenedy, general attorney for
the Great Northern road, said he
did not believe that the company at
present is giving serious considera
tion to a change in terminals in
Sioux City or to the construction of
a new bridge over the Missouri
river.

Sioux City Journal, 3rd: Answers
to the complaint of South Sioux City
residents that the street car fares
between Sioux City and South Sioux
City are excessive have been filed
with the interstate com
merce commission by the Combina
tion Bridge company, the Sioux City
Service company and the South Sioux
City Traction company. Former
Councilman Fred Martin, of South
Sioux City, who is responsible for
the opening of the case, has received
word from Washington that a hear
ing will be ordered by the commis
sion in the pear future. The three
corporations will resist any attempt
toward lowering the present passen
ger rates. This is indicated in the
answers now in the hands of the
commissioners. The Combination
Bridge company rests its main con
tention on the assertion that it is
not a common carrier of passengers,
and, in consequence, is not subject
to the jurisdiction of the interstate
commerce commission. The compa
ny contends the commission has no
authority to pass on what rates are
fixed as bridge tolls'. This conten
tion of the bridge company is not a
new one. For years it has filed
with the commerce commission its
annual report under protest. The
question never has been settled.
The hearing in the case brought by
the South Sioux City people will dis
pose of the matter. The Service
company and the South Sioux City
Traction company in their answers
point out that a fare of but 5 cents
is charged passengers to and from
South Sioux City, with transfers
given to and from all lines in Sioux
City. The amount above 5 cents,
the two companies assert, goes as
toll to the Combination Bridge com
pany. In the original complaint
filed with the commerce commission
from South Sioux City, it was stated
that the fare was too high and cited
the passenger tariff between Council
Bluffs and Omaha as a reasonable
one. At the present time it costs 10
cents to come from South Sioux
City to Sioux City. There is a small
saving when book tickets are pur
chased from the bridge company,
the South Sioux City people will be
satisfied if a rate is established mak
ing the round trip cost 15 cents.
