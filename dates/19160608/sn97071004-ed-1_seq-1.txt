BRITISH CLAIM GERMANY'S LOSS
IN NAVAL flGttr WAS HEAVIER
London The British admiralty Mon
day issued a statement saying there
was the strongest ground for the be
lief that the British navy in the bat
tle with the Germans off Jutland last
week hud accounted for a total of 18
German men-of-war, and that there
wss nothing to add to or substract
from the original announcement of the
British losses.
The statement gave the German
losses as two batttlexhips, two dread
naught battle , cruisers, four light
cruisers, nine torpedo boat destroyers
and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed as a
result of the admiraltiy's original
statement of losses, which is consid
ered to have been needlessly candid
and conservative in underestimating
the extent of the German losses, as
compared with those of Great Britain,
has been greatly lessened by the latest
statement.
A dispatch from Copenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
two additional German warships be
sides those announced in the German
communication the battleship West-
falen and the battle cruiser Lutzowd
were sunk In battle. A wireless dis
patch received here Saturday from
Berlin suid the German admiralty ad'
milted the loss of the WestTalen.
The admiralty statement declares
that the German losses in the fight
were not only relatively, but absolute
ly, greater than those of the British.
Maintaining its practice of caution,
the admiralty still refrains from giv
ing the names of the lost German
shins.
The official list of the casualties
among officers shows that hardly a
single officer of the line escaped from
the British cruisers sunk in the battle,
An additional casualty list of petty
officers shows that 43 of them were
saved from the Queen Mary, Invinci
ble, Fortune, Ardent and Shark. lone
was saved from the Indefstigible, De
fense, Black Prince, Tipperary, Turbu
lent. Nomad or Nestor.
Great Oriental freight Cargo .
and Saa Francisco Pier Bum
San Francisco Five thousand tons
of frieght from the Orient, which
were unloaded Sunday from the bhin
yo Mara No. 2, a Japanese freighter,
and a concrete pier recently erected by
the state at the mouth of Islais Creek,
were destroyed in a spectacular blaze
of unknown origin here early Monday.
The Shinyo and the General Forbes,
another freighter, which were tied to
the pier, were slightly damaged before
they could be removed from the fire's
reach. Steamship men said the loss
would reach close to $800,000.
The Shinyo arrived Wednesday, but
the cargo was not touched until Sun
day, when its owners granted the de
mands of the striking longshoremen.
The boat was emptied at 11 o'clock
Sunday night, three hours before the
fire started.
Two coal barges and several box
cars were also damaged. One of the
barges, the Melrose, the largest on the
bay, which was tied to the pier, drift
ed out into the stream with her cargo
ablaze when her moorings burned. She
bumped another coal barge, which was
anchored off the pier. Both burned
freely until fire tugs flooded the coal.
Later the two broke loose and drifted
down the bay with their cargoes
smouldering. Tugs caught up with
them off the Ferry building.
Several narrowly escaped being
burned. Customs Lieutenant Patrick
Barrett and a pier watchman were on
the pier when the fire started. " The
flames spread rapidly and drove the
two men aboard the Forbes.
When the Are broke out, Japanese
swarmed from the Shinyo's forecastle
and spread over the ship, seeking ref
uge. One jumped overboard, but his
mates hauled him back on a life pre
server. ,
From nearby cities and from far out
at sea the sheets of fire and the glare
could be seen. The blaze was the
most spectacular and destructive that
has visited the local waterfont in
years.
Ice Sweeps Alaska Town.
Nome, Alaska Council City was al
most completely swept away by float
ing ice cakes from .the Neukluk river
late Sunday. Many buildings in the
lower part of the town were demol
ished. The ice jammed in a canyon a
short distance below the settlement,
causing the water to back up, and, with
its burden of heavy ice, to flood the
streets.- A blizzard raged here also,
and sluicing operations which began a
few days Bgo, were suspended.
- Marines Are Reinforced.

James 1. Hill's Wealth Esti
mated in Hundred Millions
St. Paul The wealth of the late
James J. Hill, who died Monday, is
estimated all the way from $100,000,-
000 to $500,000,000. He was worth
probably between $200,000,000 and
$250,000,000.
An estimate of Mr. Hill's wealth
was furnished when, at the opening of
the European war, he called his bank
ers together and displayed a mass of
his securities. More than . $100, 000,
000 was said to have been in the boxes
he laid before his bankers.
"There should be no trouble," said
Mr. Hill, "but if there is, this amount
is at your disposal."
The First National bank then bor
rowed from Mr. Hill $10,000,000
worth of Great Northern railroad
bonds. These were placed with the
Treasury department in Washington,
and $6,000,000 worth of emergency
currency, allowed under the Aldrich
act, was shipped at once to the First
National bank. It was found neces
sary to place only $125,000 worth of
this in circulation. In a few weeks
the entire amount was returned to
Washington.
Mr. Hill had the absolute control of
the First National bank and the North
western Trust company, which gave
a combined capital and surplus of $6,
500,000. . ,
He was a large owner- of stock in
the Chase National bank of New York,
First National bank Chicago, and the
Northwestern Natoinal bank in Minne
apolis. He was a large owner of the
Great Northern Steamship company.
The greatest portion of Mr. Hill s
wealth, however, was in stocks and
bonds of the Great Northern, North
ern Pacific and Chicago, Burlington &
Quincy railroads.

PRESIDENT INSISTS ON FULL AL
LEGIANCE IN MEMORIAL DAY TALK
Washington, D. C President Wilson
delivered a Memorial Day address here
Tuesday, in which he defined the spirit
of America, warned citizens of foreign
birth not to set themselves against the
purposes of the nation, called upon
young men to perform voluntary mili
tary service and defended his recent
suggestion for an alliance of nations to
preserve peace. He spoke at Arling
ton National Cemetery before an au
dience made up largely of I Civil War
veterans, who applauded him vigorous'
While he declared he had no harsh
ness in his ' heart for Americans of
foreign birth and expected them still
to love the sources of their origin, the
President said "America must come
first in every purpose we entertain and
every man must count upon being cast
out of our confidence, cast out even of
our tolerance, who does not submit to
that great ruling principle."
Speaking of America, made up out
of all the peoples of the world, as the
champion of the rights of mankind, he
said:'
"We are not only ready to co-operate,
but we are ready to fight against
any aggression, whether .from within
or without. But we must guard our
selves against any sort of aggression
which would be unworthy of America.
We are ready to fight for our rights
when these rights are coincident with
the rights of man and humanity."
s The President reiterated his sugges
tion before the League to Enforce
Peace last week that the United States
was ready to become a partner in any
alliance of the hations "which would
guarantee public right against selfish
aggression. Of published criticisms
reminding him that George Washing
ton warned the nation against "en
tangling alliances," he said: ,
"L shall never myself consent to an
entangling alliance, but would gladly
consent to a disentangling alliance, an
alliance which would disentangle the
peoples of the world from those com
binations in which they seek theif own
separate and private interests and
unite the people of the world to pre
serve the peace of the world upon a
basis of common right and justice."

Secretary Classifies Lands in
Whitman National Forest
Portland Announcement is made by
the district forester, George H. Cecil,
Portland, Ore., of the classification,
by the secretary of Agriculture, of
practically all the lands within the
boundaries of the Whitman national
forest in north eastern Oregon. A net
area of approximately 879,218 acres Is
embraced in this classification, and a
small area of 2742 acres is left for ex
amination later.
The Whitman national forest lies in
the Blue mountains, and, according to
the report, consists mainly of a large
body of positive forest land. The re
port shows that there is a stand of
about four billion feet of valuable com
mercial timber within the forest, fifty
per cent of which is western yellow
pine. There is also a considerable
stand of young timber and inferior
species which has a high value for wa
tershed protection for ' the streams
which are uesd for irrigation outside
the national forest.
This forest, it is said, has little ag
ricultural value, and isolated, scattered
tracts only could be used for farm pur
poses. The soil, although fertile, is
rocky and shallow, and although rec
ords are meager, the rainfall is known
to vary from 10 to 40 inches, the snow
fall from 20 inches to 30 feet in the
higher altitudes the snow comes as
late as mid-June or as early as the
last of August; the killing frosts oc
cur every month in the year. The
temperature is also known to vary
from 30 degrees below zero to 120
above. Practically the entire forest
is at elevations from 4000 to 10,000
feet. The topography is rough, char
acterized by deep, precititoua canyons,
and jagged peaks. Although over 70,
000 acres of alienated land exist with
in the forest boundaries, taken op un
der the homestead and timber and
stone acts, it is claimed that most at
tempts at agriculture have proven fail
urea, and a large per cent of the pri
vate lands have eihter been abandoned
or are being held for their timber and
grazing value.
In view, therefore, of these circum
stances, and with the exception of
small isolated tracts, aggregating 2742
acres left for later examination, the
secretary has classified the entire area
of the Whitman national forest as
chiefly valuable for forest purposes
and not suited to agriculture or list-
able under the act of June 11, 1906.
27-Year Wait Is Rewarded.
Marahfield George W. Suydam,
who has a secret preparation for pre
serving woods, waited 27 long years
before realizing on his knowledge of
chemicals. Nearly 30 years ago Mr.
Suydam, who is a resident of Den
mark, Curry county, prepared with his
process a number of different woods
and placed them away with woods of
the same variety to see what time
would do with each of his keepsakes.
Now that the woods have been ex
amined and passed upon by experts, it
is found that those which were treated
27 years ago are as well preserved as
when they were put away, while the
wood which was not treated has rotted
away and decayed.
L. E. Swan, of Detroit, Mich., hear
ing of the successful preservative, came
to Curry county and, after an investi
gation, purchased a half interest in
the secret process and will finance its
exploitation. ... , .

GERMANS VICTORS
IN BIG SEA FIGHT
fourteen British, Nine German Ships
Admitted to Have Been Sunk.
GREATEST BATTLE IN HISfORY
All-Night Engagement in North Sea
Greatly Aided by Zeppelins
. Casualties Reported High.
London Picking its way from its
base in the Kiel Canal the German
high-sea fleet Wednesday afternoon
emerged into the North Sea, and, off
the coast of Jutland, engaged a British
fleet throughout the afternoon and
night in what probably was the great
est naval battle in the world's history
so far as tonnage engaged and tonnage
destroyed was concerned.
When the battle ended Great Britain
had lost the battle cruisers Queen
Mary, Indefatigable and Invincible,
the cruisers Defence, Black Prince and
Warrior and eight torpedo boat de
stroyers. The German battleship Pommern
was sent to the bottom by a torpedo
and the cruiser Wiesbaden sunk by the
British gunfire. In addition several
German torpedo craft are missing and
the small cruiser Frauenlob was seen
badly listing and waa believed to have
gone to the bottom. '
These losses have all been admitted
by Great Britain and Germany.
' Aside from Great Britain's conceded
losses. Germany says that the British
battleship Warsprite, sister ship of
the Queen Elizabeth, and one of the
largest and most powerful ships afloat,
had been sunk; that the battleship
Marlborongh, a vessel of 25,000 tons,
had been hit by a torpedo, and a sub
marine had been destroyed.
Great Britain also added to Ger
many's acknowledged losses with the
claim that one dreadnaught of the Ger
mna Kaiser class vessels of 24,700
tons and carrying a complement of
1088 men had been attacked and de
stroyed by British torpedo craft; that
another battleship of the same class
was believed to have been sunk by
gunfire; that one battle cruiser had
been blown up and two others damaged
and that six destroyers and a subma
rine also had been sent to the bottom.
Great Britain's admitted loss in ton
nage was 114,810 for six battle cruis
ers and cruisers. That of Germany,
excluding the tonnage of the Wiesba
den, of which vessel there is no rec
ord, was 15,172. . s '.-.
That the casualties in the fighting
off Jutland were heavy is indicated by
the fact that of the crew of some 900
on board the Indefatigable only two
men are known to have been saved.
Six . Zeppelins participated in the
naval engagement, according to a dis-
patch from Copenhagen to the Daily
Mail. One of the dirigibles, the L-24,
was hit several times and badly dam
aged, the report says, but she, was able
to reach the Schleswig coast. Several .
of her men were wounded, and all of
her supplies had to- be thrown over
board. The scene of the battle was in the
Eastern waters of the North Sea. It
is probable that the German fleet was
on one of the excursions into the North
Sea, which it has taken from time to
time during the war, and met, whether
or not by design, with the British
fleet.
Skager-Rak is an arm of the North
Sea between Norway and Denmark.
The point referred to in the official
German statement as Horn Riff prob
ably is the reef off the Horn, on the ,
southwestern extremity - of Denmark
This would indicate that the battle
was fought off the coast of Denmark.
From the reef to Helgoland, the main
Germah naval base in the North Sea,
is about 100 miles.
A dispatch from Copenhagen de
clares it is generally stated in Berlin
that the activity of the German fleet
was due to the energetic demands of
Emperor William to his brother, Ad
miral Prince Henry of Prussia, commander-in-chief
of the navy, and Ad
miral von Capelle, minister of the
navy, on the emperor's visit last week
to Wilhelmshaven. .
Battle Aid to Peace.
Washington, D. C. Reports of the
naval engagement in the North Sea
aroused the greatest interest here, not
only in naval circles, but at the vari
ous belligerent embassies and among
administration officials. : It was freely,
predicted that if the German fleet
demonstrated a real superiority, ship
for ship, the effects on the prospects
for peace would be considerable.
' The particulars received here were
inadequate as a basis for judgment.
