MEMBERS OF CO, 6 TO BET
SALARIES STARTING JUlY 1
Bogalusa has always teen proud
of Co. G. L. N. G. and they will be
pleased to know that effective about
July 1, every member of the com
pany will receive a salary as a re
sult of the bill which just passed
Congress. The members will re
ceive 25 per cent of the salary given
members of the U. S. Army. This
means that the privates in Co. G.
will receive about $5 per month,
Sargeant $7.50 per month, Second
Lieut. $20. per month, Lieut. $25
per month and Captain will receive
about $500 a year. There are 83
privates and officers in the local
company; and the fact that their
importance is recognized by the U.
S. government will result in many
joining the militia.
Bogalusa has an excellent oppor
tunity of securing another company
as only 63 privates and 3 officers
are required as a minimum. Pre
paredness is now the national slogan
and every man who has studied the
situation, appreciates the necessity
of having a larger and better mili
tia. With the number of young
able bodied men in Bogalusa another
company could be organized after
a determined campaign,
