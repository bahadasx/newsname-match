Mrs. R E. Steele
It becomes the writer's sad duty to
chronicle the death of Mrs. GeorgiaAnn
Miller Steele, which occurred at her
home May 17. Mrs. Steele had been
suffering from a severe strolie of par
alysis since Sept. 18, 1913, which had
rendered her an invalid for almost three
years. She bore her suffering with
Christian fortitude, always willing that
"the Lord's will be done." She was
attended by a number of our best phy
sicians, but this dreadful disease could
not be managed.
Mrs. Steele was born March 1, 1846.
She joined the Presbyterian church in
her early womanhood. She lived a con
sistent member of same until her death.
Mrs. Steele was very enthusiastic in
Sunday school and missionary work.
She had a gentle disposition; to know
her was to love her. She was ever
mindful to entertain strangers. We
thank God for the lives of such noble
women.
Sister Steele, we 1i snrely miss thee
In our circles here below;
But the thought of a heavenly meeting
Is the sweetest thought to know.
She was married to Capt. R. E. Steele
April 27, 1869. To this marriage was
born three daughters, namely: Emily
and Emma Love, who died when very
young, and Miss Rosa, who died at the
age of 17. (So mother and daughters
are united just over the river.) There
was also born to Mr. and Mrs. Steele
five sons, who survive her, with their
father. The sons are: Messrs. J. E. M.,
C. M. and J. F., Pickens; J. E. Steele,
Indianapolis, Ind., and Dr. W. H. Steele,
Jackson, Ga. No mother could boast of
five more loyal sons. Mr. J. F., the
youngest son, patiently answered her
every call during the days of her in
validism and cared for her tenderly as
she cared for him in infancy.
By her request funeral services were
conducted by Rev. B. F. Murphree, as
sisted by her pastor, Rev. Wallis. Amid
a large concourse of sorrowing relatives
and friends the remains were laid to rest
in Keowee cemetery beside her mother
and her three daughters.
We would commend the grief-stricken
ohes to the Omniscious One who worketh
all things for good to them that love
Him. It is a sweet consolation to know
that "the Lord loveth whom he chas
teneth."
"I shine in the light of God;
'His image stamps my brow.
Thru the shadow of death my feet have
trod
I reign in glory now.
"I have found the joys of heaven;
I am one of the angel band.
To my head a crown of gold is given;
A harp is in my hand.
I have learned the songs they sing
Whom Jesus hath set free.
"No sins, no grief, no pain
Safe in my happy home;
My fears all fled, my foes all slain,
My hour of triumph come.
*Then why should your tears run down,
Or your hearts he sorely riven?
For another gem in the Savior's crown,
And another soul in Heaven."
A FRIEND.

Court in Ses
Court convened Monday morb t
Judge T. J. Mauldin presldfhg,
court officials were in their places d
the court Immediately got down to'bus
iness.
The following cases have been dis 'NTi
ad of up until Tuesday night: -
The State vs Ollie Farmer, assa,
and battery, two years or $400.
The State vs Jim Morrison and Bet

plead guilty, six months.
The State vs Wade Dodgins, viola
tion dispensary law, plead guilty, three
months or $100. Upon payment of $25
or serving one month balanne of sen
tence suspended during good behavior,'
A pathetic sce'ne occuried in the court
room Monday afternoon. Three young
boys, Hooper, Smith. and Rice, aged 14,
15 and 151 years, had plead guilty to a
charge of house-breaking and grand
larceny, having broken into a store and
stolen $35 worth of goods at the VEasley.$
mill. The solicitor asked that the judge
be lenient with the boys on account of
their youth. The presidingjudge told
them he was sorry for them and gave,
them some good advice, but it was his
duty to pass sentence upon them for
their offenses. And it was fourteen
months in the state reformatory for
boys. There was a silence. Then came
the pathetic part. Mothers of two of
the boys came up with tear-filled eyes
to the prisoner's dock where the boys
were and talked to them and caressed
them; then after a few minutes the
mothers went out of the court room
bowed in grief. Boys, think of your
silvery-haired mothers when you start
to do wrong.
It is probable that court will adjourn
about Wednesday.
