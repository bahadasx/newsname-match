CHICAGO, June 8.—The republican
platform to be adopted by the natiou
al convention today, in addition to
taking a strong stand for out and out
"Americanism" will declare for a
navy which will fear no other power
In the world and for a standing armv
of sufficient size to form the nucleus
of an effective mobile force in case
of war.
The question of woman's suffrage
had- not been disposed of early today.
This plank is to be laid before the
entire resolutions committee before
final decision is made.
No prohibition plank will be In
cluded in the platform.
A new proposal for the federal
government to take over complete
regulation of transportation, thereby
supplanting the numerous state rail
way and service cominlssions in their
control over railroads is recommend
ed by the sub committee over which
Chairman Lodge presided, and may. be
adopted.
The United Press learned on the
highest authority today that the
planks of the platform are substan
tially as follows:
Preparedness.
The platform declares for both mil
itary and industrial preparedness a
larger navy that will be able to pro
tect America's interests anywhere
throughout the world, and a standing
army sufflcientely large not only to
protect our borders, but in case of
war to form a strong nucleus for na
tional defense the state militias to
be encouraged in the training of a
citizen soldiery. (No federation of
militia no mention of compulsory
military service.) Closer co-operation
between the government and Ameri
can industries so they can be used
tat the nation's defense In time of war.

CHICAGO, June 8.—No son In the

It was rilll raining today.• A cold
wind and a steady downpour added
to the general morning-after feeling
and the j.tieumonia germ stalked
across Cook, county like an invading
host. Kvory down-town bar demon
strated the popularity of the idea of
preparedness. But no presidential
nominee had been picked nor even
tentatively decided upon by the repub-
today to the necessity of stirring
things up. The morale effect on dele
gates of shouting mobs choking all
hotel lobbies whose unchanging cry of
"we want this or that favorite son"
was not discounted. Nor was the fact
that whereas yesterday's republican
conclave evoked no demonstration ex
ceeding one minute, the progressive
forgot the weather and staged an
hour and thirty-four minuto frenry
of enthusiasm. Even thtf charge that
the progressive outburst was sus

event of Roosevelt's accepting the
progressive laurel. The naost desper

the. last twenty-four hours to pry
something out of Hughes as to
whether he would "stay put" if nomi
nated. It is known two confidential
envoys of the republican leaders, one
a very close personal friend of the
justice, who consented to attempt the
task, have reported their utter failure
here in Chicago during the last twen

As a result of the deadlock, manr
new plans were being pushed forward

were regarded as ridiculous forty

progressives, with the hope of stav

the cost of having to submit to the
will of Roosevelt. They realized the
candidate in such a contingency,
would have to be a man satisfactory
to T. R., and it is realized that there
are few such—outside of Oyster Bay.
The routine program for today's
session was not one conducive on its
face, to unrestrained enthusiasm. The
convention was to meet at 11 o'colck
the committee on credentials was to
report its approval of the national
committee's decisions on contests and
the permanent roll of delegates was to
be accepted. Then the committee on
permanent organization was to sub

at the most, was the probable length
of the session.

The one chance for fireworks at to

the New Jersey delegate's reso'uiion

to permit passage of this measure.
The men whose names have been
mentioned as possible appointees

onel Roosevelt replied today as fol
lows to William P. Jackson, of Mary
land, who invited him to address the
national republican convention: "In
answer to your telegram, I can only
say that the matter lies with the re
publican convention and that if the
convention desires me to address it, 1
shall be glad to do so. I very earnest
ly hope republicans and progressives
assembled at Chicago will keep
steadily in mind the gravity of this
crisis, not only for America but for
the world and the need that their ac
tion in dignity, foresight and patriot
ism shall rise to the level of the crisis.
I hope that the aim will be not mere
ly to nominate a man who can be
elected next November, but a man of
such power, character, steadfast con
viction and proved ability that if elect
ed he will again place this nation
where it belongs by making it true
to itself and therefore true to all
mankind.
"President Wilson,, however, ami
able his intentions, has rendered to
this people the most evil service that
can be rendered to a great democ
racy by its chosen leader. He has
dulled the national conscience and re
laxed the spring of lofty, national
motives, by teaching our people to
accept high sounding words as tho
offset and atonement for shabby
deeds, and to use words which mean
nothing in order to draw all meaning
from those' which have a meaning. It
will be no easy task to arouse the
austere self-respect which has been
lulled to slumber by these means. To
this task we should bend our united
energy, in the spirit of Washington
and Lincoln, the spirit of genuine
democratic leadership, thfe spirit
which sets the standard to which the
nation ought to rise and then with
confident hope appeal to the soul of
the people so that they may in fact
support the standard thus raised.
"The differences that have divided,
not merely republicans and progres
sives but good Americans of all
shades of political beliefs, from cno
another, in the past, sink into noth
ing when compared with the issues
now demanding decision—for these
issues are vital to the national life—
they are issues of unified American
ism and of national preparedness. If
we are not all of us Americans and
nothing else, scorning to divide along
the lines section, creed or of national
origin, then the nation ifself will
crumble into dust.
"If We are not thoroughly prepared,
if we have net developed a strength
which respects the rights of others
but which is ready to enofrce from
others respect for its own rights, then
sooner or, later we shall have to sub
mit to tile will of an alien conquer
or.
"These questions are not In the
realm of abstract thought. They
must be taken out of the world of
cloudy promise and vague phrasing
into the world of performances and
fact. They are today in concrete
jform before you and your fellows for
your decision. For two years, in the
face of an awful world cataclysm, this
nation has stood supine and helpless
and has not in the smallest degree
prepared itself to ward off the danger*
No promise, no excuse now made by

worth consideration. It is for you and

the United States but of Germany,
and of that section of the German
vote, which is anti-American to the

by the federal government, the pro
gressive platform, to be adopted to
day makes preparedness and Ameri
canism the keynotes of party policy.
Standing for peace, the progressives
declare that an adequate military es
tablishment for defense, sufficient to
guarantee American rights on land
and sea and to uphold the honor of
tfie nation, is a basic duty of the gov
ernment to the people.
Linked with their declaration for a
strong military establishment, the
progressives assert that industrial
efficiency, passing prosperity and so

industry and a nonpartisan tariff
commission are declared to be essen

duction of Europe following the war.
The Platform.
The platform follows:
"This the year for decision for
the nation's future. As we now de
cide, so shall we go forward in
righteousness and power or backward
In degredation and weakness.
"Of necessity we deal now with the
following of our national life: We are
facing elements of force of right and
wrong, of national peril. Our present
choice of path will be irrevocable. The
tradition of isolation has been ended.
The United States is now a part of a
world Bystem of civilization. Wo
stand or fall as we prepare to take
our parts in peace or war and hold
our own therein.
"As members of an International
community, we are subject to certain
basic duties.
"To secure the rights and equal
treatment of our citizens native or
naturalized, on land and sea without
regard to race, creed or nativity.
To guard the honor and uphold the
just influence of our nation to main
tain the integrity of International
law.
Civilization's Corner Stones.
"Those are the corner stones of
civilization. We must be strong to
defend them. T'ne preesnt war shows
that It is the supreme duty of civiliza
tion to create conditions which will
make peace permanent. Our country
must be able and ready to tafce our
part In that work. Tbo peace which
we desire for our country is not tho
peace of submission aUu cowardice,
