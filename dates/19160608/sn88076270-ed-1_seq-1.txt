OFMIKS TWICE
DEFEATMAGKIARS
WAS BIG COMIC FEATURE OF
THE SEASON—FIRST GAME
7—8 SECOND GAME 5-6.
The Opportunes were owls Satur
day night—and didn't do much until
After 8:45 when they grabbed the
game under cover of darkness. It was
a great surprise for the Magicians
as they had the game won—almost,
having added three runs to their
credit in the first of the ninth. And
it looked as though they had the
game pegged by at least three points.
But as Maurice Katten says, "you
never can tell" and those unloyal spec
tators who left at this juncture miss
ed the best part of the game. Those
who "didn't give up the ship" had the
pleasure of seeing the Opportunes
live up to their name and romp home
with the bacon by marking four scores
in the last four minutes of playing.
At the start-off there wasn't much
excitement anywhere—in fact it was
so still you could hear the ump's
Ingersoll. Things dragged along and
by and by Williston scored three times
in the third. Then the Mags got ex
cited and rapped out a score in each
the fourth and fifth, the home boys
took a number in the sixth, and Mi
not hung up two more in the seventh,
which tied up the score and when the
visitors got in three more runs in the
first of the ninth a good many of
the fans said "good night." But the
game wasn't over. Not yet.
There were several B. H. plays on
both sides, and in fact at one time it
looked like it would be nine-reels of
C. Chaplin stuff, but the finish was
such a happy disappointment that the
rest was forgiven whether forgotten
or not. Rush starred for Minot. A
peep at the box discloses:

DELEGATES LEAVE FOR
FIREMEN'S CONVENTION
Monday morning the delegates from
the local firemen's organization left
to take part in the state convention
to be held at Fargo this week. The
delegation consisted of the following:
F. H. Smith, Chief
C. F. Anderson, assistant chief
W. L. McCrory
E. Rickard
Tom Woodhams
H. Hentjes
E. Bennett
The convention dates are June 6, 7,

men of North Dakota cities are ex
pected to attend the annual conven
tion of the North Dakota Firemen's
association. It will be the twenty
third annual convention and tourna
ment. Secretary H. L. Reade promises
some real oldtime sport for the people
of Fargo when the big event is staged.
The parade takes place on the sec
ond day during the afternoon, while
on the third day the tournament will
be the chief event. There are a num
ber of liberal cash prizes offered in
this contest.
RESULTS OF SCHOOL ELECTION
Tuesday's school election did not
bring out many voters, probably due
partially to inclement weather. The
result on the vote for board member
was:
E. A. Palmer 160
Mrs. S. M. Hydle 188
Total vote cast 348
Mrs. Hydle was elected by 28 ma
jority. The vote was rather light as
compared with regular city elections,
as the male vote is usually in excess
of 500 while at this election both men
and women voted and only 348 ballots
cast.
The proposition for a 10-mill addi
tional levy carried about four to one.
This additional levy is to be used, in
addition to the bonds issued, for the
construction of the new wing to
the high school building, which is now
under way.
HUGE ENGINE TOPPLES
OVER IN LOCAL YARDS
Last Thursday afternoon a huge
engine, tender and two flat cars top
pled over near the ice houses at the
west end of the yards, and it took a
large crew of men and the wrecking
outfit all day Friday to get the roll
ing stock back onto the track. The
engine was of course damaged to con
siderable extent.
The accident was caused by the giv
ing away of the filling where the new
sidings are being put in. The engine
crew escaped injury by jumping when
the engine started to tip.
GREAT NORTHERN TRAIN
WRECKED BY AVALANCHE
Passenger train No. 4, due in Wil
liston at 2:45 Sunday morning, was
wrecked by an avalanche of rock at
Katka, Idaho, a small town 11 miles
east of Bonner's Ferry, Saturday. The
engineer and firemen were killed. The
engine was hurled from the track and
sank in 90 feet of water. The mail
car was knocekd from the track but
stood almost on end at the edge of
the river, but none of the other cars
were derailed, according to reports,
and the passengers did not learn of
the accident for some time after it
happened. A press report states that
it is believed that the engineer realized
the danger and tried to stop his
train. He succeeded in bringing it to
a stop, but not until after the engine
had been struck.
The porters knew little about the
accident but the conductor gave the
following account:
"I was coming between the sleep
ing and observation apartments when
I was suddenly hurled to the door,
my head striking it with such force
that a deep cut resulted. The train
came to a sudden stop and we rushed
to the doors and were in time to see
the engine sink out of sight and to
see the mail car on its end at the
edge of the river. The mail clerk
was rescued from the car and sus
tained but light injuries. Those who
were in their berths in the sleeping
cars knew nothing of the accident till
later when they were awakened."
THIRD ANNUAL CORN AND
ALFALFA PICNIC JULY 14
Plans are being perfected for the
third annual Williams County Corn
and Alfalfa Picnic which will be held
at the experiment station, Friday July
14. Further information regarding
this event will appear in these col
umns from time to time.

VICES AT THE HOME OF
DEAD FINANCIER
St. Paul, May 31.—It is estimated
that more than 50,000 people lined the
streets to witness the funeral cortege
of James J. Hill pass from the Sum
mit avenue residence out of the City
to the burial place at North Oakes
farm. The services at the residence
at 2 o'clock were conducted by Rev.
Thomas Gibbons of the Cathedral.
From 2 to 2:05 o'clock this after
noon the Great Northern railway
paused as a silent token to the mem
ory of its builder, whose funeral
services were opened at that time at
his Summit avenue home in St. Paul.
Not a wheel turned, not a man moved,
nor an order was sent or received. The
scene in some of the offices and shops
in this city were rather affecting. Men
who have been long in the service of
the company, on the stroke of 2
o'clock quit work and stood with un
covered heads and many with tear
dimmed eyes while the silent moments
of tribute were ticked off.
At Williston as elsewhere along the
line, the funeral was observed by sus
pension of all business from 2 to 2:05
o'clock p. m.
WILLISTON HORSES IN MONEY
R. F. Hawley writes from Rouleau,
Sask., where he entered his horses in
a track meet last week, that his ani
mals were both firsts in the races
there, taking »three straight heats
apiece. The ime was not fast as the
track was heavy, 2:17 1-4 being the
best time made.
Axeybetta won the free for all pace
and Sir Archibald the 2:30 pace.
Axeybetta holds the Canadian record,
and Mr. Hawley believes that this
horse will be able to make the mile
in 2:09 in July at the great Brandon
race course.
A DOUBLE WEDDING
A double wedding took place at the
Congregational manse Wednesday
when Dr. James Hoffman Batten per
formed the ceremonies uniting in mar
riage William George Mengel and
George Mengel and Clara Wilhelmina
Busch both of Williston, and Carl
Julian Stenson of Williston and Alma

The Brides are sisters. Both couples
will reside at 809 Second avenue west.
KUCHHI MID STIFF
DE11 WRECKEDSHIP
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF BRIT
ISH LAND FORCES DROWNED
ON WAY TO RUSSIA
London, June 6.—Great Britain is
mourning the loss of her most noted
military chieftain, Field Marshal Earl
Kitchener, head of the British war
office.
Admiral Jellicoe, reporting the sink
ing says the vessel was sent to the
bottom "either by a mine or torpedo."
Supposedly Kitchener and his staff
intended to consult the Russian mili
tary authorities regarding the Rus
sian offensive expected to relieve the
Teutonic pressure on Verdun and the
Italian front.
Jellicoe Reports Disaster
London, June 6.—Admiral Jellicoe,
commander of the British grand fleet,
has reported to the admiralty that the
British cruiser "Hampshire," with
Earl Kitchener and his staff aboard,
has been lost off the west Orkneys.
Four boats were seen to leave the
Hampshire, but a heavy sea was run
ning. Only one capsized boat and
some obdies were found. Kitchener
was on his way to Russia. Admiral
Jellicoe reports that there is little
hope that there are any survivors.
Jellicoe's report to the admiralty
follows:
"I report with deep regret that his
majesty's ship the Hampshire, Cap
tain Herbert J. Saville, R. N., with
Lord Kitchener and his staff aboard,
was sunk last night about 8 o'clock
to the west of the Orkneys, either by
a mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observers
on shore to leave the ship. The wind
was north-northwest, and heavy seas
were running. Patrol vessels and de
stroyers immediately proceeded to
the spot, and a party was sent along
the coast to search, but only some
bodies and a capsized boat have been
found thus far. As the entire shore
has been searched I greatly fear there
is little hope of there being any sur
vivors.
His Greatest Achievement
Foremost of his achievements is the
creation from England's untrained
manhood of a huge army. At the
beginning of the war, Great Britain
had only a few hundred thousand
trained men. Today more than 5,
000,000 men are enrolled for the var
ious branches of service. Kitchener
was last mentioned in the cabled dis
patches of Friday when he went to
Westminister palace to be questioned
by members of the house of commons
who were not satisfied with the con
duct fthe war. No intimation was
given that he intended to leave Eng
land.
Kitchener, who was appointed sec
retary of state for war on August 8,
1914, soon after the British declara
tion of war on Germany, is regarded
England's greatest soldier. There
have been no recent reports of Kitch
ener's movements.
The Hampshire was one of the
Devonshire class of six cruisers. She
was built in 1903, and normally car
ried 655 men.
Greatest Naval Battle
On May 31 off the coast of Den
mark was fought what is probably
the greatest naval battle of modern
times. The loss sustained by the
British is severe according to press
reports the vessels lost representing
over 100,000 tons while the German
loss was stated to be about 40,000
tons. Definite information regarding
the conflict are not obtainable as re
ports fro mthe several countries ma
terially differ.
WORK STARTED ON NEW FIRST
NATIONAL BANK BUILDING
Last week work was commenced on
the new First National bank build
ing which will occupy the site at the
corner of Main street and Broadway
adjoining the Rawson building.
Old Landmark Gone
The little old wooden structure that
has occupied that site for a number
of years was one of the oldest frame
buildings on upper Main street, and
ten years ago was the home of The
Graphic. It formerly stood where the
Rawson building now is and it was
while it was the home of this paper
that it was moved to the corner lot.
While the building has outlived its
usefulness the tough old cottonwood
lumber in its frame was still strong
and showed little detoriation.
The new building will be made a
handsome two story structure cover
ing the entire site from the tele-
8lain
hone building on Broadway to the
street front The ground floor,
on completion of the building will
be occupied, by the Creaser drug store
and the Williston Electric Construc
tion company.

DELEGATION DELIGHTED WITH
THE RECEPTION ACCORDED
THEM HERE
Tuesday evening the special train of
twelve cars bearing the delegation of
100 men, members of the Minneapo
lis Civic & Commerce association,
pulled into the station here at 6:45
where the visitors were greeted by a
large gathering of Williston folks,
and the Williston band. The fact that
rain had been falling almost contin
uously for twelve hours prior to the
arrival of the guests did not dampen
the ardor or the welcome accorded
them, although it made necessary
some alteration in the plans of the
entertainment committee. The auto
mobile trip being impractical the del
egation was escorted to the armory,
the famous First Regiment band,
which accompanied the business men
on their tour, heading the visiting
members.
At the Armory Pres. Craven of the
Williston city commission made a
brief but pleasing address of welcome
and he was followed by J. W. Jack
son who expressed his regret that the
weather prevented the carrying out of
the program as it had been planned.
In his excellent address Mr. Jackson
told the visitors how much the local
Commercial club and the citizens gen
erally appreciated having the Minne
apolis business men visit Williston,
pointing out the fact that a trip of
this kind draws city and country closer
together and accomplishes results that
would be wholly impossible in any
other manner.
Mr. J. C. Van Doom responded on
the part of the visiting delegation and
among other things mentioned in his
address he said that the Minneapoli
tians did not consider themselves "of
the east," but that Minneapolis was
a big brother of Williston's and that
the interests of the two communiies
were .common. Mr. Van Doom is con
necteJfwith thfe U.~ S. 'Rubber com
pany of Minneapolis, and also is a di
rector of the Civic and Commerce as
sociation.
Mr. Howard Strong, secretary of
the Civic and Commerce association,
gave a most interesting address along
the lines of organization and develop
ment. Mr. Strong gave evidence that
he was very familiar with conditions
in this state as shown by the sta
tistics, he quoted and his familiarity
with the resources, products, and de
velopment of North Dakota.
A large crowd had assembled at the
armory to hear the speeches and the
splendid concert by Rossiter's First
Regiment band, and about 8:30 the
delegates were informed that a dance
would be the entertainment for the
balance of the evening. The visitors
were then introduced en masse to the
bevy of ladies present and from all
appearances everyone seemed to en
joy the evening immensely. The
business men of Williston and the
Minneapolis men had an excellent op
portunity to get acquainted and to
talk over matters of interest without
missing the pleasant social diversion
of the evening. A unique feature of
the arrangement was that the young
ladies present wore a little pennant
or card on which was written their
name.
At 11:30 it was announced that
luncheon would be served from that
time until 1 o'clock in Odd Fellow's
hall. This finished off the evening in
a manner which seemed to please all
hands. The visitors are reported to
have repeatedly made the statement
that the entertainment accorded them
here was the first real recepion they
had received on the trip and that it
was certainly one of genuine pleasure.
The guests departed on their special
at 8 o'clock Wednesday morning.
Manitoba Ousts
John Barleycorn
Winnipeg, June 1.—Overnight the
province of Manitoba has become a
desert. At 7 p. m. yesterday John
Barleycorn was drummed out of camp
forever.
Winnipeg is the first city of its size
in the world to go dry by its own vote.
Alberta goes dry July -. Saskatch
ewan already has taken over the sale
of liquor and promises a vote on pro
hibition in December. British Co
lumbia will settle the liquor question
this summer, and in Ontario the ques
tion will be put to voters soon.
A total of 196 bars was affected by
the Macdonald act in the province, 69
in Winnipeg. A number already had
closed as a result of the referendum.
Seven breweries will be affected. They
will not have to close down, but cannot
sell liquor in the province.

VISIT WILLISTON
RAY ENTERTAINED BIG SUN
DAY SCHOOL CONVENTION
Blue skies, plenty of sunshine and
fine roads were enjoyed by the many
delegates and visitors who attended
the convention of the Williams County
Bible School association held at Ray
the evening of June third and all day
the fourth.
Seven auto loads of delegates and
interested friends left Williston Sat
urday afternoon to take part in the
big parade which was to open the an
nual meeting.
Sunday eight autos, many of them
beautifully decorated and led by the
Ray band, moved through the main
business and residence streets of Ray,
finally forming a complete circle
around the race track where the band
gave a short concert. Special men
tion should be made of the auto of C.
W. McGee which was devoted to the
cradle roll of the Ray Sunday school.
On the front of the car was a cradle
holding a large baby doll while the
car itself was filled with tiny tots.
After the band concert the crowd
adjourned to the opera house where
the opening session was held. Rev.
H. S. Harriss, president of the asso
ciation presided, and after the sing
ing of "Onward Christian Soldiers"
by the audience he presented Attorney
Moellring of Ray who welcomed the
convention to Ray. James Hoffman
Batten of Williston who delivered an
address on the "Foundation Stones of
Society'' dealing particularly upon the
influence of the home which today, he
said, is being lost by an attempt to
shift its responsibilities upon the
church and the schools.
Before introducing the next speak
er the chair appointed committees on
finance, nominations and resolutions.
The second speaker was Rev. Walter
A. Snow of Fargo, general secretary
of the State Sunday School associa
tion. Mr. Snow said his address was
to be a story—and the story he told
was of a big man who, through the in
fluence of his boyhood Sunday school
teacher is now devoting his life to
juvenile church work and studying
and handling boys of every age and

GREAT CONVENTIONS
OPEN AT CHICAGO
ROOSEVELT AND HUGHES ARE
BIG FACTORS—PARTY FEUD
MAY COME TO END
Chicago, June 7.—The Republican
and Progressive national conventions
opened here today an hour apart with
growing hopes of harmony and the
possibility that this week may see the
end of the bitter feud born here four
years ago.
Leaders of both factions, seeking
beds at dawn today, did so with set
tled convictions that incidents which
would become historical in American
political annals were immediately im
pending.
Rain which began yesterday noon
continued over night and today. Flags,
buntings and streamers hung wet and
dejected. Policemen, physicians and
nurses furnished for emergency pur
poses, were at their stations early.
Early today there was considerable
talk of peace plans among republicans
and progressives, although it was
said nothing definite had been decided
upon.
Both sides seemed desirious of
bringing about harmony if possible.
The plan is said to be to have both
conventions appoint a harmony com
mittee as soon as practicable. It is
pointed out this plan is more satis
factory than having negotiations con
tinued without definite authority from
the delegates.
Chicago, June 6.—Just before go
ing into a conference with republican
leaders, George Perkins, the Roose
velt leader, today issued a statement
declaring that Roosevelt had not said
he would refuse to support Hughes or
any other man and assailed the
Hughes supporters for making capital
of his "preparedness speech" in
Washington last night.
Political leaders, who profess to be
willing to accept any man for the
presidential nomination who is able to
command the support of both repub
licans and progressives, are trying to
day to determine whether Justice
Hughes has been strengthened or
weakened by the temporary concen
tration of all forces upon him with
the avowed purpose of eliminating
Roosevelt as a republican possibility.

GRADUATION CLASS
RECEIVE DIPLOMAS
AUDITORIUM FILLED TO CAPAC
ITY BY THRONG WHICH AT
TENDED EXERCISES
The Class of 1916, Williston High
School, was not only large numerical
ly but was exceedingly popular with
the general public if the attendance
at their commencement exercises is
to be taken as a criterion.
Nearly an hour before the pro
gram commenced the large hall be
gan to fill and by the time that the
class march was played there was
not a vacant seat to be seen. Garbed,
in cap and gown, as becomes a senior
class, the graduates took their seats
on the stage, and the program opened
with the singing of "Away to.the
Fields" by the high school chorus of
150 voices, after which Rev. I. G.
Monson offered prayer.
A solo, "O'er The Billowy Sea," by
Howard E. McDonald was oni of tfrr
most pleasing numbers on the pro
gram as the hearty applause gave
proof.
"America, God's Melting Pot," the
oration by Miss Irene Petty, saluta
torian, was well delivered and gave
evidence of the fact that the young
lady had given careful attention and'
study to the preparation of her sub
ject.
Carl T. Hogan, valedictorian of'tk»
class of '16, chose as a topic for hi*
oration "This Wonderful Republic," at
selection which was indeed most time
ly and appropriate. Mr. Hogan han
dled his interesting subject in a
pleasing manner, his delivery was ex
cellent and his poise and expression:
equal to that of much more mature
orator.
The high school chorus then favor
ed the audience with "Miller's Woo
ing," (Fanning).
The commencement address waa
given by the well known speaker, Dr
Karl R. Stolz, of Wesley College, on
the topic
MTh^
Practical Idealist." Dr.
Stolz always •er$instructiYe and'

DEATH SUMMONS YOUNG MAtf
While* seated at the dining table
at his home in the Union block Satur
day afternoon about 1:30 John
Von Nieda suddenly collapsed and ex
pired a few moments later, death be
ing due to heart failure. With him at
the time of his death was his wife.
Dr. Jones was immediately summoned
but death had claimed its victim be
fore he arrived. The body was re
moved to the Hamre undertaking par
lors and Sunday was taken to Minne
apolis where interment will be made,
Minneapolis being the home of the
young man's parents.
Mr. Von Nieda had been a resident
of Williston for several years andtf
was employed at the Great Northern
offices here. The young man was
2S-
years, 6 months of age and was a na
tive of North Dakota having been
born at Fargo. A year aero he was
united in marriage with Miss Katie
Prebel, a young lady who has grown
up in Williston. The many friends
and acquaintances of Mrs. Von Neida
sympathize with her in the deep sor
row that has so suddenly come upon
her.
Mrs. Von Neida left for Minneapo
lis Tuesday noon to attend the funeraL.
