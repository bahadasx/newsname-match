The , republican national convention

recommending the seating of 987?del

unanimously adopted. The temporary

when he said, "Well, we left the door

That was the progressive leader's
reply to the inquiry as to whether
there was any prospect of harmony,
and whether conference ; committees
would likely be appointed to receive

Republican leaders also discounted
the success of peace talk, saying ac

EUNICE OF THE
TOTALLY UI1FIT
Russia and Germany Thru the Med
ium of Sweden Swap Their.
Human Wrecks
Stockholm, Sweden, June. 8. The
great task of exchanging wounded
prisoners between Russia and Ger
many through Sweden will be contin
ued throughout the summer. The ex
change applies only to those prison
ers totally unfit ever to serve again.
The transfer through Sweden is
handled entirely by the Swedish Red
Cross, or. "Roda Korset," of which
Prince, Carl, brother of the king, is
the actual and active head. The Ger
man prisoners are received from" the
Russians at Haparanda at the Swedish-Finnish
frontier, only a few miles
south of the sweep of the Arctic
Circle. In trains specially fitted for
their use the maimed and twisted
wrecks of men are ; taken south thru
the entire distance ojf Sweden, a jour
ney of three nights an dtwo days, the
pace of the train being timed for the
utmost of comfort. At Trelleborg, the
southernmost part of Sweden, the one
time soldiers of the fatherland are
placed upon German hospital trans
ports for the short sail across the
southern reach of the Baltic to the
German port of Sassnitz. From there
they are taken to Hamburg and held
in detention for one month as a
guarantee against the importation of
any infectious disease. This quaran
tine period ended, the men, most of
them dependents for life, are return
ed to their relatives and homes. "
In the case of the Russian prison
ers the operation is just reversed.
They are received from the German
ships at Trelleborg and are taken to
the north through the glowing sun
shine and the mysterious . nights of
the Arctic latitudes, where soon the
days will fade one into the other with
only a shadow of twilight in between.
The work has began this year with
one train a week in each direction.
This month the number will be in
creased to three , in each direction.
The trains consist of sixteen cars and
have a capacity of about 235 soldiers.
When the work is fully under way
the rate, of exchange will be about
3,000 prisoners a month. As the per
centage, of "totally unfit" among the
men must be comparatively small,
some idea Amay be gained as to the
total number of prisoners on both
sides of the Russian-German battle
line.

CAME III TIME TO
. HELP THE CBOPS
Heavy Rains of this Morning Were
More than Welcome to Farmers
of Marion County
The heavy rains which swept over
the city and county early today were
more than ' welcome.
"Today's rain has greatly increased
Marion county's chance for a bumper
corn crop," said R. W. Blacklock,
government demonstration agent,
when asked wllat. he. thought would
be the effect on the crops. "The rain
came in good time to furnish moisture
to make the ear, and I believe that
enough water fell to make the early
planted corn, and the late planted
corn will now be able to' recover from
the effects of the late drouth, and
another good rain in a week or so
wilLmake that safe. It looks as if
the corn crop was safe . all around,
therefore."
Mr. Blacklock said tha the. water
melon situation appeared much , bet
ter as a result of the , rain, and he
thought that the melons would be
much larger and of a better quality.
"It would be a s good step for the
growers," he said, "to spray immed
iately with Bordeaux mixture to con
trol the anthracnose. The melons and
vines should be thoroughly sprayed.
This will help greatly to control the
rot which causes the melons to decay
in transit." t ,
The effect on the cantaloupes, Mr.
Blacklock believes, will be less fav
orable, as 3 too much rain at this stage
of the crop will cause the fruit to
ripen very rapidly and; to rot. Cot
ton, peanuts, cane and the regular
field crops will, take on new life, ac
cording to the demonstration agent.
The pastures will improve rapidly
and hogs and cattle will get a good
start for early fattening.
"Now is the time to put peas in the
corn jpniddles," said Mr. Blacklock,
and the farmer who has not planted
velvet beans or peanuts in his corn
should v plant peas at the last culti
vation. This will add greatly to next
year's crop on the land The pea has
has the ability to store nitrogen from
the air, and Prof. McQuarrie states
that the pea will also aid in saving
potash which has been taken from
the ground, where the peas will again
take it up and store it until fall. If
there is nothing to take up the potash,
the chances are that it will bV washed
away by the summer rains. The same
thing is true of the other fertilizing
elements.
"Care must be used after these
heavy rains in the cultivation of all
crops," was a warning given by Mr.
Blacklock. "Deep plowing when the
ground is wet is more injurious than
wrhen the ground is dry. It is best to
just stir the top of the soil, and the
sooner the better.""

SOME
C1IICE THAT THE SECOIID CHOICE VOTES
WILL SAVE THE STATE
The matter of engrossing interest
today is whether Knott or Catts will
receive the nomination for governor
Catts - is not far ahead of Knott on
first choice votes, and it is very likely
that the second choice ballots will put
the democratic candidate to the good.
Catts has not received more than a
third of the votes, and it is beyond
dispute that if anyone of his oppon
ents had had the good sense and
patriotism to drop out his - defeat
would have been sure.' "
Sheriff Galloway, this morning re
ceived a dispatch from Knott, saying
that he believed his election was cer
tain, but that his friends must be
sure to see that he did not lose any
cf his second choice vote. It is the
accepted opinion that Catts' first
choice vote represents almost his en
tire strength. :
Full returns from all precincts and
summing up the second choice vote
has made no difference in the results
as announced yesterday, except in
the case ofv sheriff. Mr. Galloway iiad
but a narrow margin over his nearest
opponent, Mr. Adams, and he stead
ily lost that on second choice votes,
until it begins to look like he will be
defeated by four or five ; votes not
many, but enough. ;.
Other returns are as follows:

governor by only about 300 votes.
This assures the nomination of Mr.

London, June 8. The French of3

Germans have taken Fort Vaux,
northeast of Verdun. This was claim
ed by the Germans last night, who
said the garrison surrendered, . 700
unwounded men being taken prisoner.
The French assert the garrison
withdrew after the fort had been re

day bombardment. The French claim
their troops still occupy the outskirts
of, the fort, having successfully re
pulsed all German attacks. The
French say the capture of Fort Vaux

Mr. N. A. Blitch says that the rail

if the representatives of the city had

Mr. Blitch, member of the commis

ed out that existing laws prevented
the commission from taking any ac
