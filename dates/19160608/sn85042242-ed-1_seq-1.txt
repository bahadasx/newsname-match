Bombardment,

Slav Offensive Costly, British
anil Germans Engage in
Battle.
For* Viuix, live miles northeast, of
Wrdiin, has at. last, fallen into the
hands of the Teutons, according to
Ilerlin. The men who defended the
fort, to tlie last, surrendered to the?
Germans, who also captured a large
number of suns, machine guns and
mine throwers.
T'arls, however, says the fort was
still in French hands early Wednes­
day morning, but that since then it
lias,been impossible to communicate
with it owing to violence of bombard­
ment.
Gains by Russians.
Gains of considerable proportions
by Russians over the Teutonic allies,
by Turks over Russians and Germans
over Hrilttfc 'are reported in- latest

gion of Verdun violent, combats are
progressing while on the Italian side,
the Italians continue to hold the Aus
tt }ans from further advance. In the
fighting around the Pripet marshes,

sians in their big offensive move­
ments, have dislodged the Teutonic
allies from 4f» positions, and brought
their aggregate of men capturel up to
about 41,0ftfV. They have also taken
77 guns, 134 machine guns and 4!)
bomb throwers. *Among the man made
prisoners, are flOO officers.

Germans and British are still fight­
ing desperately in the vincinity of
Ypres, both sides using artillery in
heavy liombanlments and infantry in
occasional attacks. In an infantry at
tack against the ruined vii! of
'Houge, east of Ypres, Germans suc­
ceeded in capturing British front line
trenches running through the village,
hiit. all their attacks elsowhtre failed.
•Aroitrid Verdun,- in tile region of Hill
.",04, and on the right bank of the
Meuae from Damloup to Doumont, the
bombardments continue intense.
PAPERS CONSERVATIVE
REGARDING EARL
KITCHENER'S DEATH
Berlin, via Longdon, June 6.—The
newspapers pay much tribute to Earl
Kitchener, .but there seems to be no
disposition, to exaggerate the import­
ance of l»is death. The papers for
the most part, refrain from attacking
Germany's,, dead opponent. The
Deutsche Tablische Rundschau open­
ly confesses to dislike, but also ad­
miration, for Kitchener, saying:
"He was an honorable enemy. He
never visited Germany to admire our
philosophy aitd maneuvers, and never
pretended to love us. We thank him
to death for that. He was a brutal
man, but he was a man."
BALFOUR CLAIMS
ADVANTAGES GAINED
FOR BRITAIN
Yondon, June 7.—One result of the
North Sea battle of last week is that
for many months it will be impossible
for the Germans to attempt naval
movements, winch they might have
undertaken before the battle was
fought, said A. J- Balfour, first lprd
of the admiralty, in an address deliv­
ered today. In his speech, made be­
fore the British Imperial Council of
Commerce, Mr. Balfour said it was
Impossible at present to go into de­
tails of the battle, as he had no con­
nected view of the whole action from
any authentic source. British losses
had been stated accurately, while no
value could be placed on the German
reports, which Mr. Balfour declared
were tainted from the first.
Dealing with the broad issues of the
result of the battle, Mr. Balfour de­
clared the German losses were great­
er than the British, and asked why,
if the Germans had defeated the Brit-:
,ish, they had not pressed their ad-
Vantage. As a result of the battle,
Balfour declared, the Germans dream
of an invasion of England had been
dissipated, and in regard to the block­
ade and control of the seas, the posi­
tion of the Germans was worse,

PRES. WILSON COMPLETES
PRELIMINARY DRAFT
Washington, June 7.—The outcome
of the administration's efforts to keep
the United States out of war and at
he same ime mainain the national
honor will be the foundation of the
foreign affairs plank and one of the
emphasized points in tlie platform to
be adopted by the National Oemocrt
ic convention at St.. Louis, according
to authoritative information obtained
tonight from administrative soures.
As ft result of conferences with bis
advisers and members of his cabinet,
the president, who began work sev­
eral days ago on a platform to be
submitted to the convention by party
leaders, virtually had completed a
preliminary draft, leaving only de­
tails to be finished after the republi­
can and progressive conventions in
Chicago. The president has utilized
as a basis for his work feature'", of
the l&iBriouri state democratic plat­
form, which wao prepared, "officials
made known tonight, under the direc­
tion of the White House.
It is understood the national plat­
form will declare the success of the
administration in guarding the honor
and interests of the United States in
tho face of obstacles, and at
(fhe
same time keeping the nation at
peace.
DHTTEIIS
International Commission May Be
Appointed to Adjust Con­
troversies.
Washington, June 7.—A proposal to
Gen. Carranza that the United States
and the Mexican de facto governmtSit
submit the whole subject, of their re­
lations to an international commis­
sion is being seriously considered by
the administration.
Such a proposal, if it is made, will
serve as a reply to the Mexican note
demanding the withdrawal of the Am­
erican troops, and may contemplate
the adjustment of many unsettled dif­
ferences, that for years have caused
accumulating embarrassment in the
relations of the two nations.
Settlement by a commission is pro­
vided for expressly by the treaty of
1848, which provides further that
"should such a course be proposed by
either party, it shall be acceded to by
the other unless deemed by it alto­
gether incompatible with the nature
of the differences or the circumstanc­
es of the case."
President Wilson and Gen. Carran­
za would appoint an equal number of
commissioners under the plan, and
the, meeting would be held somewhere
outside the territory of both- countries.
There was no, indication tonight that
the president, with whom rests the
final word as to the proposal, had
reached a decision or that the reply
would go forward within the next few
days.
RURAL CREDITS BILL
Kansas City, Mo., June 7.—The
rural credits bill now before con­
gress, was attacked at today's meet­
ing here fthe board of governors of
the Investment Bankers Association
of America, and the association, it
was declared, will- oppose it through
the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States.
The board adjourned after fixing
October 2, 3 and 4 as the dates for the
1916 convention, to be held in Cin­
cinnati.

Four Announce They Will Stay
by Candidate Approved by

Chicago, June 7.—As a part of the
policy of lying up Roosevelt votes,
the four stalwarts on the North Da­
kota delegation announced today that
they-intended hi stay-by Ua VolleHe,
thff mail indiwed in the slate primar­
ies. The \ther d:t debates Wifltld
like to go to Roosevelt after the first
ballot.
"Of course there is no way to pre­
vent: any delegate from breaking
away whenever he wants to," said
C. U. Little of Bismarck "but we
believe in adhering to the law. We
have no riBhl to forsake LuFollette
until lie releases us. If the others
want to desert him at the first oppor­
tunity, let them do it, but we have
some regard for our pledges."
The irony of the situation is that
the four stalwarts really have no use
for I .a Folletle, while the other six
are warm partisans of the Wisconsin
man. They would stay by him cheer­
fully if they thought, lie stood any
chance to win.
R. M. Pollock of Fargo was chosen
late yesterday to second La Follette's
nomination in behalf of North Dakota.
The delegation organized as follows:
Chairman, James A. Buchanan
secretary, O. 13. Burtness resolutions,
J. E. Paulson: credentials, James Mc*
Cormick: permanent organization,
B. Little rules, Myron P. Johnson
honorary vice president of the con­
vention, H. P. Haivorstn to notify
presidential nominee, Claude C. Tur­
ner: to notify vice presidential nomi­
nee, E. A. Bowman.
The delegation formally ratifler
Gunder Olsen's election as national
committeeman in the primaries. Mr.
Olsen is on the ground, also Thomas
F. Marshall, retiring national commit­
teeman, and Frank Sprague, state
chairman.
