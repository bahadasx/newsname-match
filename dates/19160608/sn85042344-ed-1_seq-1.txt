ceaselessly nil Chicago Mince yes

at a premium today, drenched
delegates and spectators who
wero compelled to make their
way on foot to and from the con

attempts at out-of-door demon

five thousand of them, suf
fragists from many states,

one hour and twenty mlnntes Senator
Harding, the temporary chairman, de

punctuated in the telling points with

Those of the old-time leaders pres

aisles to their seals to the tune of an
uproar walked in today almost un

shots with a citizens' posse before

bandits and citizens.

Nation's Needs.
GlIIOACO, June 7 National pre

tho Progressive patty's platform, of
which a tentative draft was com
pleted tonigh by th resolutions com
mittee appointed at today's session of
the convtntion. It breaks party con
vention platform records for brevity
and consists of a broad statement of
conditions facing and remedies need
ed by the nation, rather than the
usual formidable array of separate
planks.
As to preparedness, the platform de
clares for a navy sji mid in the world's
armadas, standing crniy of two hun
dred und fifty thousand, and "uni
versal opportunity for military train
ing under federal supervision". So
cial and economic retorms and "so
cial Justice" ftaturcs of the 1912 plat
torm are reaffirmed, 'full political
suffrage" Is ei.dorj.'d. a permanent
expert tarlfr commission, high pro
tective tariff, regulation of industries,
conservation and development ef na
tional rcsotirci s are urged.
Is Issue oi .Men.
The platform declares that the
present situation make:: an issue for
men. lather than words, and closes
with the declaration that tho Pro
gressives "will met any party who
sees the hath n's needs ami puts for
ward a leader fit to meet it."
Following is the text of the ten
tative platform drift:
"This is the year of decision for
the nation's future. As we now de
cide, si we shall go fi rvvard In right
eousness and power, or backward in
degradation and weakness.
"Of necessity we deal now with the
foundations of our national iife, We
are facing elemental facts of force, of
right and wrong, of extreme national
peril. our present choice of path
will he irrevocable. The tradition of
isolation has been ended. The 1'nite 1
States is now part of a world system
of civilization. We stand or fall as
wo prepare to take our part in peace
or war nnd hold our own (herein.
"As members of an international
community we arc subject to certain
basic duties:
.Must Secure Clti.ciw.
"To secure the rights of our citi
zens at home and ntin ad.
"To guard the honor anil uphold
the Just Influence of our nation; to
maintain the integrity of international
law. These are the cornerstones of
civilizntic.n. We mist, he strong to
defend them.
"Tho present war shows that "It Is
the supreme duty of civilization to
create conditions which will make
peace permanent. Our country must
ho able and ready to take its part in
that work. The peace which we de
sire for our country Is not the pence
of submission and cowardice, but the
peace of Justice. War and its evils
will not be done away with by suf
fering injustice to ourselves or others
nor ly pledging ourselves to drastic
action for international right if we do
not prepare the force which would
sustain such action. We can perform
our rightful part In promoting perma
nent international peace only by a
willingness and a prepared ability to
defend our own rights and the rights
of other nations. We earnestly de
sire to keep the peace. Hut there are
higher things that we nv.tst. keep, as
Washington and Lincoln kept them
for us.
Arc fop Pcai'e First.
"We stand for peace, not war. Wk
believe in preparedness for defense,
not for aggression. We should m
sacrifice the lives of men for tin
glory or (fain of military conquest.
We therefore desire that the women
of the country who bear and rear Its
soldiers and make and keep its homes
shall have the full political privilege
of suffrage.
"Arms alone cannot maintain a na
tion. Of far greater permanent im
portance must stand a national In
dustry efficient for the general wel
fare, a prosperity Justly distributed,
a national life organized in all points
for national ends. Four years ago
this party was born o a nation's
awakened sense of these fundamental
truths. In the platform then adoptea
wo set forth our position on public
questions. We here reaffirm these
declarations. They are made on na
tional Issues.
"A nation to survive must stand for
the principles of social and industrial
justice. We cannot permit the op
pr?ssion of any class and expect of
that class high Ideals of patriotism.
We must protect the wage earner, de

over Presidi nt Taft, and exceeded by
eight minutes the eel hrated demon.
str.ition for William Jennings Hryan
in Henver lr 1H0S.
Raymond Robins, temporary chair
man of the convention, had spoken
just three sentences of his !evnote
pceh whin he mentioned Colonel
Itoos.'X elt's name. A wave of en
thusiasm that amounted to nothing
less than a paroxysm resulted. "The
foremost citizen of the world" was
the characterization Hoblns used in
connection with his mention of the
colonel's name. The response was
instantaneous.
"Wo Wunt Teddy!"
"We want Teddv!" roared the dele
gates, and the demonstration was on.
With umbrellas ruis.d, they becan
inarching about the hall They
flowed upon the stage and wiling
Victor Mnrdock's hand until the stal
wart K iwhihu'h-evtlr "was wilted.
Hamilton Fish, jr., und another man
relzed a delegate hearing an Ameri
can flag and carried him around the
hall on their shoulders. Manners
were torn from their places and
stanchions were lifted from the floor
as ttie shouting host tramped
around.
Chairman Robins made several at
tempts to quell the demonstration,
hut after u few raps of the gavel
rave it tip. The kind chimed in
with the Progressive battle hymns
and soon the surging crowd was
tramping the aisles to the strains of
"inward. Christian Soldier". 1 e
splte the handicap of the steps lead
ing up into the balcony the demon
stration spread th re, and soon the
spectators in the baler nies loined In.
H.inners were snatched from their
hangings and waved, bearing these
Inscript ions:
"Teddy and safety first"; ' If Teddy
was president, where would Villa
lie?"; "The people want T. It., n reg
ular American": "Why take chances?
W Know A'hat Roosevelt can do";
" c want T-dily." and other Piogies
sive slogans
Itaiuli I'lay Medley.
Then the band switched to "March
ing Through (ieorgia" and a medley of
popular airs and the aisles became so
blocked that no one moved for several
minutes. While the rrarcheis stood
still in the ia?n they k'.pt up ti e din
ami aiier n iiiin oi '-n going on one
hour Ceorge W. Perkins left the stage
nnd decided to go to his hotel and
wait for It to sul side. The Michigan
delegation tramped In from the rain
outside and their leaders demanded
an outdoor demonstration.
"Teddv Is not afraid of the rain,"
they shouted 1 "get out nnd march,"
and they filed from the hall Into the
deluge outside chanting "Teddy,
you're a bear." Some of the delegates
returned in their soggy garments with
banners ami flags bedraggled and
dripping, but their enthusiasm was
not dampened, for they Joined tho
marching, roaring throng again
The lenders impressed by what they
realized might have been the diffi
culty of holding the convention from
proceeding immediately to nomina
tions, and then discussed means to
quiet the uproar.
"1-et them yell." counselled one of
the leaders. "Now that they have
shouted it will be easier to delay ac
tion on a nomination."
No Police Called In.
A proposal to use the uniformed rn
llee to quell the demonstration was
disi ussed among the leaders, but it
was decided that the experiment was
too dangerous. It v this time seme of
the enthusiasts who hnd been waving
bandanas became dissatisfied with
their efforts so they took off their
coats and waved therr about their
heads. One delegate put a black
slouch hat with a Viandana around
the rim on a tall pole aad paraded
around. "Whoopee!" he roared,
"she's in the ring." The delegates
from Washington state wrapped an
American flag about one of their
women members and carried her up
and down the aisles.
Other western women took the cue
and for the next few minutes there
was a continuous flag demonstration.
Meanwhile, scouts came in with I he
report that the Republican convention
at the coliseum had adjourned and
had not been marked by any special
enthusiasm. Their arrival was the
signal for another outbreak. Chair
man Robllt finally gave up the gavel
and took up a "blK stick." The crowd
caught the point and began to quiet
down.
Resumes PpcPrlt.
Finally at 2:37 Mr. Robins resumed
his speech after telling the leaders
that he would not risk mentioning
the colonel's name again. During the
remainder of his address there were
outbursts and demonstration. but
they w. re short. When Mr Rubins
declared the American people w erw
waiting fur the Progressive convey
Hon to name a leader the dclcgaii.s .
chorused:
"We'll name him"
When Mr. Robins referred to!
Colonel Roosevelt at another point as
"the favorite son of the nation ' there
was another outburst and at the close
of his address there were yells oi
"three rlii its for Robins." j
i ne cnairiuan rapped t hem ilovvn
wilh bis g.ivcl and announced that the
convention would proceed with its
business. He explained that it was
necessary for the committees to have
time for their work. If the mtich-ilis-ciisscd
"uncontrollable element" had
any idea of brooking no delay aim
proceeding at once to the nomination
of Colonel Roosevelt they gave no evi
dence of it but s icd satisfied.
Promises n Itclny. '
"I for one promise then' shill he
no unnecessary delay," Mr. Robins
.-ihl them "We shall move just as
I' ist as possible."
With that the convention ailjoiirneo
until tomorrow afienoon at '2 o'clock.
The smgcsiioii of disc. oil came with a
movement against the sebc'.ion or
Waller Crown of Ohio as p r in .i ru n t
chairman. Those In h:nd it wanted
to present ilevernor Johnson of Cal

The a n iiouncenient of teniporarv
committees followed and the first
day's session of the convention w a i

ers would not be able to hold their
delegates from the nomination of
Colom l Roosevelt at the mention of
his name had not matei lalieil How
long they will be able to control them,
however, Is conceded by the Progres
