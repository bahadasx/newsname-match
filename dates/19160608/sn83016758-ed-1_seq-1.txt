A FRIENDJF LABOR
That's What Frank B. Kellogg Proved
Himself to Be to Employees
of the Great Western.
Labor Showed It's Appreciation Later
by Urging His Appointment
to Supreme Court Bench.
That Frank B. Kellogg, now conspic
uous in the public eye because of his
candidacy for the republican nomina
tion for United States senator, was
one time seriously considered for the
supreme bench of the United States is
not generally known.
That organized labor was responsi
ble for the movement, in his behalf
may possibly be a surprise to some,
yet such is the case, and there are
\ords both at Washington and in
..^session of several well-known labor
organizations to bear out the state
ment Geographical difficulties alone
prevented realization.
The story of how this well-known
attorney all but became attached to
the highest court in the land, and how
organized labor lent its best efforts in
his behalf, is one of human interest.
It may sound commonplace in the
telling, but it is of interest just the
same, and if nothing else, forcibly
illustrates the point that labor is not
always ungrateful. At any rate it
was most gracious Mr. Kellogg's
case and the memory of it all still re
mains.
Born to toil himself, ^pending his
youth at the arduous tasks of the
farm, making his own way almost
from his youth up and securing his
'education by dint of sacrifice and
economy, Mr. Kellogg knew the life
of the man who toils, knew how a
dollar made its way into tLe pocket
of labor, and when the opportunity
offered he showed himself a friend of
the man whose struggles were similar
to those which he had undergone in
reaching the position in life that he
had attained. Organized labor learned
of his friendship in a peculiar way, and
although he had not been in a position
to demonstrate his fealty to the man
in the overalls, and had not come in
contact with them except in a casual
-^-sjray, his heart and mind still clung to
cause and only opportunity was
cessary to throw the light upon his
devotion.
Back 1908 the Great Western
railroad was placed in the hands of a
receiver. Its moving spirit was A. B.
Stickney, still a venerable and vener
ated citizen of St. Paul. As head of
the line he had been recognized as
friendly to the men who toiled with
their hands, but owing to the finan
cial and business conditions, and es
pecially the cramped financial condi
tion of this line, he had been unable
to demonstrate his friendship.
It was following a period of strin
gency and business depression that the
receivership came. The panic of the
fall of 1907 had practically paralyzed
business. Wall street was wild and
the feverish excitment of that bourse
had spread its e\il to all parts of the
land and to all avenues of trade. Even
small business men were anxious and
the big banking centers were unable
to sleep. In many of the larger cities
the clearing houses were issuing cer
tificates in place of currency, factories
were closing or running on short time,
and the country was grave concern
over the condition that prevailed.
As is usually the case the first to
feel the pinch were the laboring men.
Retrenchment was general and it be
Ngan with the cutting of payrolls, the
lowering of wages and the laying off
of men. It was thus with the Great
Western railroad when the receivers
took charge.
Frank B. Kellogg of St. Paul was
general counsel for the Great Western
when the order for retrenchment came
from the receivers. Mr. Stickney
picked him up when he was a strug
gling attorney down in Olmsted coun
ty, to take charge of the legal end of
his growing properties. He was a
keen judge of the stuff that is in man,
and right here labor was to be the
beneficiary of his insight. The period
in question was a crisis, not only in
the case of the employees of the Great
Western, but it portended disaster
also to the workmen of probably
every other railroad in the country.
It simply meant that if a cut was
permitted in wages on the Great
Western that a similar retrenchment
would spread to the other roads of the
country and a vast and costly strike
would follow. The leaders of organ
ized railroad labor were naturally
worried.
As retrenchment in big business
usually begins with the reductions-of
wages of the workmen, so it was in
the case of the Great Western. The
cut directed by the directors was most
sweeping and included a schedule of
rules as to time that affected every
class of employment on the road.
Agreements in effect were disregard
ed, and the several lines of organized
labor represented, which included the
trainmen, enginemen and switchmen,
were practically told that it was either
acceptance or the loss of their jobs.
That arbitration would avail little was
intimated by the receivers.
Mr. Kellogg was in California at
the time and was without knowledge
of the order or its extent until several
days after its issuance. His first in
formation came from the heads of
organized labor, who without delay
turned to him for relief, and the gov
ernment which by this time had began
to realize the seriousness of the whole
thing. Active on the part of the gov
ernment at the time was Theodore
Roosevelt and the telegrams concern
ing the trouble and his appeal for a
settlement which passed between the
two are still of record. The originals
which are now in the possession of
Mr. Kellogg are among the most
prized of his many manuscripts.
Wiring the receivers to delay the
order Mr. Kellogg hastened back to
St. Paul and at once opened up nego
tiations for a settlement. While ad
mitting that retrenchment was neces
sary, Mr. Kellogg believed that it
could be done in other ways. He felt
the importance of the matter as not
only affecting the men in the employ
of the Great Western, but the un
doubted disastrous effect it would have
on labor employed by other lines of
railroad and business generally. He
knew that if permitted the order
would spread to every line of industry
in the country, and that misery and
possibly bloodshed would be the in
evitable result.
Mr Kellogg reached St. Paul on his
return about April 1, 1908, and tea
days later the receivers published a
notice withdrawing the proposed
schedule of rules as to time and con
pensation of engineers, trainmen and
switchmen. What followed is memor
able in organized train labor circles.
Instead of a cut in wages the receivers
eame to an agreement with the men
to use every effort to reduce terminal
overtime, constructive mileage and the
consumption of coal to a minimum,
which would retrench the system
sufficiently to allow it to live and pay
living wages to those its employ.
Throughout the negotiations Mr. Kel
logg was the masterhand, and when
the settlement of the controversy was
announced there was general rejoic
ing.
Among the first to recognize the
importance of the settlement reached
and its beneficial effect on labor gen
erally was President Roosevelt, who
without delay sent the following tele
gram to Mr. Kellogg:
The White House, Washington, D. C.
April 10, 1908.
Hon. Frank Kellogg,
St. Paul, Minn.
I thank you heartily on behalf of
the whole nation for what you have
been able to do. It is a great service
and the effect cannot but be beneficial
among all railroads.
Theodore Roosevelt.
Labor likewise was not unmindful
of the great service that Mr. Kellogg
had performed in its behalf, and de
cided to show its gratitude in some
substantial way. That opportunity
came three years later when with the
death of Justice Harlan of the Su
preme court bench and the resultant
vacancy on the bench, the heads of the
several divisions of organized train
men filed with Wm. H. Taft, then
president of the United States, a peti
tion requesting Mr. Kellogg's appoint
ment to the place. The advocacy of
Mr. Kellogg was sincere and forceful,
for the men desired not only to re
ward a faithful friend, but recognized
in him a man of ability and legal at
tainments qualifying him for the ex
alted position. The campaign in his
behalf was widespread and extended
not cnly to the organizations he had
befriended but to organizations in
other lines of labor.
A telegram to Mr. Taft asking for
Mr. Kellogg's appointment to the su
preme bench and signed by the heads
of four of the leading organizations
of trainmen is also one of the well
known attorney's most prized posses
sions and is here reproduced:
TT- T,
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1916
21, 1911. Dec
His Excellency, WM. H. TAFT, Presi
dent of the United States.
Sir:
As a vacancy exists on the bench
of the Supreme Court of the United
States, we would ask you to favorably
consider for appointment, to succeed
the late Justice Harlan, Mr. Frank
Kellogg of St. Paul, Minnesota.
We believe that his selection would
not only maintain the character and
dignity of the court, but that he will
bring to that-service talents and qual-
ifications that will inure to the bene
fit of the country.
Commending this matter to your
careful attentidh, we are Sir
Respectfully yours,
W. S. STONE,
Grand Chief Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers.
W. S. CARTER,
President cf Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Firemen and Engineers.
W. G. LEE,
President of Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen.
A. B. GARRETSON,
President of Order of Railway Con
ductors.
Labor's interest in Mr. Kellogg as far
as the supreme bench is concerned was
not realized, but it shows the bond of
sympathy between.the two and the
respect in which the trainmen held
him. President A. B. Garretson of
the Conductors afterwards writing
Mr. Kellogg said: "What I have done
in this connection is a pleasure," and
W. S. Stone, grand chief of the Loco
motive engineers, supplemented it
with the following: "We all realize,
I think, it would mean many sacri
fices for you to accept such an ap
pointment, but we also realize the need
of men like you to fill such places and
that is the reason that we gave you
the endorsement that we did. My only
regret is that the president has not
seen fit to name you for the position."
As stated, geographical difficulties
alone prevented Mr. Kellogg's possi
ble appointment to the vacancy on the
bench, but the story is interesting just
the same. To Mr. Kellogg the happen
ings of that periodhis success in
preventing the reduction of wages of
the employees of the Great Western
and later organized labor's apprecia
tion of his efforts,are among his
fondest memories.
County Commissioners Meet.
The board of county commissioners
met at the office of the county auditor
in regular adjourned session on Tues
day. All members were present and
Chairman Cater presided.
The school petition of Andrew Matt
son asking to have certain lands
owned by him set off from school dis
trict No. 29 and attached to district
31, came on for final hearing, and the
board adopted a resolution granting
said petition.
Four petitionsone from John Berg
a*id others, on? from Geo H. Small
wood and others, another from John
Swanson and others, and a joint peti
tion from Charley Nord and others
were duly presented to the board ask
ing for the formation of four new
school districts. One of the proposed
new districts embraces territory in
district 14, Borgholm, and lands in
the adjoining township in Kanabec
county. The date of hearing on the
petitions was set for July 10.
M. J. Cleveland, county engineer,
presented his resignation to the board,
and same was accepted. John P. Sod
erstrom of Foley was named as Mr.
Cleveland's successor, and Mille Lacs
county's share of the salary to be
paid him was fixed at $50 per month.
Mr. Cleveland has a position in his
home county, Stearns, and Mr. Soder
strom, who is county surveyor of Ben
ton county, will have charge of the
Mille Lacs-Benton district.
It being called to the board's atten
tion that county ditch No. 1 in the
town of Greenbush is in need of re
pairs, Commissioner Grow was named
a committee of one to investigate and
take the necessary steps to have
needed repairs made.
A resolution was adopted designat
ing three quarters of a mile of road
in section 31, Princeton town, a state
highway. This highway will connect
a state road in Sherburne county with
the crushed rock road leading west
from Princeton, at the first turn in
said road.
This concluded the work of the
board, and after acting on the reg
ulation grist of bills an adjournment
was taken. The next meeting will be
held on July 10.
Shockley-Anderson.
Mr. Henry Shockley and Miss El
freda Anderson were united in mar
riage at the Congregational parsonage
Saturday evening by Rev. Samuel
Johnson.
Mr. and Mrs. Shockley left at once
for Minneapolis for a brief wedding
trip. They will be "at home" in the
Wicktor residence, where the groom
had rooms in readiness before the
ceremony was performed.
The groom is a young man of gen
uine worth, and he enjoys .the confi
dence and esteem of all our citizens.
The bride is a young lady of pleasing
ways, and her happy disposition has
won her a large circle of friends.
These estimable young people have
the felicitations of all who know them,
and their future will indeed be pleas
ant if well wishes an so make it.
1916 COMMENCEMENT

P. H. S. Held at the Armory
Last Thursday Evening.
Dr. Geo. E. Vincent Delivers a Brilliant
AddressThirty-two Students
Receive Their Diplomas.
Appropriate and pleasing exercises
marked the graduation of the class of
1916 of the Prjnceton high school at the
armory last Thursday evening, and that
spacious building was filled with
friends and relatives of the graduates
who congregated there to listen to the
program prepared for the occasion.
The decorations were simple but
neatthe colors of the school and
class being used. A bank of fragrant
lilacs across the front of the stage
was one of the many pleasing features
of the decorations.
Th'is year's class was the largest
in the history of the local institution
of learning32 bright young men and
women having completed the high
school course.

The exercises commenced at 8
o'clock, and -while the high school or
chestra played a selection the grad
uates marched down an aisle of the
Armory, and took their seats upon
the stage. Each one wore American
Beauty roses, the class flower. Rev.
E. B. Service then pronounced the
invocation, and the salutatory by Miss
Florence Slater followed. It was brief
but decidedly appropriate, and the
Union gladly gives it hereunder in
full:
Friends, in behalf of the Senior
Class of 1916 of the Princeton high
school, I welcome you one and all to
our Commencement exercises, and in
doing so, I wish to thank you for the
kindly interest you have always shown
in connection with all our school ac
tivities. Our athletic games have al
ways been well attended, and our
school entertainments well patronized.
We doubly appreciate your presence
here to-night, as the occasion means
so much to us. Commencemei-t night
is an event to which we have looked
forward throughout all our high school
life.
Members of the Board of Education:
We realize that you have done all in
your power to make our school days
pleasant as well as profitable. You
have ever been considerate of our in
terests and have never placed upon us
any irksome restrictions. For the
many courtesies you have shown us,
we are indeed grateful.
Members of the Faculty: To you
and to those who preceded you, we
owe a debt of gratitude. You have
labored diligently and patiently to
make us capable of being graduates
of the Class of 1916. We have found
you ever ready to assist us in all our
difficulties in school life. We feel that
you have given us the best you have,
and we trust that the best will come
back to you.
Classmates: Some of us have been
school mates throughout our entire
school course others have joined us
of late years. Our sojourn together
has always been enjoyable. Our school
days have never been embittered by
class strife. A friendly spirit has al
ways existed among us. We have
learned to know each other's aims and
ideals, and to a certain extent, to
share each other's joys and sorrows.
I am sure that we can all of us join
together in saying that we will carry
-with us none but the most pleasant
recollections of our school days.
From my heart, I wish you
JoyClassmatesJoy!
Our life is closed, our life begins,
The long, long anchorage we leave,
JoyClassmatesJoy!
At the conclusion of the salutatory
Miss Marguerite Byers pleasingly ren
dered a three-part song, and it
delighted all present. Dr. George Ed
gar Vincent, president of the Univer
sity of Minnesota, who delivered the
commencement address, was then in
troduced by Dr. D. A. McRae, presi
dent of the Board of Education.
Princeton was indeed fortunate in
securing the services of Dr. George
E. Vincent upon an occasion of
this kind. The audience expected an
intellectual treat, and was not dis
appointed, as Mr. Vincent delivered a
masterly address which sparkled
throughout.
"Education and Efficiency" wa* the.
subject, and the speaker handled it so
intelligently and interestingly that the
audience fairly drank in every word.
It was decidedly different from the
usual Commencement address. The
graduates wer*e not showered with
mpty flattery, but they were inspired
to greater efforts to secure those
things in life that are more excellent.
Knowledge, wisdom and efficiency were
thoroughly analyzed by the speaker,
who pointed out the difference between
the accumulation of a mass of unre
lated facts, and the possession of
knowledge that could be used.
The need of enthusiasm if the ef
forts of life are to be crowned with
success, was emphasized by Mr. Vin
cent, and he also exalted the dreams
of youth. He called attention to the
great constructive work of the late
James Jerome Hill, and stated that,
the Greate Empire Builder was a
dreamer in youth, who had the en
thusiasm, power and ability to carry
his dreams of a new and rich north
western empire to a successful con
clusion.
In conclusion the speaker urged the
graduates to ever cherish the high
ideals that make life worth while
to develop strength of character, and
apply their knowledge along* right
lines. No attempt has been made to
do justice to the address, but it was
easily the ablest one ever delivered
upon a like occasion in our village, and
a delighted audience listened to it.
A two-part song was given most
pleasingly by some high school girls,
at the conclusion of President Vin
cent's brillant addrecs, and the vale
dictory by Miss Myrtle Nelson fol
lowed. It was a well prepared and
fitting effort, and it appears here
under:
Friends, school mates, teachers, and
members of the school board: We, as
a class, must now say farewell. We
realize that it is through your efforts
our high school days have been made
both pleasant and profitable and we
take this occasion to thank you for
your efforts in our behalf.
Class of 1916: We must also bid
farewell to one another. We have
trod the same path for four years, but
now we must each take a different path
and must each go his own way through
life. We know not what the future
has in store for us, but we each aim
to do well our part. May we never
forget the ideals set before us through
out our high school course and may
our future days be as profitably spent
as our high school days- hav been.
Let us remember what our motto
states, that this is "Only a Commence-
ment."
Most fittingly it has been said at
such a time as this:
Today our school-days end. A place we take
'Mong workers on a sea both large and wide.
With willing hand and every power awake,
We now advance to scenes by us untried.
Oh, may we each as jears receding glide,
Have strength to toil tho' stormy waves
roll high,
Life's watery may we ever safely ride,
Push on with hopeful heart and watchful eye,
Remembering that our Captain strong is
always nigh.
It is with pleasure we look ahead,
Our guide is one of love and yet of might
When all our feeble strength has from us fled,
He'll pilot us across life's sea aright,
And ever 'mid the deepest gloom send light
The sail is set, but where's the shore, my
friends,
Which we shall reach? Oh, is it dark or bright?
Which strand we gam upon ourselves depends,
The dark or bright, when at God's call our
journey ends
If but for self we live upon this earth,
A dark, dark shore will greet our weary eyes,
In work for others lies the truest worth,
Though oft such work our love and patience
tries,
We must not e'en the smallest task despise.
As we do deeds for Christ our spirit nears
A shining shore where Jasper walls arise,
And when our Father's throne of light appears
We'll dwell in peace with Him through
endless years.
The presentation of diplomas was
then made by Dr. D. A. McRae, and
the benediction by Rev. E. B. Service
concluded the exercises.
Good Roads Day,
Since the third Tuesday of June in
each year was designated as Good
Roads Day by the Dunn law of 1913,
the day has been properly observed
only once, and that was on the same
year the law was enacted. The good
work done on that occasion on the road
between the East Branch bridge and
the village limits is an evidence of
what can be accomplished in the way
of road improvement. That stretch of
road is as firm and solid to-day as it
was after the finishing touches were
administered to it three years ago and
has cost practically nothing for main
tenance.
Cannot something be accomplished
this year in the way of improving an
other of the roads leading into the
village^ Is there not one public-spir
ited citizen who will start the ball
Tolling?
There should be an effort made to
improve a piece of road in every com
munityseveral stretches in every
township' and in every village.
Let the public-spirited men and wo
men in each community get busy and
VOLUME XL. NO. 25
see to it that Good Roads Day is
properly observed this year by having
some piece of road improved on the
20th of June.
Mrs. Everett Morrison.
Mrs. Everett Morrison joined the
great majority at her home in this vil
lage Sunday morning. Heart failure
caused death. Mrs. Morrison had not
enjoyed the best of health for some
time, but no one imagined that death
was so near.

Automobile Accident.
While returning from a drive in an
Overland automobile early yesterday
morning, Odm Odegard collided with
a horse hitched to a buggy, being
driven by Jack and Bill Carmody, with
disastrous results. The horse was
killed instantly Bill Carmody sus
tained a bad fracture of the left arm
just above the elbow Jack Carmody
was bruised and shook up the buggy
was damaged, and the automobile is
decidedly sickthe radiator was badly
dented, the windshield smashed to
smithereens and one fender is nicely
warped.
The accident occurred just outside
he village limits on the rock road lead
ing west from Prineeton, some time
after 3 o'clock a. m. Mr. Odegard
was returning to Princeton, and he in
formed a Union reporter that he was
traveling along the right-hand side of
the road. He said that when within
a few feet of the approaching rig, the
horse either jumped or was guided in
front of his machine. A collision was
inevitable, and it is fortunate that
no human lives were lost.
