BEING PLANNEDFOR HE EVENT,
Ordinance Wanted to License
Professional Peddlers Here
signed by many merchants and
iltlzens a petition was presented to
the council last evening asking for an
ordinance for the licensing of pro
fessional peddlers Such an ordinance
was Introduced and will be consider
ed during the next week; by the ordi
nance and license committees.
The proposed ordinance draws a
distinction between the professional
peddler and the farmer or producer
who sells his fruit, vegetables, butter,
eggs or other products from house to
house. The petitioner! also made It
plain that they had no objection to
this class of peddling.
However, they declare that the
professional peddler Is unfair compe
tition to the stores who pay taxes,
rent and are culled upon to mako
many contributions to public enter
prises. Moreover, they declared that

The proposed ordinance
declared he would not favor any or- i

against the farmer and was given as
surance that such was not the inten
tion of the petitioners. Councilman
Taylor declared the small farmer
should not be prohibited by license
from purchasing enough produce from
his neighbor to fill out the loud which
he wished to bring to Pendleton. The
majority seemed to favor the idea ot
the ordinance but wished to make Its
language plain so that it would affect
only the class of peddlers to whom
there is objection.
The city also has an ordinance gov

"Queen Muriel with King Joy by hef

which harmonized with her pink cos
tume. The queen's maids followed In
a string of automobiles."
In telling of the beautiful and po

mention to Pendleton's royal pair.
Fxcerpts from the different accounts
are here given:
