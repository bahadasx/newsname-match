Doesn't Care to Shoot the Shutes
J M. Medcalf went to Emerson
last week to look after his tarm
He drove across the country. He
had quite an experience when cross
ing big North River at the Right
mire ford. The water was high, al
most past fording. A ouni man
living near asked Mr Medcalf to
ride with him as far as Philadelpia.
He suggested that as he was lighter
and knew the ford better that lie
drive across and that Mr, Medealf
cross on (he cable. Mr. Medcalf
watched (hem go across and said
it was all the horse could do to
make it There was nothing left fur
him to Jo but climb a tree 'o about
20 feet above the ground where a
wire was fastened. The other end
of the wire was uttnehed to the
foot of a tree on the opposite shore.
The cable was about 300 feet long.
Mr. Medcalf said he experienced
most peculiar sensations as he
whizzed thru the air We suppose
it was not very much enjoyed for
he returned home by way of War
ren. Elected Officers
Thursday evening (he Odd Fel
lews held their regular election.
John Clawson was elected Noble
Grand Jiid Orville Wilson Vice

Commencement Exercises of Hoi y ;
Rosary School
II it be true that "All the world's j
a stage" then this is the season I
when the school children occupy
the boards This is the time for
commencement exercises, class j
meetings and other entertainments, j
In a city that prides itself on its
culture and up-to-dateness it is but j
natural that the pupils of Holy j
Rosary School in their commence j
nient exercises would cover them- i
selves with glory and uphold its
reputation.
In the sing .larly impressive
entertainment at the opera house
Tuesday evening May 30th. that
marked the close of a nappy and
successful school life for the senior
class of 1916 the high standarJ of
excellence set by past performances
was in every respect measured up
to, and the crowd that greeted th e
performers was even larger than
that of other year To say that
the hall was filled to overflowing is
hardly giving an adequate descrip
tion of the situation, for we were
told that even many near the ceiling,
and ou the stairway could not find
a sufficient number of hooks to
hold (hem from slipping. To borrow
an inelegant expression it might
be said that packed sardines had
room to spare in comparison, for
we noticed one man in particular
who wanted (o change the direction
of his gaze, had actually to back
up the aisle, follow his head almost
half way out the window, turn
around outside and asuming the
relative position desired, press for
ward to his place agaiu
The class colors purple and gold
with interwinding folds o. the Stars
and Stripes bordering a stage neatly
decorated, presented a very pretty
spectacle indeed, and the charm of
excellent music from the orchestra
was entirely worthy of tne
occasion.
In our opinion the grand march,
participated in by all the girls of
the school, was (he preuiest
number on the program though it
seemed the senior girls for the
gruce with which they executed
Irish Folk Dances evoke J the
longest rounds of applause.
The reveries of old man Winkle's
stepson, and (he experiences of the
boys in his time made everybody
laugh The class play "Tue Two
Orphans" a drama in two acts, in
setting-i from Scenes in New York,
and the farce entitled "A Confiden
tial Clerk" were exceptionally well
received.
The participants in each deserve
especial mention for their distinct
enunciation and splendid portrayal
of character, particularly she who
loudly, with metallic voice made
such imperative demands on the
gentlest and greatest of all virtues,
though in herself a striking mani
festation of it was not to be observ
ed. Rather we should have said
striking is just (he word to describe
the nunner in which this brow
knit, weather-beaten, double-minded
crusty old money-grabber best
brought her charity into play.
' Miss Virginia Hoar gave a very
itnpressiveand heartfelt valedictory
and (he beloved pastor, father Ryan
after presenting, with fatherly
gratification, the diplomas to the
eleveu graduates, introduced Father
Graham of Hannibal who made
in ' the class address.
