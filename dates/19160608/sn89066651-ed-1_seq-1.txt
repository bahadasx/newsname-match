Greenwell-Munday.
The marriage o Thos. .1.
Greenwell, Jr., of near Caruth
orsville, to Miss Ella May Mun
day of Cairo, 111., which occurred
Monday morning at the six
o'clock services at the local Cath
olic church, marked the culmina
tion of a rather unusual romance.
It is related that some time
d urine; the baling season Mr.
Greenwell happened to the mi&
lortune to get lib. loot badly in
jured while helping to operate a
baling machine on his father's
J arm. As a consequence he had
to go to a hospital, so he spent
several weeks ot the fall and
winter in St. Mary's Hospital at
Cairo. Here he met Miss Mun
day, who acted as his nurse dur
ing his period of detention in the
institution.
M utual admiration soon ripened
into a warmer emotion, and the
little god Cupid shortly had his
victims (irmly entranced. So
Mr. Greenwell recently pre
vailed on his quondam nurse to
enter into a life contract, which
was duly solemnized by Father
U'lirieu Monday, as stated.
The couple were attended by
the groom's brother, Alphonsu,
and a sister of the bride, Miss
Wilma Munday. Following the
ceremony, the party, including
Father O'Brien, repaired to the
larm home of the groom at
Carleton, where a wedding break
fast was served by his mother,
Mrs. T. J. Greenwell, St, at
which was also present the
family of a neighbor, V. N.
Kaniun.
We are informed that the
happy couple have taken up their
residence in a newly furnished
home at Herinandalo farm. The
Democrat joins the many friends
of the couple in extending hearty
congratulations. Car uthersville

Favorable weather. Just enough rain and not too much,
coming seasonable, is bound to make a bumper crop
of everything, and a bumper trade, and we are getting
our share of it, which is notiaable in our cash receipts and

We are very thankful that our pleased customers lull their

We respi'tlfully invite a trial.

Last week the Twice-a-Week
Democrat of Caruthersville came
out under new management, hav
ing at its head the names of
Chilton & Landon, with O. W.
Chilton as editor. i
Mr. Chilton, for several years
was editor and owner of the
Current Local at Van Buren, and
comes to this county well recom
mended, and we arc told that he

Mr. Landon for the past eight
years has heon foreman on the

liked by his acquaintances, and
thoroughly understands the

R. Lacey, he has been the right

ing this valuable publication be
fore the people.
We believe we are to see an im
provement in the Democrat, and
predict that tho Democrat under
the new management will con
tinue to forge ahead.

THINK FOR YOUR
SELF Don't let others think for youdo
it yourself! If someone tells you this
is the best place to trade, don't take his
word for it and go ahead, but come
around, trade here, and figure out for
yourself whether this is the best place
or not. If you think so, keep on
trading; if you don't, we won't get
mad about it.
The man who thinks for himself is the man
who succeeds. Success may be attained in your
