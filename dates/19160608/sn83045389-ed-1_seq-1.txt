was decided that the experiment was

It may not even yet be too late for
the Republicans and I'rogressivea to
bury their differences and agree upon

destruction. All signs to-night, how
ever, ijiS'.-ourage that hope and lead
to the belief that the harmony plans
are about to go up on the rooks.
The Progressives seem determined to
support no candidate but Roosevelt.
The Republicans will not take Roose
velt under any circumstances, and now
have definitely decided to nominate
Hughes. This means a third ticket and
the overwhelming defeat of both fac
tions.
Thero is still a remote chance, that
Roosevelt will decline the Progressive
nomination once he finds that Hughes
stands for all that he himself stands
for, but this chance is so remote that

The budget was passed by the Reich
stag to-day, the only opposition .being
the Socialist votes. There was almo.it
i complete unanimity in providing the
, now war credit of $3,000,000.0(10, only
two Socialists casting their ballots;
I against it. !
Dr. Helfrlchs, Minister of Finance,
told the Reichstag that the war expen-i
| diturcs from January to May, 1916,
? were approximately $503,000,000 a
month. This, he. declared, was extra
ordinarily small, in view of the enor- j
mous quantity of munitions that had!
been provided to carry out the Verdun
I offensive.
The opposition of the Socialists, when
the vote was taken on the budget, had
ho hearing upon the war. The Social
ists have been ngitating for years a
new system of taxation to relieve the
; working man. They have without ex
j ceptlon *otecl against the budget on
j these grounds. The new war credit
' will not be drawn upon, it Is estimated,

Tn the fighting that is going on from
the I'ripet marshes to the Roumanian
frontier the Russians in their big
! offensive movement have dislodged the'
j Teutonic allies from fortified positions
and brought their aggregate of men
captured up to about 41,00ft. They have
also taken seventy-seven puns, 3 34 ma
chine guns and forty-nine bomb
throwers. Among the men made pris
oner are 900 officers.
As an offset to the Russian gains
over the Teutonic allies, however, Con
stantinople asserts that in Asia -Minor,
in the Kope Mountain district's the
Russians have been driven eight kilo
meters eastward from positions e.v
tending over fourteen kilometers, suf
fering losses of more than 1.000 men
killed or wounded. The fighting in
this immediate vicinity covers a front
of over thirty-one mi'.es, with the Turks
! the aggressors, and with the situation
! favorable to them, according to Con
stantinople.
The Germans and the Biltish are
still fighting desperately in the vicinity
oi Yprcs, both sides using their artil
leiy in heavy bombardments and their
infantry tn occasional attacks. In an
infantry attack against the ruined vil
, lage of Hooge. east of Ypres, the Ger
mans succeeded in capturing the Brlt
j ish froiv-line trenches running through

FAIL TO RECOVER HIS BODY
No Reason for Stranger's Act Known
I Here?Was With Companion, With

B. K. Kerr, of Lynchburg:, a tobacco
salesman for a Winston-Salem, N. C.,
f firm, yesterday afternoon committed
suicsd* l?y leaping from Mayo Bridge
! into the water of the James River. The
body was not recovered last night.
No reason for the suicide was learned.
Kerr was thirty-five years old and
lived at 1420 Harrison Street, Lynch
burg. He was employed as a sales
man by the firm of Taylor Brothers,
i Winston-Salem, and had been in Rich
mond several days, stopping at Mur
phy's Hotel.
j Since coming to this city. Kerr had
met \V. H. Carroll, of the Carroll Shoe
Company, of Baltimore, and was room
ing with him at Murphy's. The two
men were in South Richmond yester
day, and met shortly after f> o'clock
' to return to the hotel. Not finding a
car at the South Richmond end of the
Mayo Bridge when they arrived there,
they started to walk.
LKAI'S OVKH HAIL
WITHOUT AW WARNING
? Carroll was commenting on the in
! creasing depth of the river, as a result
of the recent heavy rains, and the
enormous water-power open to this
city as they started to walk across the
bridge. He was not paying particular
attention to Kerr and was gazing up
the river when suddenly he heard a
scraping on the bridge-rail at his right.
Carroll turned in time to see Kerr
scrambling to the top of the rail. The
cry which arose to his lips died away
us he saw his companion balance him
[ self for a bare instant on the rail and
I then plunge off the bridge. Carroll
ran to the rail and reached it in time
i to see Kerr as he disappeared beneath
the water.
At this point the water is consider
ably deeper than in other portions of
the river nearby, and frequently there
is a strong current. It is near the
Virginia Boat Club. The bridge is at
least twenty-live feet above the sur
face of the river at this point.
Carroll spread the alarm, and bridgo
watchmen with several pedestrians en
deavored to locate the body. The po
lice were notified and joined in the
search, but they also were unsuccess
ful.
Police Headquarters learned that
Kerr was a native of Lynchburg, and
at once communicated with the police
of that city.

XE\V YORK, June. 7.?Another Brit

to be the forerunner of a still larger
one, was floated here to-day through
J. P. Morgan & Co. and other bankers.
The money, borrowed on call, is to bo
used to pay for munition purchase., in
this country, it is believed.
The loan, it was stated, was against

Canada.
Local banks have been loaning
money on call to the British govern
ment ever since the beginning of the
war, it was learned to-day. In sonic
im?finccs, American securities on de
posit with J. P. Morgan & Co. have
been used as collateral, pending their
sale.
To-day $4,000,000 more British gold
arrived from Canada. Interior banks
also are sending their reserves to New

call rate, and also in anticipation of
further etli loans to foreign govern

j to Goneral Carranza that the United
I States ami the tie facto (fovfrnmtnt of
Mexico submit thn whole subject of i
, their relations to an international com- '
| mission is being seriously considered !
by the administration.
Such a proposal, if it i* made, will
serve as a reply to the Mexican note
demanding withdrawal of the Aincri
! can troops, and may contemplate ad
justment of many unsettled differences
that for years have embarrassed the
relations of the two nations. Settle- j
ment by a commission is provided for
; expressly by the treaty of IMS. which
provides further that "should such a i
course be proposed by either party, it
shall be acceded to by the other un
| less deemed by it altogether incom
patible with the nature of the difTer
I dice or the circumstances of the case."
President Wilson and General Car
ranza would appoint an equal number
of commissioners under the plan, and
the meeting probably would be held
somewhere outside the territory of
both countries. There was no indica
tion to-night that the President, with
whom rests the final decision as to
whether the proposal shall be made,
had yet reached a decision or that the
reply would go forward within the
I next few days.

?lust what scope would be given Ihe
commissioners has not been worked
, out. In view of the fact that the Mexi
can note demands withdrawal of the
troops as evidence of good faith, it is
' possible that this question would have
to be considered, although prior to the
meetings of the commission no steps
, no ward withdrawal probably would be
taken. Jn addition to military ques
tions. there are economic considera
tions. now greatly complicated by the
European War.
Coming down from bygone years are
, unsettled questions as to certain por
tions of the international boundary,
i Out of th.? Vera Cruz Incident arose
j new problems which must be cleared
up sooner or later. Including disposi
tion of the cutsoin revenues collectcd
by General Pttnston, amounting to
more than }l.OOO.OdO, and now deposit
; ed in this country. There are also
claims for property damage at Vera
Cruz.
Most far-reaching of all, however,
is the question of indemnification for
American lives lost and American prop
erly destroyed or damaged during the
years of revolution in Mexico. Xo at
tempt ever has been made to set an
estimate upon the amount Involved in
these claims; but all are recorded at

toration of order and peace in Mexico
for a day of settlement.

While the commission suggestion
may not propose to go into a broad
discussion of ail these matters, it seems
likely that each will have its bearing
upon the deliberations. Por this rea
son It is thought the membership of
the American commission would be so
i iiosen that the military, commercial
and financial Interests of the nation
would all be represented.
out of such a deliberation, which it
is believed General Carranza would
welcome, officials believe there might
come so definite an understanding as
to the purposes of the Washington
government that it would have Its ef
fect not only in Mexico, but also in
all Latin-American countries, and make
toward a furtherance of the neighbor
ly relations between the nations of'

Name Justice.

Roosevelt Fails to Hold Veto Pow
er?Colonel Will Probably Rc Pro
gressive's Standardbcarer.
CHICAGO, June 7.?More political
leaders are predicting; the nomination
of Justice Charles Kvans Hughes to
night than at any time since the Re
publican National Convention began
to assemble. They declare that unless
the accumulation of overwhelming cir
cumstantial evidence falls to reflect the
situation in its true light, the nomi
nation of the Justice will come even
sooner than has been predicted. The
men who take this view are practical
politicians, whose estimates are based
on careful canvass of the delegates.
The situation is illustrated best by
the fact that conferences between
, lenders to discuss the availability of
different candidates practically have
; ceased, indicating their belief that a
majority of the delegates already have
reached a decision to name JuBtico
! Hughes.
j Convention observers find it impos
sible not to be impressed by the con
fident predictions of these leaders who
say that the Hughes boorn now baa
grown to such formidable proportions
that Colonel Roosevelt no longer holds
the veto power, which, until this af
ternoon, ljad been conceded to him as
part of the program to bring the Re
publican and Progressive parties Into
accord.
TKKXD DEK1MTKLV
IS TOWARD HITCHES
Four days of constant and persist
ent effort to bring the two parties to
gether, in which the personalis of the
nominee was subordinated to harmony,
failed to bring the. results desired, and
the trend from the outset was definite
ly toward the nomination of Justice
Hughes. Had Colonel Roosevelt an
nounced during this period that he
would not support the Justice, the lead
ers w?ro prepared to turn to any 0110
of the regular Republican candidates.
The Colonel remained silent, however,
and because the managers of other can
didacies had fostered the Hughes boom
for the purpose of eliminating Roose
velt us a possibility, it grew, prodi
giously, and even a combination of tho
favorite sons' strength was powerless
to check it. The reason for this was
that the candidacy of no other Repub
lican made any progress, and delegates
pledged to favorite sons found no other
presidential possibility but Justice
Hughes, to whom they could turn their
strength. Justice Hughes thus natur
ally became the. choice of practically
all delegates instructed for others.
They became eager to go to him as
soon as they could secure release from
their pledges.
The Hughes managers lo-night reit
erated their claim that he will have
about 300 votes on the first ballot.
Frank Ji. Hitchcock, spokesman fur
the Hughes followers, said there would
be no attempt to nominate the Justice
on the first ballot, and that It was
their deslrw to have all the favorite
son delegates deliver their compli
mentary votes. He believed, however,
that the second ballot, with the release
of many delegates from their obliga
tions, would swell the Hughes votes
to such proportions that his nomina
tion would almost certainly he made
on tho third ballot. Many of tho
Hughes supporters were even more op
timistic. and said they thought that
before the result of the second ballot
was announced the drift would bo ap
parent to all delegates, and there
would be enough changes of votes to
bring a nomination on the second bal
lot.
WHITMAN TO I'l.ACR
III (.IIKS IX \u.1II\ATIOX
The Hughes managers expect Ari
zona, second on the roll of States, to
yield to New York, so Governor Whit
man may place Justice Hughes in nom
ination. Alabama's delegation is di
vided and, having no candidate to of
fer, is expected to pass when the State,
the first on the roll, is called.
When tho Hughes tide became ap
parent late to-night, many inquiries
were made of those who are supposed
to speak for litm as to whether his
acceptance. In case of nomination, j
would be In any sense contingent upon 1

just two hours, and in its lark of
I demonstration, or outbursts of any

nated McKinle.v and Roosevelt.
? For one hour and twenty minutes
Senator Harding', the temporary chair
man. delivered a carefully prepared
speech. punctuated in the telling points
with brief periods of handclapping and
I applause, but at no time did a demon

minute.
Tho convention was twentv-flve
minutes behind the hour, arranged for
its assembly, but when Chairman Hllles
| of the national committee, brought,
down his gavel at 11.25 o'clock it
moved quickly and with precision un
til adjournment at 1:25.

The hour for assembling was set for

served for the delegates, and hundreds
of seats on the floor and in the gal
leries? were empty. Chairman Hllles
eventually gave signs of calling the
convention to order, and the uniform

the delegates into their places.
