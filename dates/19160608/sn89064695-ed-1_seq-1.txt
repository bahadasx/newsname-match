Senator Clapp is evidently a
Koosevelt supporter, tor he was
recently heard to say that this
country wanted a man for presi
dent who has some red blocd hi
his veins.
The candic'a es for Congress in
the Sixth Congressional District
are all sawing wood, but accord
ing to reports it look-i as though
either Ed Rogers or C. B. Buck
man will be the nominee.
C, C. Daniels, brother of the
secretary of th navy, is rep rted
to be in the employ of a New
York firm which obtains 1 irgec
tracts to furnish iroD and oth^r
material for the building of war
ships. An ineompe'ent man is
fortunate in having a pull that has
landed him into a position which
pays a salary probably very much
larger than the one he received
from the government. O. C.
Daniels is certainly making the
best of his opportunities as the
brother of the secretary of the
navy, and this should be sufficient
evidence that he was not a safe
person to settle the land matters
of this reservation.
Another prominent man in this
state who is an outspoken sup
porter of Roosevelt is C. A. Cong
don of Duluth. In an interview
with the Minneapolis Journal last
J? week, Mr. Congdon, in his usual
direct way, said it would be a
great mistake to not nominate
Roosevelt and to nominate Hughes
as the Republican presidential can
didate. Mr. Congdon is right.
Justice Hughes is a very high
grade man and no doubt makes a
better justice of the United States
Supreme Couit than he would a
President of the United States.
President Taft had been a judge
of a court and on account of the
experience during his administra
tion the Lord save this country
from another such experience.
Death Of James J. Hill.
wa
c.-.-
James J. Hill, the noted rail
road builder and financier, died at
his residence in St. Paul last we^k
blood poisoning.
Many noted men have died in
the recent past, but none of them
have been known among the In
dians of the northwest, and espec
ially among the Chippewas, except
Jim Hill as he was more familiarly
known.
Mr. Hill was employed by Chip
^pewa mixed bloods for a number
of years after he came from Cana
da to this state, and he traveled porting Mr. Anderson
from St. Paul to Fort Gary, nowi If Mr. Steenerson had always
known as Winnipeg, frequently stood for what is right and fair

UNITED STATES
SENATOR MOSES
E, CLAPP.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
should not waste or lose a vote for
Senator Clapp at the coming prim
ary election, and they should be
sure that they make no mistake in
marking their ballots by voting
for more than one person for Un
ited States senator.
Every Indian who has visited
Washington on business for him
self or for the tribe will appreci
ate what a great loss to the cause

of the Chippewas it would be if
Senator Clapp should be defeated
at this time, for this is a crucial
stage in the history of Indian
affairs.
The Chippewas have made great
headway in getting what they are
entitled to, more so than any other
tribe in the United States, and this*
is all due to Senator Clapp's assist
ance. The amendments in the In
dian appropriation act oassed last
month by Congress, are all due to
Senator Clapp, except the Red
Like amendment, and entitles him
to the full support of the Chippe
was. There are rumors of per
sons upon this reservation who
will not support Senator Clapp be
cause he has friends among the
faction to which they do not be
long notwithstanding the fact that
some of these persons owe him a
debt of gratitude for assisting
them.
A Chippewa who is a true friend
to the interests of the Chippewas
of Minnesota will not allow his
pergonal prejudices against his
opponents to control him but will
vote for the man who has favored
him and his tribe and protected
their interests at all times.

ship of a country that is not in

Representative Steenerson and
the ten other congressmen who
voted as he did regarding the
questions that were involved in
the McLenmore resolution voted
as their constituents no doubt
wanted them to vote while Sen
ator Nelson voted contrary to
these wishes.
Representative Steenerson has
not much to fear regarding his
vote on the McLenmore resolu
tion, but there are other things
which he has to account for.
The Chippewa Right Of
Nomination Act.
While the Indian delegations of
her tribes were busily dicussin
the Johnson Right of Nomination
Bill, and other similar bills, the
Chippewa delegation, with iho as
sistar.ee of Senator Clapp, succeed
ed in securing the pissage of sm
amendment which will, to all in
tents and purposes, be s f. ir to
tne Chippewas of Minnesota as
the Right of Nomination Bill
would be if it is passed by Con
gress.
If the Indian office at Washing
ton will not ignore the law, all the
positions in the Chippewa Indian
service in this state, the salaries of
which are being paid from Chip
pewa tribal funds, shall be filled
by members of the tribe. I is up
to these members to take the
proper steps to secure the posi
tions.
In order that there shall be an
equal distribution of the positions
the General Council should estab
lish and seek to enforce a rule
which will not place whole families
in the Chippewa Indian service to
the exclusion of other worthy per
sons, and in this way keep the
service and the new Chippewa
policy in good repute.
John 6. Morrison Jr. For
Superintendent.
During his incumbency as presi
dent of the Chippewa General
Council John (i. Morrison Jr. has
shown himself to be impartial and
efficient, and for this reason it is
believed he would make an impar
tial and efficient superintendent of
the White Earth Reservation.
Mr. Morrison is a middle aged
and conservative man whose sym
pathies are thoroughly with his
people, the Chippewas of Minne
sota, and he could be relied upon
to do what the amendment of the
Indian appropriation act of this
year provides, to give the mem
bers of the Chippewa tribe the
preference in filling the positions
in the Chippewa Indian Service
the salaries of which are being
paid from the tribal funds of the
Chippewas of Minnesota.
He would undoubtedly do all in
his power to have the amendment
referred to fulfilled, and prevent
it, if possible, from being a fail
ure.
Much will depend upon the
Chippewas of Minnesota iu caus
ing Congress and the administra
tion to inaugurate a new policy to
wards the Indians of the country,
and if the policy of giving Indians
the preference to fill the positions

Indians Are Suspicious.
Mrs. Lizzie A. Richards, of
Stanh y, N. Mex., apropos of a
recent news item in the Pathfinder,
writes saying she has been an em
ployee of the Indian service for 2*2
yearsseven of which were passed
with no white person nearer than
10 miles. In that time, she says,
she has "learned a great deal
about the Indians, and also a little
about the Indian bureau officials."
She adds that "not all who are
working in the Indian service *TS
working for the Indians The
intent ion of the government is to
treat the Indians wiih honesty and
fidelity, but many appointees to
the Indian service think too much
of their own selfish interests and
too little about the welfare of the
Indians, she in'imates. Hence if
the Indians are sometimes suspic
ious of the "Great White Father's"
agents and emissaries, they cannot
be blamed.The Pathfinder.

FORMER DECISION.
Last Monday the Court of Claims
handed down a deci-ion sustaining
its former decision in favor of the

stubbornly resisted by the Depart-

hoped it has reached its last stajre
and that the Mille Lac Chippewas
will finally receive what they are
entitled to under treaties, and that
the appropriation will be made at
