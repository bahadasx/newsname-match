VICTORY FOR HUGHES
Colonel RoosoTolt's Frlcndn Who Ap.

II Is Too Lnto-rollllcal Tro
phots Foresee Landslide
Now York Son.
7 Former Senator
Jackson, ot Maryland, Ilopubllcan na
tional committeeman irom inai biuic,
tonight sent a tolcgram to uoionoi
Knrmnvplt nt OvtitAr Dav urcliiR him
to como to Chicago In. tho Interest of
harmony and announclnfj ho would
do hla utmost In caso of an nccoptanco
to havo Mr. Roosovolt givon tno priv
llcgo ot tho convention floor.
Mr. Jackson's tolcgram reads:
"Tim nntlonal Interest domands tho
comnleto reunion of tho Republican
party which unhappily divided In
nineteen twelve. 1 oencvc ims can
bo accomplished by a more perfect
iirwWntnnillnrr lintwron VOll and thO
Ilopubllcan convention now assembled
I thcreforo most earnestly urge you
to como to Chicago Immediately, ad
dress this convention, and to make
common causo In our deliberations. If
vnn will Inrilr.nte vour wIlllllKness to
tako this courso I will uso my utmost
endeavors to sccuro for you tno priv
Ilege of tho convention floor."
Chicago , Juno 7 More political
loaders are predicting the nomination
of Justloo Charles Evans llugnos to
night than at any tlmo since tho Ite
publican convention began to nssom
ble. Thoy declaro that unless tho ac
cumulation ot overwhelming clrcum
stantlal ovidenco proves falso to the
situation In Its true light, Un nomt
nation of tho Justice will como sooner
than has been predicted. Tho men
who take this view aro practical poll
tlclans who do not make estimates tin
less they are based on carotui can
vass of tho dolccatcs.
The situation Is Illustrated best by
tho fact that conferences between the
leaders to discuss tho availability of
different candidates practically have
ceased Indicating their belief that the
delegates have reached a dlcislon to
nominate Justice Hughes.
Four days of constant effort and
persistent effort to bring the two par
ties together In which tne personality
of the nomlneo was subordinated to
harmony, failed to bring tno results
desired and tho trend from the outset
was definitely toward tho nomination
ot Justice Hushes. Had Colonel
Koosovelt announced earlier In this
uerlod that ho would not support tho
Justice, tho leaders wcro prepared to
turn to anyone or tno reguia. uepuo
llcnn candidates.
Colonel ltemalus Silent
The Colonel romalncd silent and bo-
causo tho managers of other candi
dates had fostered the Hughes boom
for tho purpose of eliminating Roose
velt os a possibility, it grow nroui
gously and oven combination of the
favorite sons was powerless to check
It, Justice Hughes thus naturally be
came tho choice of practically an
delegates Instructed for othors. Thoy
becamo eager to go to him as soon as
thoy could sccuro release from their
badges.
It seems nractlcally certain that they
acaln nominate Roosevelt ns their
chief standard bearor and It Is not at
all unlikely thnt Governor Hiram
Johnson also will bo drafted, so that
their ticket will bo the same as In
1012 Roosevelt and Johnson.
The more conservative representa
tives of tho Progressive party hopo to
forestall option In their convention
until Friday.
The effort to deity making a nom
ination is becauso a few of tho leaders
still profess that there Is some pros
pect of reaching an agreement wun
the Republican managers.
Harding Sounds Keynote
Tho Republican national convention
assembled in the Coliseum today
heard a keynoto bdcccU dollv-ircd by
Senator Warren O. Harding, of Ohio,
perfected an organization and ad
journed until 11 o'clock tomorrow
morning. It all took Just two hours
and lack .of demonstrations or out
bursts of any kind and Its Btrict at
tention to tho business In hand was
romlnlscent of tho Philadelphia con
vention In 1900 that nominated Mc-
Klnloy and Roosevelt.
For ono hour and twonty minutes
Senator Harding, tho tomporary chair
man, dollvored a carefully prepared
speech, puntuotcd In the tolling points
with brief periods ot hand clapping
and applause, but at no tlmo did a

a ralnuto by tho watch.

Its assembly, hut when Chairman
Hilles of the Republican national
committee, brought down his gavel at
11:25 o clock it moved quietly nna
with precision until adjournment at
1-23.
Tho assembling hour was sot for 11
o'clock, but there was no semblance
of order at that time and no ono mado
any pretenso ot securing It. Tho dele
gates stood about tho floor and talked
tho spectators overflowed Into the
spaces reserved for tho delegates and
hundreds of Boats on tho floor and In
tho galleries woro empty. Finally
Chairman Hilles gave signs ot calling
U10 convention to ordor and the unl
farmed police began moving about
urging tho delegates Into tholr places,
Finally at 11:28 0 clock, Chairman
Hilles brought down the gavel with
three resounding whacks and quiet set
tied down over tho big hall.
"The hour of 11 oclock having ar
rived and a Quorum being present",
said ho, "the convention will be In
order. Paraphrasing u remark made
by tho lato President MelClnloy, this
is a year whatever may havo been
true ot past years whon politics Is
patriotism and patriotism is politics,
Therefore the audlenco will please
rlso and sing two versos of America"

Go Home To Your Cool Porch
No matter how hot the day, your porch will be cool and restful if it is protected from the sun by
1916 Model Vudor Reinforced Porch Shades
Vudor Safety Wind Devices prevent Shades from flapping in the wind and take all wind pressure
off the Shades. New VUDOR Cord Slides do away with galvanized or iron pulleys and make Shades
roll up easily. We use Vudor permanent oil stain, instead of the cheap, "change color" paint that is
used on imitations.
Learn how at little cost you can convert your porch into a shady, secluded living room or a
breezy, out-of-door sleeping room.
Phone any time and we will send a man to measure your porch and tell you exactly what it will
cost to screen your porch with the best shade in the market.
