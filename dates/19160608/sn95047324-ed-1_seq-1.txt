American Troops are Being Ar
ranged for Encounter
LED RAIDS OF A YEAR AGO
Will Pursue La Rosa Into Mexico
If He Cannot be Captur
ed Otherwise
San Antonio, Texas General
Funston announced Tuesday that
he had what appeared to be posi
tive information that Louis D. La
Rosa was marching from a point
south of Laredo, in the direction
of the border with the evident in
tention of raiding the country
somewhere west of Rio Grande
City. ,
There are not now in that, dis
trict enough American troops to
prevent De La Rosa and his men
from crossing.
General William A. Mann, com
manding the American forces in
that district with headquarters at
Laredo, has reported to General
Funston that he is taking such
measures as possible to strength
en the patrol towards the east
and to guard Laredo.
Will Follow Into Mexico
Other than that the. bandits
were comparatively near the bor
der and moving in the general di
rection of Zapata county, it was
not known when or at just what
point Do La Rosa intends to
strike.
It was estimated that, in the e
vent the raiders cross the boun
dary before reinforcements ar
rive, they will be pursued into
Mexico if not captured in Texas.
De La Rosa was one of the lead
ers of the group that directed the
raids near Brownsville a year ago.
Since then he has been a fugitive
in his own country with a price
of $1,000 on his head, offered by
Texas.
The information that reached
General Funston indicated that
De La Rosa would not be more
than two or three days at the
most in getting to the border, it

tory in Zapata county little in
jury to the residents is anticipat
ed because, with the exception of
one or two families, all the resi
dents are Mexicans. From the
farmers a large number of horses
and mules could be taken, howev
er. General Mann has at Laredo
and in its vicinity one squadron
of cavalry, a regiment of infan
try and a battery of artillery.
Silage for Milk Production
This bulletin gives the results
obtafned from a comparison of
xorghum silage and Japanese cane
silage for milk production. Ten
cows were used in the test. These
ten cows were divided into two
lots of five each. The experi
ment was begun January 18, 1916,
and continued for seventy-three
days, closing March 30, 1916. The
test was divided into four periods
of sixteen days each with three
days between each period for the
purpose of changing feeds.
The first period extended from
January 18, to February 2, 1916.
During the first period the cows
in Lot 1 were fed the following
daily ration : cottonseed meal 3.8
pounds; bran 7.6 pounds; and
sorghum silage 15 pounds. Dur
ing the same period the cows in
Lot II were given a daily ration
of cottonseed meal 3.8 pounds;
bran 7.6 pounds; and Japanese
cane silage 15 pounds.
During the second period,
which extended from February 6
to February 21, the cows in Lot I
fnnfirMl trip Iflilv rntinna crivan '
Lot II, the first period, and the
cows in Lot II, received the, ra
tions given Lot I in the first per
iod. During the third period each
lot of cows received the same ra
tions as in the first period.
During the fourth period each
lot of cows received the same ra
tions as in the second period.
The sorghum silage ration pro
duced 539.72 gallons of milk at a
total feed cost of 12.1 cents a gal
lon. The Japanese cane silage
ration produced 509.74 gallons of
milk at a total feed cost of 12.8;
TRAMMEL! LEADS FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR
AND CATTS TOR GOVERNOR IN FIRST CHOICE VOTES
cents a gallon. This makes a dif
ference of 0.7 of a cent a gallon
in favor of sorghum silage.
The value of the milk at 30
cents a gallon from the sorghum
silage was $161.92. The net value
after deducting the cost of feed
was $96.38. .The value of the
milk produced, by the Japanese
cane silage was $152.92. The net
value after deducting the cost of
the feed was $87.38, or a differ
ence of $9 in favor of sorghum
silage.
Aside from the milk yield a rec
ord of the weights of each cow
was taken at the beginning of the
experiment and at the close of
each period. The weights of each
cow varied but little during the
experiment. All cows made a
slight gain over the average
weights at the beginning. This
would indicate that there was no
difference between these two. ra
tions in maintaining the animal's
initial weight.
The results of this test indicate
that Japanese cane silage is not
quite equal to sorghum silage for
milk production. This difference
may perhaps be due to the fact
that Japanese cane produces no
grain.- Jno. M. Scott, Florida

Omission of a Letter
A proof reader, anent the im

each made absurd by the omis

"The conflict was dreadful and
the enemy was repulsed with
great laughter."
"When the president's wife en

ed Results of the State-Wide Primary of Tuesday Slow
Count Makes Definite News Hard to Get
Returns from all parts of the
State in the Democratic primary

Tampa up to 3 o'clock yesterday
morning with' all the uncertainty
incident to partial counts of leng
thy ballots and the absolute im
possibility of determining the ver
dict of the potent second choice
vote, indicate the following state
wide results, based entirely on
first choice votes:
Congressional
United States Senator: Park
Trammell is far in the lead, with
Wall second, Bryan third, Gil
christ fourth. Trammell has led
in all sections of the State.
First District: Every indica
tion is that II. J. Diane has been
nominated for ' Congress, to suc
ceed S. M. Sparkman, "who has
held the office twenty-two years.
Drane, on the figures in hand, has
carried Polk, Sumter, Pasco, Her
nando, Citrus, DcSoto, Manatee
and Lee counties, leaving to the
incumbent Hillsborough, Pinellas
and Lake. In Hillsborough coun
ty, Drane ran a remarkable race
and actually carried important
precincts against Mr. Sparkman.
Estimates of Diane's, majority
went as high as 2,000.
Second District: Frank Clark
renominated without opposition.
Third District: J. II. Smith
wick appears to be the winner,
not only on first choice votes, but
on the assurance of second 'choice
preference. ' '
Fourth District: The race is
very close between W. J. Sears,
incumbent, and Forrest Lake of
Sanford, with the chance's favor
ing Lake.

Cromwell Gibbons over J. T. G.
Crawford.
Governor: S. J. Catts is far in
the lead in first choice votes, run
ning ahead of all other candidates
by from ten to one to two to one.
In tue event second choice votes
are necessary to a choice, W. V.

has a chance to overcome the
Catts lead. Farris, Hudson and
Wood are distant trailers. Even
in Wood's home county, Pinellas,
Catts is contesting closely with
him.

tween II. Clay Crawford and A.
P. Jordan is close.
Comptroller: A. J. Angle is
undoubtedly winner in this race.
Tin' second man is Ernest Amos.
Theasurer: J. C. Luning has
swept the State against his op
ponent, J. S. Griner.
School Superintendent: The
race is close; South Florida coun
ties give Kelley a handsome lead,
but reports from other sections
indicate big vote for Sheats.
Supreme Court: Justice Cock
rell appears to have been nomi
nated over Jefferson Browne, of
Key West.
Railroad Commissioner: Tho
race is between Wells and Dunn,
with an evident leaning toward
Wells.

FLORIDA YOUNG WOMEN'S
CAMP CONFERENCE
Varied and Helpful Program
With Prominent Speakers
The Florida Young Women's
Camp Conference which is to be

roe, opposite Sanford, promises to
be one of the best gatherings for
young women ever hejd in the

til June 30th.
No more beautiful nor appro
priate place could have been se
lected. The fine hotel affords a-
bundant room for the girls, while
the clear waters of the lake in
vite the campers to sports unlim
ited. Tennis, croquet, and kind
red land games will be enjoyed,
while boating, fishing, swimming,
hikes, picnics and all those pleas
ures so dear to the. American girl
are being planned.
The entire conference will be
under splendid discipline. Miss

St., Jacksonville, is Registrar.and
names of prospective campers
should be sent to her. Girls are
expected to bring only plain
clothes, bathing suits, tennis rack
ets, musical instruments, etc.
Even to the Seeds on the Sea
Everybody in Miami is well ac
quainted with cocoanuts, or ought
to be, yet how many know why
a cocoanut has three eyes? Luth
er Burbank explains it this way
Cocoanuts, he notes, generally
grow at the edge of the sea or riv
ers. The nuts are surrounded
with a thick husk with a water
proof covering so that when they
drop into the water they will
float. In floating the three eyes
are always on top.
Once the cocoanut is in the wa
ter, Nature gets busy. From one
of the eyes there comes a shoot
which develops broad leaves like
sails. The wind catches the sails
and wafts the cocoanut on a jour
ney sometimes many miles long.
As it sails the other two eyes de
velop roots, which at first grow a-
long the fibers of the woody husk.
In good season the cocoanut is
swept upon another shore, ' per
haps on another island. The roots
imbed themselves in the soft
earth, the sail becomes the trunk,
and a cocoanut palm is growing
where none grew before!
Fringing many a Honda Key
are these cocoanuts which were
launched as free sea rovers from
some other shore. Whispering
through their graceful fronds are
breezes telling of other seed-craft
which are traveling every day to
new homes seed-craft which are
vastly more marvelous than any
work of man, and which some
how, somewhere, were thought
out by the Master Mind ond de
signed as was the cocoanut with
its "three eyes," so wisely plan
