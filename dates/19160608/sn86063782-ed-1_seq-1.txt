BRITISH MINISTER OF WAR WAS
GOING TO RUSSIA ON SECRET
MISSION.
ENGLAND'S MOST NOTABLE
FIGURE ON BATTLEFIELD
Admiral Jellicoe Officially Reports to
King George the Sinking of the
Hampshire, Another Big Liner of
Great Britain.
London. ? Admiral Jellicoe, commander
of the British Grand Fleet,
lias reported to the admiralty that the
British cruise]; Hampshire with Earl
Kitchener and his staff aboard has
been lost off the West Orkneys. Admiral
Jellfeoo's report to the admiralty
follows:
"I have to report with deep regret
that His Majesty's ship Hampshire
Captain Herbert J. Savill, R. N.. with
Lord Kitchener and his staff on bbard,
was sunk last night at about 8 p. m.,
to the west of the Orkneys, either by
a mine or a torpedo,
i "Four boats were seen by observerh
vers on Bhore to leave the ship. The

p seas were ruining. Patrol vessels and
E d^atroyers at once proceeded to the
P spot and a party was ser.t along the]
K coast to search, but only some bodies J
p and a capsized boat have been found
up to the present. As the whole
I shore has been searched from the
seaward, I greatly fear that there ie
little hope of there being 8ny survivors.
"No report has yet been -eceived
from the search party on shore.
"H. M. S. Hampshire was on her
way to Russia." j
Earl Kitchener was appointed seer#
tary of state for war on August 8
1914, a few days after Great Britain's
declaration of war on Germany. He
was regarded as England's greatest
soldier, and the decision of the gov
ernment to entrust him with supreme
direction of the war was received
with unanimous approval,
war are recognized universally.
Notwithstanding the criticism directed
against Karl Kitchener his
great accomplishments during the
As the war progressed and Great
Britain's deficiencies in certain direc
tions. particularly in regard to the
shortage of artillery ammunition, be
came apparent. Earl Kitchener was
subjected to sever criticism, led by
Lord Northcliffe. The secretary was
charged with responsibility for failure
to foresee the extraordinary demand
for heavy shells and as a result the
ministry of munitions was formed
with Lloyd George at its head.
Earl Kitchener's responsiuiiiue?
were further lessened by the appointment
of General Sir William Robertson
as chief of the imperial staff in
December of la-t year. It was report
ed at that time that friction had arisen
between Earl Kitchener and Field
Marshal French, then In command of
the British forces in France. Shortly
after the appointment of General Rob
ertson. Field .Marshal French relinquished
his command.
There have been i o recent reports
of Earl Kitclienei - movements. He
was last mentioned in tlie cable dispatches
of Friday when he went to
Westminster palace to be questioned
by members of the house of commons,
who were nor sa'isfle-'. with ihe conduct
of the war. No intimation was
given that ite intended to leave England.
The Hampshire has been in use as
a scout boat ui*: for carrying officials
on various mis having ample accommodfirons
for the latter mrpose.
She was too old to take a p!ac-? on the
fghi lug line.
NEW COUNTY ACT IS VALID
Judge Moore Rules on Ground of "III
Shaped County" Clause?Baok to
Higher Court.
Chester.?Judge Ernest Moore of
Lancaster, to who? the supreme
court referred the proceeding brought
by Septimus Massey et al. to restrain
the Catawba county commissioners
from ordering a survey and contraot- j
ing other expense in connection with
the new county on the ground that the
"ill shaped county" aot clearly prohibits
a county of such shape and the 1
survey would be unwarranted and unnecessary,
handed down a decree in
which he sustained the attorneys reprp?ftnHnr
the old counties and de
clared the act of the legislature under
attack to be sound law and not in conflict
with the constitution. The case
will be taken to the supreme court on
appeal.
Judge Moore's decree upholds the
contentions of J. H. Marion at every
point.
First. Col. Marion declared that the
language of the constitution on the
subject of creating new countlse is
permissory, the use of the word "may"
being in its ordinary acceptance and
implying the right of the general assembly
to safeguard the general rules
and directions for erecting new counties
by adding to the same such salutary
rules and regulations as might
appear needful. Judge Moore concurred
in this interpretation and ruled accordingly.
The claim that even if the language
of the constitution on the subject of
erecting new counties is mandatory,
the legislature has the right to substitute
a method for the general method
provided was also upheld.
The third point, citing the police
power vested in the legislature and
other bodies to guard the rights of
citizens by the enactment of laws in
conflict with general rights vouchsafed
by the constitution, if such appear
necessary, was also sustained.
Judge Moore then takes up the argument
advanced by Col. A. L. Gaston,
in regard to the constitutional
convention's attitude towards the
creation of new counties, gad disposed
of the argument of Catawba county
proponents to the effect that a provision
in regard to the shape of new
counties was voted down by the con
ventlou by showlnf that this was done
in order that the legislature, to whom
m representatives of tha peoptaauch
viRinn mm* fflSSt not Be
hampered in their treatment of- the
subject. Mr. Welch dwelt upon the
convention's failure to incorporate
into the constitution a provision as
t othe shape of the new oounttes, and
Col. Gaston replied to the argument
in the manner upheld by Judge Moore.
Te Entertain Firemen.
Orangeburg.?The time for the state
Firemen's Association meeting to he
heM in this city is drawing oloee. This
convention will be held in Orangeburg

left Spartanburg for Columbia after
having spent the greater part of two
days in a whirlwind campaign of the

upper part of the state, the governor's
time was fully occupied. He delivered
eight addresses in the county during

Mr. Ragsdale since January 1 Riga Is
one of the most important seaports of
Russia. Mr. Alford will spend about
two weeks with his relatives in South
Carolina and then eall from New "** "k

Albert D. Oliphant. assistant secretary
of the state board of charities and
corrections, spent one day in Lexington
pursuing the duties of his office.
He said Lexington is building some
of the best highways to be found in
any county in the state.
The sixth annual convention of the
Tri-State Water and Light Association
of the Carollnas and Georgia will

Temporary Chairman and Dellv- jj
ere the Keynote Speech
Chicago, June 7.?The Republican;
party opened its great quadrennial!
show?the national convention?to- ,
day before a capacity houae. Despite
the fact that the proceedings of the
first session were to be only prelim
lnary formalities, the people flocked
to the Coliseum by the thousand and
poured through the many entrances
In solid streams for hours. When
Charles D. Hlllet, chairman of the na
aitonal committee, arose at eleven
- - - - *<-- 1 ?.u
o'clock ana took up mo gavci i?_>
the convention to order there was not
one vacant seat in the immense structure.
It was a fine setting for an important
event. The Coliseum was dec
orated as never before, with flags and
bunting draping the girders and galleries
and covering all bare spots on
the end walls. Up in a gallery at the
eouth end of the hall a brass band t
was pouring forth patriotic and popu
lar airs. Back of the speaker's ros- 1
trum, where sat Mr. Hilles and his t
working force of 35 men, were group- f
ed many members of the diplomatic
corps who had come on from Wash *
lngton, and the distinguished guests' of
the convention, among them all
living exchairmen of Republican na- 1
tional conventions. 3
In the body of the ball, directly in
front of the speaker's stand, were the
991 delegates gathered about their
state standards, and back of them 991
alternates. Just below the rostrum
and on both sides of it were the 425
working newspaper men, and in the
galleries all around the hall were the 1
thousands of spectators who had been 1

Convention Begins lIusTneSs^^^
Mr. Hilles was heartily applauded j
when he stood before the throng <
gavel in hand. He spoke but briefly ,
In calling the great gathering to order,
and called on Rev. John Timothy
Stone, pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian
church of Chicago, to deliver the
invocation. Dr. Stone's eloquent and f
impressive prayer was followed by i
the reading of the call for the con- ,
vention by Jaines B. Reynolds of Mas (
sachuetts. secretary of the national
committee.
Mr. Hilles then called for nominations
for temporary chairman. Of
course the selection of United States
Senator Charles Warren Harding of
Ohio for that position had been all set

| then turned to the topic of American|
ism. Here he once more let his eloquence
have full play, and his call for
loyalty, devotion and love for the
United States on the part of every one
of its citizens was answered by a roar
of cheers.
"Verily, it is good to be an American.
And we may rejoice to be Re- j
publicaiiB," he eoncludedwd.
When the band music that burst
forth at the end of Senator Harding's j
speech was over and the assemblage j
quieted down again, the other tempo-1
rary officers' were nominated and elec- j
ted. and the chairmen of the various \
state delegations were called on to i

Harding Is an imposing figure,

Chairman Harding's Address.
Chairman Harding launched at once
Into his "keynote" speech, and did not
belie his reputation for eloquence and
deftness of phrase, He began with a
warm plea for harmony in the party
ranks, coupled with the confident assertion
that such harmony already was
an assured fact. With unctuous sentences
lie skillfully oiled the way for
the smooth return of those who left
the party four years ago to follow the
Bull Moose standard, and he declared
to them and to the world that he did
liot Deneve mere a ica..,, .
tionary Republican among the delegates.
As might have been expected, Mr.
Harding early in his address took up
the subject of national defense. His
utterances on this topic were reasonably
emphatic and in line with the
preparedness sentiment that has been
spreading over the land. Our national
unselfishness has been proved since
the groat war broke out, he said, and
our national weakness in defense revealed.
The foreign policy of the
Democratic administration, both in relation
to Kurope and in the matter of
Mexico, was dealth with in a few caustic
sentences, and the plan to "turn
loose" the Philippines also was scored.
Thes peaker devoted some attention
to the need, front a Republican point
ill inc.' recent auuuqu ivccuug ui me
Souttf-Eastern Underwriters Association-at
Atlantic City aad the subject
was. referred to only In <a most casual
way by a few of the delegates.
While all company officials deplore
the necessity of ceasing operations in
thcstate and are a unit in expressing
sympathy for the plight of local agents
and those asstireds who will inevitably
suffer financial loss through failure
t" secure adequat? insurance,
there is a distinct feeling of indifference
among them as to When they
may be made by the authoriteis toward
that end.
It seems patent that a special session
of the legislature must be called
before long to settle the question decisively,
and In such a way as to permit
the companies to do business
again in the state under laws that will
assure them a fair opportunity of
gaining a profit that has been denied
them for many years.
Politics are expiring every day and
in most cases the assured is unable to
secure renewals of insurance except
in part. An instauce of this kind will
shortly present a seribus situation to
the owners of Hampton Terrace, the
big tourist hotel at North Augusta,
S. C. The insurance on this structure,
it is understood, will expire in June.
The management wishes renewals on
about $300000 insurance, but there
appears little likelihood that more
than $40,000 to $50,000 can be secured.
While this is a big risk it is only one
of all sizes that will be in the same
plight within a short time.

Robs Southerners of All Grounds of
Hospitality to North.?Leaves Them
Nothing wlh Which to Bargain for
Dnuj*p_Mav Attemnt to Reinstate

Shanghai. ? The opinion was expressed
here that the death of President
Yuan Shi Kai of the Chinese republic
might have an unfortunate effect
on political conditions in China
and that it was most inopportune for
the southern provinces. Negotiations
were on the eve of successful completion
for a basis of the retirement of
Yuan Shi Kai in favor of Li YuanHung,
the vice president and the formation
of a convention cabinet in which
the southerners expected to obtain a
predominating position. The southerners
were to guarantee the safety of
Yuan Shi Kai and his monarchist partisans.
The death of the president, which
under the constitution will result in
the succession of Li Yuan-Hung, robs
the southerners of all grounds of hostility
to the north, but it also leaves
them nothing with which to bargain
for power. Premier Tuan Chi-Jui,
supported by troops, may be able to
set up a quasi-military government,
in which the southerners, if represented
at all, will be in the minority.
Chang Soulin, governor of Mukden
province, and the former Manchu
general, Shang Shun, may make an
attempt to reinstate the Manchu dynasty.
It is also believed that Feng
Kao-Cheng, governor of Nanking, aspires
to t>.e presidency.

RUSSIANS SUCCESS ON LONG
BATTLE FRONT UNBROKEN
Plentiful Supply of Ammunition and
Men Reported.?Artillery Duels
at Verdun. , |
From the Prlpet River southward I
to the Rumanian frontier, the Russians,
according to Petrograd, are con- !
tinuing to develop successes against
the Germans and Austrians. In the j
fights along this front of some 150 j
miles the Russians already have made j
prisoners of 480 officers and more
than 25,000 men and captured 37 guns !
an dmore than 50 machine guns.
In this offensive, which is declared
to be a carefully co-ordinated movement,
the Russians are said to have
a plentiful supply of ammunition and
men, and with the roads now in good
condition their manocuvers arc expected
to develop swiftly. The number
of the Teutonic Allies facing the Russians
is reported to amount to about
000,000 men.
Since the repulse of two German
infantry attacks between Fort Vaux
and Damloup, the fighting in the Verdun
region has again developed into
artillery duels, with the Fort VauxDamloup
sector the center of the greatest
violence. No material gains for
either side are reported.
GOETHALS SAID TO BE
DESIROUS OF RETIRING
Washington.?Major General Goethals,
governor of the Canal Zone, conferred
with Secretary Baker and is
understood to have reiterated his desire
to retire to private life.
Secretary Baker declined to discuss
that feature of the conference. He
probably will present tne general's
request to President Wilson within a
few days.
RAILROADS PR0P08E TO
COMPROMISE WITH MEN.
New York.?A compromise is the
railroads' view of the way the differences
between them and their 360,000
employes should be settled. This was
hinted at the session of the conference
and railroad and union representatives
in this city when on the
completion of the presentation of the
men's cases the railroads defined their
position. Chairman Lee said that between
the two levels the question is
bound to settle.
FUNSTON WARNED OF BAND
ON WAY FOR BORDER RAIDS.
San Antonio. Tex.?General Funston
announced that he had wwhat appeared
to be positive information that Luis
de La Rosa was marching from a
point south of Laredo toward the bor
der with the evident intention of raiding
the country somewhere west of
Rio Grande City. There are not now
in that district eunuch American
troops to prevent de La Rosa and his
men from crossing. The harder pat

TRU'JTPH OF KENT A SHOWS STAYI>'G
QUALITY OF TIKES.
"The expected happened at the Indianopolis
races," says a Goodrich official,
"Resta. the favorite, in a Peugeot.
equipped with Silvertown Tires
won the 300 mile Speedway Sweepstakes.
with plenty to spare.
Aside from Resta's wonderful driving
and the unusual mechanical perfection
of the Peugeot car, the feature
of the great race was the stamina and
staying qualities of Silvertown Tires.
Seventeen out of 22 entries were Silvertowns.
The first three cars at the
finish were Silvertown equipped, and
each car only made one stop in 300
miles. Resta aijd Mulford both said
that is was not necessary for them to
make the one tire change, but that,
having stopped for other reasons, they
took the time and precaution of changing
one tire.
Resta said after the 300 mile drive
that races used to be a battle* of UTee,
and the vdriver .who .
16"bo' rh'rotigh\tHh buwew
tire changes won the race. But now
with .the time tested Silvertowns, tire
troubles and blowouts have been practically
eliminated. The Goodrich Company
has made it possible for cars to
develop 100 miles or more per hour
j with safety.
D'Alene, who was second in his Duesenberg,
was enthusiastic over Silvertown
Tire service. 'You cannot make
my endorsement of Silvertowns for
road driving or racing too strong,' he
said. 'The race today shows there was
never a better tire made than Silvertowns."
Ralph Mult'ord, who was third
in iiis Peugeot, said. '1 have always
been a Silvertown booster. Last year
1 went through the Chicago 300 mile
race without a tire change. Recently,
1 broke the world's 24-liour record wit
but one tire change in 1300 miles,with
the Hudson Super-Six with Silvertown
all around. Silvertowns give your car
more speed with less motor- power,
save gasoline, and eliminate all' ordinary
tire trouble.'
Mrs. Dario itesta attended the
races in her Premier equipped with
i the classy Black Tread Silvertowns.
I Tiesides giving better service, \urs.
i Uestu said, 'Silvertowns give my car
a classy appearance and make it ride
easier.'
The drivers, before and after the
races, commented on the Sportsmanship
offer made by The if. F. Goodrich
Company, of $1O,u0U prizes to the
champion drivers of America. 'At
first we thought it. was necessary lor
j us to use Silvertowns in order to be
eligible for the prize, "said one of the
j drivers, "but we iiud that the Goodi
rich Co. will give the prize to the best
I driver, regardless of the tires used.'
From the comments made as a result
of the great showing made by Silvertowns
yesterday, the drivers think it
' will be many a day before a tire is
: made that will equal the Silvcrtown
for all around road and track effl'
ciency. Most of the drivers with
their cars left Tuesday night t<< tune
up their cars for the Chicago o<?J mile

Charleston Yard to be Improved.

the naval appropriation bill fsr
the present session South CaroliM
had fared well, both the navy yard at
Charleston and the old naval station
at Port Royal having received abund*
ant money to keep them going. The
best thing for Charleston Is the fact
that $175,000 Is voted for deepening
the Cooper river at the approach to
the navy yard. Earlier In the session %
a fight was made when efforts were
put forth to secure this money In the
river and harbor bill. It has been long
recognized that the navy yard wotfld
never attain its full capacity until the
Cooper river could be cleared of bare
at the approach to the yard. The action
by the house Is the biggest thing
that could possibly happen for Charleston
for many a year. It means that
the yard will be opened to receive the
largest of battleships and that when
the work of clearing the channel is
finished there need hereafter be no
need to fear that any ship, no matter
how large, would be endangered by
attempting to get In.
Tn addition to this, the $6,000,000
voted, which will under retain circumstances
permit the secretary of
the navy to build ships at the various
yards, will put Charleston In the run- n
ntng. The only thiug that has militated
against It has been its bad approach.
and now that this is to be removed,
everything looks bright la that
direction.
