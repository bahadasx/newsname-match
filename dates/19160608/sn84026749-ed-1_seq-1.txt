Says Differences Between Re

Decrease to Nothing.
OYSTER BAY. June 8. Colonel Roose
velt today replied as follows to William
P. Jackson, of Maryland, who invited
him to address the national convention:
"In answer to your telegram. I can
only say that the matter lies with the
Republican convention, and that if the
convention desires me to address it. I
shall bejglad to do so.
"I very earnestly hope that the Re
publicans and Progressives assembled
at Chicago will keep steadily In mind
the gravity of this crisis, not only for
America but for the world, and the need
that their action In dignity, foresight,
and patriotism shall rise level to tho
crisis.
"I hope that tho aim will be not
merely to nominate a man who can do
elected next November, but a man of
such power, character, steadfast con
viction, and provod ability that it
elected he will again place this nation
whoro it belongs by making it true to
Itself and, therefore, true to all man
kind. Attacks President.
"President Wilson, .however amiable
his Intentions, haa rendered to this peo
ple tho most evil service that can be
rendered to a great democracy by its
chosen leader.
"He has dulled the national con
science and relaxed tho spring of lofty
national motive by teaching our peo
ple to accept high-sounding words as
the oft set and atonement for shabby
deeds, and to use words which mean
nothing In order to draw all meaning
.ruin uiuBo wnicn nave a meaning. It '
will be no easy task to rouso the aus-'
i.-j icu-icaiKH wmen naa oeen luueu
to slumber by those means.
"To this task we should bend our
united energies In the spirit of Wash
ington and Lincoln, tho spirit of genuine
democratic leadership, tho spirit which
seta the standard to which the nation
ought to rise, and then with confident
nope i nppeul to the soul of the people
so that they may In fact support the
standard thus raised.
Belittles Differences.
"The differences that have divided,
not merely Republicans and Progres
sives, but good Americans of all shade
of political belief, from one another la
the past sink Into nothing when conv
pared with the Issues now demanding
decision for thce Issues are vital to
the national llf. They are tho Issues
of a unified Americanism and of na
tional preparedness.
"If we aro not all of us Americans
and nothing else, scorning to divide
along the lines of section, of creed, or
of national origin, then tho nation Itself
will crumble Into dust. If we ore not
thoroughly prepared. If we have not de
veloped a strength which respects the
rlghta of others, but which la also ready
to enforce from others respect for its
own rights, then sooner or later we shall
have to submit to tho will of an alien
conqueror.
Not Abstract Questions.
"These questions are not tn the
realm of abstract thought. They
must bo taken out of the world of
cloudy promise and vague phrasing
Into the world of performance and
of fact. They are today In concrete
form before you and your fellows
for your decision.
"For two years. In the face of the
awful world cataclysm, this nation
has stood suplna and holploss nnd has
not In tho smallest degree prepared
Itself to ward off the danger.
"No promise, no excuse now made by
those responslbU for this Inaction, Is
entitled to consideration. It is for you

that they have a worthy alternativo

German-Americans Target.
"The professional German-Americans

Radicals Sure of Nomination,
But Conservative Members
Are Not So Sure.
By H. L. RENNICK.
CHICAGO, June $. Progressive radi
cals believe Colonel Roosevelt will bo
nominated by tho Bull Monro inven
tion before midnight tonight. The con
servative don't bcllevo ho will.
It Is this difference or opinion among
tho Bull Mooscrs that Is back of a tight
being waged through committee ses
sions todnv. and to be continued when
the convention reconvened at 2 p. m
Former Secretary of Commerco nnd
Labor Oscar Straus declared tho Bull
Moose would nominate Roosevelt.
"Roosevelt will bo nominated," said
he. "The only thing that might holt
it would be for Hughes to como out In
a ntatement before the Progressive
party acts. Thnt would glvo use some
thing to work on. Otherwise. Roosevelt
will be nominated by tho Progressives."
Straus said tho Republicans should
name n formal conference committee.
and the Progressives should ilo like
wise. He pointed out the Republicans
were atrald or cringing up uie suoieci
In their convention lest It cause friction.
That in ltseit is a sign oi weaKncss,
ald Mr. Straus. "Just as In a labor
dispute, the side that refuses to arbi
trate is IooKoa on as naving me weu
case."
"I believe the Progressive convention
will nominate Roosevelt by midnight.
and that his nomination will be squarely
up to tho Republicans to tako or leave
as tney see lu, sain wiiuam wuen
Whlto, of Kansas.
Governor Johnson probably will be
the Vice Presidential nominee.
From tho other side, came only sage
shaking of heads and an expression of
confldenco that no precipitate action will
bo taken.
George W. Perkins, chief exponent of
a conference agreement with the Re
publicans, held a midnight conference
with Governor Johnson of California,
Strnus, and William H. Chllds. of New
York. Then T. R. was telephoned nt
Oyster Bay.
Tho commltteo on rules and perma
nent organization, after night sessions.

program, it Is reported that the con
servative clement among tho Bull
Mooscrs has succeeded In forcing an
agreement on waiter Brown, of Ohio,
as permanent chairman.

CHAIRMAN FOR
First Spontaneous Outbreak of
Convention Comes When
Harding Is Honored.
SESSION IS LATE STARTING
Weather Conditions the Same as
Yesterday, But Enthusiasm
Is Shown Everywhere.
By PERRY ARNOLD.
COLISEUM. CHICAGO. June K. The
first spontaneous outbreak of tho Re
publican convention came today when
Senator Warren G. Harding was made
permanent chairman by tho adoption
of the commltteo report making the
temporary organization permanent.
Starting first with scattered applause,
the demonstration gradually increased
In volume and In two or three minutes
tho entire convention was on its feet
cheering. Tflo demonstration lasted
five minutes.
The convention began Its second day's
session at U:S. twenty-two minutes
behind time. .
At'inough woaf.her conditions wena
tdentlcal with those of vesterdav. thero
was a noticeable warming up of en
thusiasm among the delegates who yes
terday couldn't seem to shake off the
dispiriting effect of a cold and wet
div.
Today the hall was more nearly Ailed
when Temporary Chairman Hordinga
gnvel fell, only a few seats being va
cant In the. topmott galleries.
Band Plays Lively Airs.
More women wore on hand and lent
more color to the cene. The band
played more lively airs, and there were
soveral outbursts Indicated more "pep"
everywhere.
The program today was largely rou
tine. But it was apparent most of the
delegates wanted to break forth whtn
something worth yelling about camo up.
Tho resolutions committee expected
tb make n report of its platform drati
this afternoon, furnishing the only spot
development expected.
Tho convention hadn't been In session
fifteen minutes, when the new "pep"
showed In n really spontaneous and
prolonged demonstration for Senator
O. Harding, when ho was chosen per
manent chun men.
Tho cheers and applause continued
live minutes, although Harding strovo
to stop It by frequent pounding of his
gavel.
The report of the credentials com
mittee passed willingly and tho session
then turned to tho work of permanent
organization.
William Hahn, of Mansfield. Ohio,
reported the organization committee
recommendation to make the temporary
line-up permanent nnd this was adopted.
Then came the cheering. After
Jockeying for position, the crowd
worked up to tho point of arising
In spots ana cheered enthusiastically
If sporadically.
Harding stood modestly smiling',
banging his gavel on the two-Inch
oak plank and striving to head off
his friends.
"It's a very great honor." he said
In accepting his new Job. "I'm a be
liever in the keeping of compacts and
It was Insisted if I were made per
manent chairman that I wouldn't
make a speech and I'm going to keep
that compact.

The nomination waj atnt to the

CHICAGO, June . Finishing touches

grcsslve platforms today.
Doth declare strongly for true pre
paredness for the nation, both military
and Industrial. "Americanism" nlso
features both declarations, and the O.
O. P. and Bull seem to bo united In a
demand for a tariff of "reasonable"
protectlvencss.
The Progressives want a standing
army of at least 210,000 men. while the
O. O. P. would have It strong enough
to form tho nucleus of an effective
mobile force In caso of war.
As to the navy, the Republicans stand
for one largo enough to defend the na
tion "wherover necessary," and the Pro
gressUcs would make it second in the
world.
A new proposal Is made by the Q. O,
P. for the Federal Government to take
over complete regulation of transpor

missions In their control over railroads

News That Colonel Would Refuse to Run on
Progressive Ticket a Shock to Irrecon
cilable Element of the Party.
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 8. Repub
lican leaden intimate the convention work will
be speeded up and the nominations made tonight.
Rumors of this created a big sensation. It indi
cates Hughes backers feel certain they will win.
By JUDSON C. WEI.L1VER.
CHICAGO, June 8. Jus tat the hour when the Re
pul lican delegates were gathering at the Colieum for the
opening of the second day's sessio nof their convention,
Walter Brown, of Toledo, Ohio, member of the Progressive
national committee an done of the closest associates of Geo.
W. Perkins in representing Colonel Roosevelt, told some of
the Progressive party leaders that it was all over.
Roosevelt, he said, had determined to support Hughes
and to refuse to run on the Progressive ticket
The announcement had a stunning effect on the irrec
oncilable Bull Moosers. It hadn't become public property
at the time when the Republican convention assembled.
Among the Moose leaders who were taken in on the
secret, there was general admission that, being true, it ended
everything; that Hughes would be .nominated "by the Re
publicans, and that there would be a sharp fight in the Pro
gressive convention over the question of whether to make
an independent nomination, say of Hiram Johnson or Gif
ford Pinchot, or to accept the inevitable and acquiesce in the
Hughes candidacy.
BULL MOOSE NOT CHEERFUL.
A conference of Chairmen Raymond Robins, William
Allen White, Gifford Pinchot, Harold Ickis, of Illinois;
Henry Allen, of Kansas, and other important Progressives
was hurriedly held in the corridor of the Blackstone Hotel,
immediately outside the headquarters rooms of George W.
Perkins. The news of the Oyster Bay decision was dis
cussed in fervid terms.
There has been a feeling for several days among these
irreconcilables that matters were tending toward a deter
mination such as that just announced, and they haven't been
cheerful about the prospect.
"You're talking to a man that's mad all through," de
clared Mr. Pinchot, and everybody else in the group echoed
that sentiment.
What were they to do? Should they plunge ahead,
nominate Roosevelt in the Progressive convention instanter
an1 let him take the responsibility of withdrawing entirely
on himself? Or should they wait and talk with Roosevelt
over the telephone, learn in detail his viewpoint and wishes,
and then take counsel ?
It was finally agreed that this group should meet again
between noon and 1 o'clock and get Colonel Roosevelt on
the long distance wir6 and talk it over with him.
WANTS SOME TALKING DONE
"But," protested one in the group of agitated men,
'Biown and Perkins have been talking right along with the
Colonel over their wire here, they know all about what he
wants."
"I know," retorted another, "but I want some talking
done for just us." So it was agreed that they should get
together in an hour or two for a pow-wow with Oyster Bay
in their own behalf, and the temper of the gathering sug
gested that some sizzling observations would likely be trans
mitted over the copper circuit.
Simultaneously with this report that Roosevelt had
determined to yield, came from Republican leadership quar
ters the rumor that the Republican convention is to be speed
ed up and a nomination made today. To help assure this,
Harding has been selected for permanent chairman, thus
doing away with the need to wait through the speech' of a
permanent chairman. . .
