Rational Convention Will

Plenty of Applause But on

By Harding Long
Coliseum, Chicago, June 7.—The
republican national convention^ af
ter two and a half hour meeting
today, adjourned until 11 o'clock
tomorrow morning after hearing
the keynote speech by Senator
Harding ,of Ohio and doing the
usual preliminary organization
work.
The talk of harmony with the
progressives, who assembled In

was. lost for the time being In the
work of organizing the republican

the surface meanwhile and there
were renewed indications that the
republican leaders were consider

progressives in the hope of finding
a compromise ground.

publican national convention began
its first day's business shortly before
noon today by hearing the keynote
speech by Senator Harding of Ohio,
temporary chairman, and then going

A roar of applause swept over the
hall at that and at his reference to
the need of preparedness for national
defense.
Senator Harding's speech was long
—about 15,000 words—but the conven
tion was orderly and on the whole
quiet during its delivery.
Clear Out Aisles.
The order was given to fclear the
aisles at 10:59 and the police began
moving out all who were not delegates
and forcing the delegates "to their sec
tions.
There was a noticeable lack of dem
onstration for prominent men. Sena
tor Lodge came quietly in and took his
seat unnoticed, as did Senator Murphy,
Gov. Whitman and other well known
men.
Chauncey Depew was one of the
well known men to be recognised as
he made his way to the first row
seats. Around of handclapping greet
ed him.
The band played the Star Spangled
banner at 11:25. Everybody rose.
When the house quieted down Sep
geant-at-arms Stone ordered the dele
gates seated.
At 11:28. Chairman Hilles brought
down the gavel. This brought ap
plause. The hall grew still as Chair
man Hilles said a quorum was present
and the convention would be in order.
A male quartet led In singing. The
voices of the delegates swelled
through the big hall,

tion.
There were applause, enthusiasm
and cheers but a noticeable absence
of the almost riotous demonstrations
which have marked previous conven
tions.
Senator Harding was greeted by the
first loud demonstration as he took
his placp and began delivering the
prepared speech in which he empha
sised the need for party harmony for
victory at the polls.
"This is not the time for recrimina
tion," he said, "it is a day of reconse
cration."

In a mighty
choruB, almost drowning the band.
There was a moment of confusion
and the delegates took their seats
and then the Rev. John Timothy Stone
of Chlcagfc, offered prayer.
There was deep silence all over the
big hall. At his request the conven
tion remained seated.
The call for the convention was
read by Secretary Reynolds and Chair
man Hilles then presented Senator
Harding, temporary chairman,- to
make the keynote speech.
The loud cheers and applause of the
throng greeted him.
Senator Crane of Massachusetts,
benator Borah of Idaho and William
Mcltinley of Illinois, were selected to
escort Senator Harding to the plat
form. Applause greeted the mention
of all the names as Chairman Hilles
announced them.

GL O. P. COUNCILS.
[BY R. D. MACMANUS.]
Chicago, June 6.—Of the great fight
being waged for the republican 'nom
ination of president, there is little ap
parent on the surface as the crowds of
delegates, alternates and visitors surge
through the lobbies and halls of the
Congress hotel and the other hostelries
which are being used as headquarters
by the various delegations and can
didates.
Therd are many rumors and tales
of conferences between leaders and
"fixers" and there is more or less
enthusiasm evident at the various
headquarters but as far as any bitter
ness is concerned—it is conspicuous
by its absence. The one thing that is
liiost evident, is the desire to prevent
a disastrous party altercation or an
out and out split.
The particular friends of Senate* A.
B, Cummins' candidacy express consid
erable satisfaction with the present
outlook. They have reason to believe,
they state, that the Roosevelt forces
can be swung for Cummins in the
event it is found that the colonel can
not win the nomination. The Iowa
headquarters are always well filled
with delegates and visitors and there
is considerable enthusiasm. Cummins
badges were given out today to all
Iowans and friends of the candidate
who appeared at headquarters. Many
of them are being worn.
Missourians Convene.'
The Missouri delegation had its first
caucus at its quarters in the Morrison
hotel this morning and plans were
laid for meetings to be held every
evening during the convention. The
best line that can be obtained on the
delegation splits the strength among
Weeks, Hughes and Fairbanks,. The
delegates are under no instructions
and have decided against any unit rule
in voting.

FUSES TO BE A PARTY TO

Auditorium, Chicago, June 7.—
The demonstration for Roosevelt
continued one hour and thirty
three minutes.
Temporary Chairman Robins
resumed his speech at 2:37 p. m.
He waved the big stlek and the
crowd caught the point.
Auditorium convention hall, June 7.
-^Delegates and guests of {he progres
sive convention arrived slowly for the
opening of the convention at 12 o'clock.
Reports that there might be an in
sistent demand for Immediate Tiomlna
tlon of Col. Roosevelt were discourag
ed in a statement by George W. Per
kins, ohlef spokesman for the party,
who declared the progressives were
meeting in a conciliatory spirit and
would not act precipitately while the
possibility of agreement with the re
publicans remained.
Mr. Perkins was asked if Col. Roose
velt would be nominated today.
"There is not a chance," he replied.
"We arfe not going to take any snap
Judgment"
Mr. Perkins said a telephone con
versation he had with Col. Roosevelt
this morning was devoted almost en
tirely to the bad weather here and at
Oyster bay. Neither of them, said Mr.
Perkins, regarded the weather as an
ill omen.
Mr.' Roosevelt will be kept in close
touch with development in the progres
sive convention by long distance tele
phone but the Oyster bay wire will not
be strung directly to the convention.
The convention was called to order
by Victor Murdock, chairman of the
progressive national committee at
12:27 p. m. The demonstration was
tremendous.
An insurgent movement against the
selection of Walter Brown of Ohio for
permanent chairman was stalled quiet
ly on the convention floor. It was
planned by radical delegates to present
Gov. Johnson of ^California.
Gov. Johnson heard of the movement
by insurgents to name him for per
manent chairman, and sent word he
would not be a party to discord.
Johnson Enters Quietly.
Gov. Johnson of California, pro
gressive candidate for vice president
in 1912, stepped quietly into a seat in
the California delegation shortly be
fore the convention convened. Mrs.
Johnson and a party of friends occu
pied a box above the California group.
Among progressive notables on the
stage were James R. Garfield, Wil
liam Flinn and Oscar Straus. The lat
ter was cheered when recognized.
George W. PerkinB was given an
ovation when he came upon the stage.

MEN OF A BOLT
Leader of Justice's Crowd
Does Not Consider
It as Bad News
"V,
ROOSEVELT IS HOME
AND KEEPS SILENT
While "Refraining From Any
Remarks His Attitude
Is Well Known
Chicago, June 7.—New York repub
licans supporting Justice Hughes said
today that they were informed from
reliable sources that under no cir
cumstances would Col. Roosevelt sup
port Justice Hughes if he were nom
inated by the republican convention.
A report that Col. Roosevelt had said
in Oyster Bay that he/would favor a
third party ticket if Hughes were the
republican nominee brought forth the
statement from the Hughes men.
Gov. Whitman, leader of the Hughes
faction of the New York delegates,
smiled when he was told of the re
ported statement.
"I don't consider that bad news, do
you?" he said "I have thought all
along that Justice Hughes would be
nominated and elected, and I still
think so. We have, I lenderstand,
within fifty-eight votes of a majority
guaranteed on the second ballot."
The governor said he knew nothing
of reports that the justice would de
cline to run if a third ticket was put
Into the field.
ROOSEVELT REFRAINS.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 7.—While
Col. Roosevelt refrains from making
any statement disclosing his real atti
tude toward'the political situation In
Chicago, it is well known to his in
timates here that he is opposed to
the nomination of Justice Hughes and
it Is their confident belief that if the
Justice is nominated the colonel *tfll

^'^^fhotifeh Coi. Roosevelt and a sec
retary, Walter Hayes, remained a good
part of last night at the private tele
phone wire between Sagamore Hill
and the progressive party headquar
ters in Chicago, the colonel said this
morning there was no statement he
cared to make, except to repeat that
he was neither for nor against any
candidate.
While the nature of the telephone
conversations is not allowed to trans
pire, Col. Roosevelt's followers here
assert that reports from his lieuten
ants in Chicago are favorable to the
colonel's ^candidacy. Only the most
trusted of the colonel's counsellors
ar4 permitted to talk over the wire,
which is guarded by employes of the
telephone company all along the line
to prevent any possibility of a leak.
Teddy Dissatisfied.
Col. Roosevelt, it is well understood,
Is not at all satisfied with Justice
Hughes' so-called "flag speech," which
he is said to regard as merely a
"Fourth of July" address having no
value as disclosing the justice's atti
tude toward the real issues of the day.
In words of his followers here, the col
onel regards the speech as further
"evidence of pussyfooting," to which
attitude he is opposed in the present
crisis in the country's affairs. His fol
lowers look for a broadside from him
within a day 6r two which they say
will be calculated to eliminate Justice
Hughes and any other candidate ifeom
the colonel regards as representing the
pussyfoot idea."
"The colonel feels," they say, "that
if the republicans have made up their
minds to nominate a man representing
this idea, the one thing left for him to
do is to run himself in order to bring
before the people the issue of straight
forward Americanism."

Berlin, June 7.—In the account of
the emperor's speech to the sailors of
the fleet at, Wilhelmshaven yesterday,
which was published here today, the
emperor is quoted a\ saying that the
great naval battle off Jutland has de
stroyed Great Britain's supremacy on
the sea.
In praising the sailors the emperor
said:
"I, standing here today as your su
preme war lord, thank you from the
bottom of my heart. As the represen
tative of the fatherland I thank you
and in the name of my army I bring
yon its greetings because you have
done your duty unselfishly and only
with the one thought that the enemy
must be beaten.
"At a time when the enemy is slow
ly being crushed before Verdun and
when our allies have driven the Ital
ians from mountain to mountain you
add new glories to our cause. The
"World was prepared for everything but
not for the victory of the German fleet
over the English. The start which
you have made will cause fear to creep
into the bones of the enemy. What
you h^ve done you did for the father
land, that in the future it may have
freedom of the seas for Its commerce.
Therefore, I ask you to Join me in
three cheers for our dearly beloved
fatherland."

The fact that the crops are ready for

DISLIKES COLLEGE
AS TRAINING PLACE
New York, June 7.—The college is
not intended as a place to teach mili
tary training and the modern curricu
lum does not provide room enough for
suoh instruction in a way which would
count in a crisis, Henry S. Pritchett,
president of the Carnegie foundation
for the advancement of teaching, de
clared today at the New York univer
sity commencement exercises.
Mr. Pritchett said further that the
"contribution of the land grant col
leges-to^the .preparations of a reserve
of cltisen soldiery was practically neg
ligible." He ridiculed "the assump
tion of our legislators that military
training could be made a byproduct
of a college course" and declared that
many of the land grant colleges, made*
possible by the Morrill act of 1862,
continue the required military train
ing only "to obtain the constitutional
grant."
He said others give "only the mini
mum drill" and that "the individual'
student In many cases seeks to escape
his military duties with as scant a per
formance as possible." Under this
act he said, 20,086 students received
training last year, making a total to
day of more than 200,000 men between
the ages of 19 and 30 years trained in
this manner.

EVERY 80LDIER WEARS A BAND
OF CREPE AND WHOLE
OOUNTRY 18 GRIEVED.
London, June 7.—The British army
went into mourning today for its late
chief. Every officer wore a band of
crepe on his left arm. Throughout
the country, flagB were at half mast.
There was of course no suspension
of activities having to do with the
prosecution of the vfar and at the war
office and other governmental depart
ments officials continued to work out
details of the scheme which Earl
Kitchener formulated.
From allied and neutral countries,
the dominions, colonies and depend
encies came a flood of telegrams ex
pressing sympathy. In the dominions,
including South Africa, legislatures ad
journed as a mark of respeot for the'
dead leader. The news was received
in the South African assembly during
discussion of estffri&tes. Premier
Botha, who was deeply affected, made
an immediate announcement and mov
ed adjournment while the members,
Dutch and British, remained standing
as a tribute to the man who won the
dominion for Great Britain against the
forces in which many of the legislators
fought.
Newspapels and many commercial
organisations have taken up the de
mand for immediate internment of all
foreigners of belligerent nationalities
on the ground that they may have in
formed the enemy of the departure of
Kitchener and his staff and thus be
responsible for the destruction of the
Hampshire.
Premier Asquith temporarily has
taken personal charge of the war of
flee.
At the suggestion of the Jockey
club, the Windsor race meeting, which
was to have been held this week, has
been cancelled on account of Hfcrl

PLAN OFFENSIVE
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
SAYS THEY DO NOT
ARMY
INTEND TO ACT NOW.
General Headquarters of thf Bul
garian Army at Kuestendit, May 25.—
(Correspondence of The Associated
Press)—Gen. Nichoalal Jekoff, com
mander in chief of the Bulgarian
army, Intimated today to a cor
respondent of The Associated Press
that he had no present intention of
engaging in an offensive campaign
against the allleB in Greece.
"If the Greek government,'^ he said,
"can stand the Anglo-French forces on
its territory, I am sure we can."
The correspondent, who was per
mitted by Gen. J'ekoff to. make a tour
of the Bulgat-German front, found the
Bulgarian troops well equipped and in
fine physical condition. Attached to
the various divisional staffs were Ger
man officers. Maj. Gen. Todoroff, com
mander of tlje second Bulgarian army,
has six German officers in his service
Gen. Zlatareff, second division, has
three, and Gen. Guechoff, eleventh
division, has two.
These officers have no voice in
tactical or administrative matters.
Their duties are entirely confined to
instructing the Bulgarians in trench
building and other technical details
of modern warfare. As far as the
observation of the correspondent went,
the relation between the German and
Bulgarian officers seemed to be
cordial.
