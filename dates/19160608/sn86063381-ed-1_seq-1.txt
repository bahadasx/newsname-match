Hibbing, Minn June 8.Hun-
dreds of delegates, farmers, business
men and professional men, from all
sections of Northern Minnesota are
here today to attend the summer ses

velopment association.

today extended a glad hand of wel
come to the delegates through its
mayor, Victor L. Power.
This morning the delegates wore
registered and were given badges
Committees escorted the visitors to
the convention hall in automobiles.
Middleton Presides.
It was shortly before eleven o'clock
when President C. R. Middleton of
Baudette called the meeting to order
Rev B. A Idstrom of Hibbing de
livered the invocation. Mayor Vic

welcome and President Middleton re
sponded to it fittingly
L. A. Rossman, associate publisher

plied to Northern Minnesota.

that exists in Northern Minnesota
Would Develop State.
Attorney E E. McDonald of Be
mulji in an able address this after
noon told of the "Automobile High
ways in the State He told of the
Jefferson Highway project and ex
plained why the route through Be
midji would do more for the develop
ment of Northern Minnesota than
other routes. His address was as
iollows:
The subject of my address might
suggest that there were highways in
this state distinctively for automobile
use, and I feel that the good commit
tee that selected this subject for me
to speak upon desire that I should
devote most of my time to those roads
which are distinctively automobile
highways But I cannot let*this op
portunity to refer to the general use
of all highways by automobiles pass
without calling your attention to the
fact that the citizens of Minnesota
today are demanding that all high
ways shall, with the greatest possible
haste, become automobile highways.
There was a time when those resid
ing along and using common high
ways regretted the appearance of the
automobile thereon.
Times Have Changed.
But that condition has changed
and we have reached a point where
not only is the automobile welcomed
upon all highways but it is now in
demand, universally, that all high
ways shall be put in automobile con
dition So that it would be proper
for me now to speak of all highways
in this state, because the highway is
indeed poor, obscure and in a de
serted place that does not bear up
on its surface each several automo
biles.
Returing to what I might well des
ignate as distinctive automobile high
ways, I will ask your pardon for re
ferring briefly to the history of
highways in this country.
Territorial Roads.
As I enter upon this matter, the
minds of many of you go back to
the territorial roads, the trails, the
state roads, the government roads,
in this state. Then as the territory
became settled, there was added what
is known as the system of town
roads. There was adopted the plan
of state aid to public highways. The
town system has its many good feat
ures. It was in many instances
abused. The county system has its
many good features and in time and
instances that system became abused.
It seemed to be necessary that the
state should, by its financial assist
ance a well as general supervision,
come to the rescue of the matter of
constructing and maintaining high
ways in this state.
You are all aware of the fact that

Out Break at G. 0. P. Convention Still Raining in Chicago
Bookmakers Continue to Bet Even on Teddy.
BOOM IS STARTED FOR FAIRBANKS
TO BE NAMED AS A COMPROMISE
(By United Press)
Chicago, 111., June 8.The rain continued today. There is no sun
in the heavens and no sun of political ascendancy for the Republicans.
There is still doubt and apprehension and leaders are alive to the neces-
sity of lining things up.
The liveliest spot in Chicago is among the favorite sons' row where
there is a firm belief that a compromise candidate must be chosen. Fair-
banks' managers are making a strong drive.
Betting Teddy.
Bookmakers are still betting ev en money for Roosevelt as the Repub-
lican candidate.
Progressive radicals think that Roosevelt will be nominated on the
Progressive ticket before midnight. The conservatives are opposing this
and this was the situation preceding the opening of the Progressive con-
vention at two o'clock this afternoo n.
The first Republican spontaneous outburst came today when Sena-
tor Harding was made permanent hairman. Committee reports were
adopted and the temporary organiza tion was made permanent. The dem-
onstration lasted for five minutes. The Republican convention opened at
11:22 this morning.
Suffrage is Decided.
The Republican platform to be a dopted today takes a strong stand
Tor out and out Americanism, de Clares for a navy that fears no power
in the world and a standing army of sufficient size from an effective mo-
bilized foe in case of war.
Woman's suffrage was decided by the entire committee by a vote
of 26 to 21.
The prohibition plank was not included.
The proposal that the Federal gov-*
ernment take over the complete regu
lation of transportation, supplanting
the state railway and service com
mission has been recommended and
may pass.
T. R. Not Coming.
A dispatch from Oyster Bay says
that Roosevelt today stated "I have
no intention of going to Chicago." La
Salle hotel managers claim that he
has not reserved rooms, but that the
Moosers reserved an entire floor and
may hold some for Teddy.
In Washington today, Representa
tive Alfalfa Bill Murray, Democrat
from Oklahoma in the house, attack
ed the Hughes presidential boom as
violating an American rule that the
courts be kept free from politics.
The Republicans adjourned at noon
to four o'clock this afternoon.
Representative McKinley of Illi
nois admitted this afternoon that the
Republicans planned to start on the
nomination immediately after dispos
ing of the platform, possibly at four
o'clock this afternoon.
Approves Apportionment.
By a vote of 28 to 6, the Republi
can convention committee on rules
and order of business yesterday ap
proved the present basis of apportion
ment of delegates to the national
convention, made by the national
committee in December, 1913, and la
ter endorsed by every state conven
tion, which reduced the representa
tion of southern states 89 delegates.
Under this rule each state is given
more delegates at large, and one
delegate for each congressional dis
trict, with an additional delegate in
each district passing more than 7,
each distrist passing 7,500 or more
votes.

Tarns Bixby, who used to direct the
political destinies of Minnesota as

cronies.
Tarns is now beardless and his hair
and mustache, black when he was in
the governor's office, are now snow
white. When he registered at Min
nesota headquarters the signature no
one ever could read except Tarns'
bankers. Bixby wrote after it "Be-
midji, Minnesota."
