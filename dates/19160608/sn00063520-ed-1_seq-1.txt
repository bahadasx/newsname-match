THE RAILROAD WORKS
The railroad graders are hero and
working on the Improvements plan
ned for the local yards.
The plana seem to be aubject to
changes, but from hat we van learn
the paaalng track I to be extended
south 2,000 feet. Thla will require
quite a fill aud the teams are now
busy with this work.
The centre of the yards south of
the depot are to he graded up level
and new tracka laid the full length
The ditch through the yards la being
covered and the grading will be start
ed In a few days.
There are other tracks to be plac
ed, for the better bundling of the
business here. A public loading
track and a storage track for the ex
tra equipment are planned
There la to be a large water tank
placed near the stock yards and the
water piped to the depot grounds
and buildings.
It ill he noted that all the Im
provements are being made In the
south end of the yards, although
they could be made In the northern
1 ml at much less expense.
No announcement haa been made
regarding the round houses and ma
chine shops and probably will not
be until the Oregon & Eastern la
completed to Bendier aud a new train
schedule inaugurated.
The run to Bendier will be ao long
that it w.ll hardly be possible for
one of the crews to do the Ilomcdalc
buslneaa, ao that some change will
be neoeaaary there and it may be
possible that the Vale train will
make the run to Emmett and also
look after the run to Uoinedale.
Some of the heavy aleel has ar
rived for the line from here to Vale
and thla work will be started In a
few days.
With theae aeveral crews busy,
hen- for .--.-veral week there will !
quite a payroll.

HELP EARNERS
Urged Change in Constitu
tion to Borrow Money
on School Fund
Salem, Ore., Juno 2. Governor
Withyronihe ald beforo the itato
convention of farmera' union at
Friend, Ore., he would urge Its mi'in
hers to drnft and Initiate a constitu
llonal nnirndment that will permit
the stnte land hoard to borrow mon
ey on the school securities and loan
It to farmera at five per cent Inter
est. Such a plan la feasible, and would
in hi.- cheap money to the farmers
sooner Hum any other, he explained.
The school fund Is now loaned on
farm property at 6 per cent, and no ,
loan I made In exceaa of one-third I
the value of the property, he aald.
The loan total approximately 16,-;
000,000; the state la the holder of 1
securities of this value, and ho de
clares that he I strongly In favor,
of a constitutional amendment that
will permit the atate to borrow
money on them, and loan It to the
farmera. While the plan would
necessitate a reduction of the In
terest rate on the school fund to R
per cent, provision could be made
for Ita compensation from the In
terest obtained from loam made
with funds derived by hypothecating
the school fund securities, he aald.

BANK DEPOSITS ARE
Within the year ending May 1 the
deposits in all the banks in Oregon
increased 112,698,000, a gain of
more than 10 par cent. While this
ih.reaee is very gratifying there is
one feature of It that merits partic
ular attention, namely, the very
large gain since early spring.
I According to the report of the su
perintendent of hanks, made public
last week, the increase from March
7 to May 1 (statements were called
toi on these dates) waa $8 Ha, 000 ,
lain in these two mouths was nearly
o.ju.il to the gain of the previous;
ten mouths. A large part of It is
credited to lint revival of the lumber
industry, still it must be clear to the.
intelligent observer that the increas
ed deposits reflect g marked improve
