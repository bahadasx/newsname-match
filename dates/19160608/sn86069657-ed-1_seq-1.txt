fe2,e6s;o. over tho figarea certified to
the Auditor. The assessment of 90
counties was accepted without change,
aad in &i counties raises were made
ranging from two per cent to thirty
five per cent. Nineteen counties ac
cepted! the change without protest and,
sixty-five counties had witnesses to
appear-before the Board.
The road tax amounts to $1,488,310.96
which is ten per cent- of the amount of
State tax..
In this report the members of tha
Board enclose a circular.letter whlel)
they hare taken the liberty, to send to
the assessors of tho various counties,
iastruetiag them to make tho 1918
asaeMnicBt in compliance with the law.
The report says that before, an assessor,
can receive his pay he must appear be-fere-
the County Judge and take an
oath provided in flection 4071 of. the"
KyvStatutea. that all of tho property
la the county has been assessed at Its
fair cash value.
- "The tax laws are sufficient' says
the report, "if enforced uniformly
throuKhout the State to produce "all
the revenues to support tlie cityrcolin-,

The good roads engineers are
here and surveying out tho routes
for the new roads that are to be
built. It seems that the route
that is being selected is not going
to please some of us, but we will
haver to remember that every
body in Powell cannot be pleas
ed. It would be a crooked road,
indeed, if it went where all tho
people along the route wanted
it. But they aro surveying the
route so a to get the best grade
and be out of water tide mark
as much as possible. Lot every
body get behind and boost and
don't be a knocker. Lord knows
that we need the roads bad
enough without anyone making
trouble. This is the time to
show your patriotism and stand
by these men who are selecting
the best route.
The Thirteenth District Sunday
School Convention, just held at
Jackson, was tne best ever held

there were fine-crowds, this be
ing especially true on Saturday

ty sent the most delegates, those
who went being Rev. Cleo Pur-vis-and
wife, Qlay City ; Buford
BVjiaghM Mill; MiBses4An-
Hattie Hardwlck, Walter f hack
er, and the writer. After hold
ing the office of President for five
years, the writer asked to be re
leased, and Rev. W. S. Itvin of
Jackson was elected; aud Mrs.
Robt. Conlee, who has been Sec
retary same length of fime, was
released at her request and.Miss
Nancy Maple, of Hazel Green,
elected in her place.
Freight Wreck.
The local freight running east

only slightly injured, although it
required over an hour's work to
release him. The train was in

Work Commences
on County Pikes.
The long awaited pikes are getting
nearer to a reality each day. At a
meeting of tho Commissioners a fen
days ago they selected Mr. Walter E.
Howe, Dean of the Engineering Dept.
of State University, Lexington, as the
County Engineer and he commenced
work this week, a road being located
from Stanton to Bowen. It is under
stood that this road will be built on the
opposite side of tho railroad from where
it is at present, owing to the fact that
some of the landowners along the line
of the old rdad want damages for any
land taken to straighten tho road.
On the newly selected route tho owners
of property have expressed their
wlfflngness to give any land necessary
to make a straight rood and this route
will also eliminate the dangerous Welch
crossing.
The engineer is to receive thirty
dollars a milo for surveying the route
where it follows the old roada and
thirty-fivo dollars a mile where it
follows, a new route, and will furnish
all his own help.
Another Good Well
Brought In
A fifty-barrel oil well was
brought in a few days ago on the
Steve Chaney farm on the head
waters of Hardwicks Creek, eight
miles east of here. This farm is
partly in Estill and partly in
Powell couaty, .aad,,6a?,wMl 4'
tonlya'fowjfeot over the line, on.
the Powell side. The Ohaney
place is part of a tract bought
fourteen years ago by Frank B.
Russell at forty cents an acre
and later sold by him to the
present owners at $2.50 an acre.
To show the increase in value,
Mr. Uhaney was offered $6,000
for the quarter acre containing
the well, but refused it. Mr.
Russell was present at tho bring
ing in of the well.
B. A. Bonniville is sinking u
well on the S. G. Baker farm and
is making good progress, while
the machine of Heien & Sher
man is due to strike the Band in
a day or so on the Clark: farm.
We hope to have good reports
from both theBO wolls for next
week.
"Stringbeans", the colored
slaok wire artist with the Carnival
Company, draws a good crowd to
