This was announced today in a reply
riade to an invitation he received
Wednesday night from senator Wm.

The colonel declared, in his answer,
that he hoped both the Republicans
and Progressives would nominate a
man who. if elected, would " place this
nation v. here it belongs by making it
true to itself and therefore true to
all mankind."
President Wilson he said, had ren- i

"Presidential row" in the Congress

new statements don't emanate.
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Mas

Three hundred votes for Hughes
on the first ballot and enough
more on the second to start a sweep of

Repnbliean leaders today. They assert
many "favorite son" delegates, after
delivering the complimentary votes for
which they are pledged, will immedl
ateiy turn to Hughes. This was the
situation when chairman Harding
broucht down the gavel in the Repub
lican convention at 11:3 J oclock for the
second days session.
On the Progressive side, it appeared
almost certain that CoL Roosevelt
wonld be nominated unless a compro
