Forethought.
People are learning that a little
forethought often saves them a
big expense. Here is an instance:
E. W. Archer, Caldwell, Ohio,
writes: "I do not believe that our
family has been without Cham
berlain's Colic, Cholera and
JJiarrhoea Remedy since'we com
menced keeping house years ago.
When we go on an extended
visit we take it with us. " Obtain

Will Not Race the 24th.
From a reliable source we learn
that there will be no Allie Mineer-
Jesse Pearce-Harry Randall foot
races at St. Johns on June 24th.
Randall for sum unknown cause,
did not '"come through," and
Pearce, owing to this being his
busiest time with his cattle outfit,
did not feel that the $250 put up
by Mineer for the 2:20 sprint was
inducement enough for him to
hire someone to look after his bns-
iness interests and go into train
ing. We understand if Mineer
will put up $500 or more for a
race Pearce will entertain such a
proposition. Snowflake Herald.

Holbrook Wins Again.
Last Sunday on the St. Johns
base ball grounds the Holbrook
team defeated the home '"team by
a score of 17 to 553. This is the
second time within f month that
the Holbrook club has defeated
the St Johns club. The result of
the two games gpes to show very
plainly that the St. Johns club
does not do any practicing for
with any practice at all they
should, have won the last game.
The Holbrook club does not show
that they have done very much
practicing, but apparently they
have done a great deal more than
the St. Johns boys have.
It is now up to the St. Johns
club to get in and do some prac
ticing and get in shape so that
when they do meet Holbrook
again they can at least make it
interesting for them.
Winslow is going to try and
have a base ball tournament there
next August and they are offering
a $200.00 prize for the first prize
and not less than $100.00 for the
second. It seems to us that is
worth trying for, why not put in
some good time practicing be
tween now and then. There is
plenty of good timber here for
two good teams and there is no
rpason whv we can not have as
c-ood a team as ahv town and in
our opinion, just.a little oetter.
Gome lets wake Up and do some
thing worth while.
Col. A. F. Banta Starts on
Prospecting' Trip.
