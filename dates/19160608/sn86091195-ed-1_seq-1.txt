GLADYS MITCHELL'S DEATH
SLIGHTLY AVENGED
Jesse Ceses of..Balt Lake City, the
young man whose reckless auto driving
caused the death of Miss Gladys Mit
chell and her affianced, of Riverside,
Idaho, has been found guilty of man
slaughter, the penalty for which is not
more. than a year in the county jail.
Commenting on the conviction the Po
catello Tribune says: 1 !
Geses, the Salt Lake individual who
ran down a couple of I dahpvpçoplc not
long ago, was'convicted of mauslaugh
ter, though thq penalty? -under the pe
uilinr form of conviction, is not in ex
cess of one : yaar •in. 'tKe county jeil.
Gesa» was a speed bug, and didn't stop
when lie ran over and killed two people.
He is one of the type that has little
regard for rules, regulations or road
law, and the only deplorable thing
about liis act or bis trial is that the
sentence is hardly adequate to answer
the purpose of supplying an example
The tragedy which resulted in the
conviction of Geses occurred at the in
tersection of Fifth East, and Seventh
Street South, shortly before midnight,
on November 13, 1915. The victims
had. alighted from a street car but an
instant before they were struck by the
automobile driven by Geses. They were
to have
been married the next day.
.... L..j nn tio i»:n.,.i
Davies was instantly killed. The se
verc mutilations of iiis body from the
impact of the automobile was men
•Honed by the trial judge drs conclusive I
evidence that the car operated by |
Gesas was driven at a reckless rate I
of speed. The young woman was fatal- j
ly injured, dying without, regaining '
consciousness.
ANOTHER AUTO COLLISION.
Yesterday evening Dr. Hoover and
David Brorkie, of Arco, had an auto col
lision on the corner of Main and Pacific,
in which no one. was hurt, but both cars
were considerably damaged'. Spectators
to the accident sav both drivers were to
blame, but Mr. Broekie who was on tho
wrong side of the street, was arrested
by Marshall Drew for a violation of
the auto ordinance. Upon the refusal
of Dr. Hoover to make a complaint
against him tlie charge was withdrawn,
and he gave his check for $50 to have
the Doctor's car repaired.

GREATLY BELOVED
LADY LAID TO REST
The funeral of Mrs. A. H. Stephens
took place at 2 o'clock last Friday aft
ernoon from her late home on North
Shilling avenue, where an immense con
course of friends and neighbors assem
bled to pay their last tribute of respect
and friendship to the deceased and her
broken-hearted and bereaved, husband
and three minor sons, whose great
lbss would be recovered if it were
possible for the unanimous and
sincere sympathy of a community to do
so. The Royal Neighbors, and the
Maccabees in white, attended the finie-
nil in bodies, as the deceased «'as one
of their most active members. The
floral offerings were most generous ami
very beautiful, the casket and once
happy home being almost bidden with
mounds of fresh roses, carnations and
lilacs. The services at the home were
conducted by the Rev. Jolfii Austin,
who dwelt impressively on the charit
able Christian life of the dead. As a
mark of respect for the dead, and an ev
idence of condolence for the living, the
merchants suspended business during
the funeral hour, amt the procession,
which consisted of fifty autos ami other
vehicles, is said to have, been the largest
burial cortege ever seen iii Blackfoot.
In the death of Airs. Stephens Black
foot has lost, one u'f 'its 4o^>st justly pop
ular women, ns tit knew her was lint to
love her. Her sweet, smiling face and
pleasant countenance was noted at
home ami abroad, ami those who had
not the pleasure of a spenkRig acquaint
ance with her admired the kindly
light of her eves, which seemed to
shine for nil, regnnlles»of their social
or financial rating. Kindness and gen
erosity were depicted on her madonna
like face, where no trace of affectation
or haughty pride was ever seen. She
was one of the noblest of Women, a
wife and mother whose dentil is an irre
parable loss to her grief-stricken hus
band ami three sous, nml a loss to
Blackfoot that will not soon be for
gotten.
