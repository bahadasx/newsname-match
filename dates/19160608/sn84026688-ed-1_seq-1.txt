FISH FALL UPWARD TO DEATH SECOND PHANTOM SHIP ;
Some Deep Sea Inhabitants Construct
ed to Withstand Great Pressure,
Come to Surface by Accident.
Perhaps the most curious accident
that can befall any of God’s creatures
is the strange death sometimes visit
ed upon deep-sea fish. They seem to
reverse the ordinary law of gravita
tion and literally fall upward, Just as
land creatures fall downward, unable
to halt their tumble.
The pressure of water in the depths
of the sea is tremendous and the crea
tures which inhabit those regions
have bodies so constructed that they
can swim at ease in this burdensome
element. Now and then one will by
accident stray above the strata of wa
ter in which It lives and arrive at a
height where the water pressure is
greatly lighter. The gases within
them and their swimming bladders
then expand and they become as
though filled with gas.
For a certain distance the mus
cles can counteract this ballooning
tendency and it can fight its way back
to safely and comfort, but the mo
ment the fish get* beyond the limit
and the muscles become ineffective,
it becomes helpless and is borne up
ward to the surface of the ocean by
the continually expanding gases.
FRESH AIR A MILK PRODUCER
Largest Returns Need Not Be Ex
pected From Animals Where Barns
Are Poorly Ventilated.
Ventilation of barns usually is even
more deficient than window space and
to this lack of proper ventilation vet
erinarians attribute, in a large meas
ure, the prevalence of tuberculosis.
But, aside from safeguarding the
health of both the owner’s family and
his cattle, good ventilation is econ
omy.
Perfect assimilation of food Is no
more possible In the body of an ani
mal without a sufficient supply of air
than is perfect combustion of fuel In
a furnace with the draft closed.
In order that milk cows or beef ani
mals may respond to an increased ra
tion o£ feed, more air must be supplied
for its combustion as surely us that
a furnace requires more air for a
heavy than a light fire.
In other words —the amount of milk
or beef produced by the animal and
the amount of heat produced in the
furnace depend as much on the air
supply as on the amount of food and
fuel.
If a barn Is poorly ventilated It Is
futile, therefore, to expect the largest
returns in beef or milk for the feed
consumed.

"FLYING DUTCHMAN" SAID TO
HAVE A RIVAL.
Both French and Yankee Fishermen
Shun Cove Where They Believe
the Ghostly Vessel Seeks
Refuge.
It Is said that the French fisher
men from the Magdalen Islands and
the matter-of fact Yankee skippers of
Bangor alike shun the shores of Bay
Chaleur after dark and refuse to put
In at Dead Man’s cove, under any cir
cumstances, preferring to run the risk
of foundering in a hurricane In the
open sea to sharing the shelter of the
cove with the “phantom ship.”
This famous specter of the sea Is
said to appear only in the calm pre
ceding a groat storm with every stitch
of canvas drawing and her decks
swarming with men, all running to and
fro as if in a panic. Ahead of her the
water Is like glass, behind her the
gale comes tearing along, beating up
the sea into froth and driving her
straight on through everything in her
way. She is an ancient model, full
rigged and gray all over—hull, upper
works, sails and spars—as it formed
of fog. Gray, too, Is her ghastly crew.
The Inhabitants of St. Pierre tell ot
a smack on a herring trip that found
herself right In the track of the “phan
tom ship.’’ Captain and crew had heard
of the ghostly vessel, but scoffed at It,
and when they saw her loom up in the
twilight straight ahead they thought a
collision Imminent and the startled
steersman put the helm over. The sea
wraith swept down upon them, and in
the space of a breath had passed right
through them and was racing madly
astern In the direction of Dead Man’s
cove. A fishing schooner from Magda
len Island, warned by the thickening
sky of an approaching storm, put in
at the cove to ride out the gale. Be
fore It had reached an anchorage a
ship was seen coming rapidly behind
also heading for the cove. As It drew
near the captain got out his glass to
see If he knew the stranger, Suddenly
he dropped to his knees and com
menced to pray. “Boys," he yelled, “It’s
a ghost. I saw a sea gull fly right
through her mainsail!” Every man
threw himself on his face’in an agony
of terror, afraid to look. The first to
raise his head and look over the rail
was the cabin boy. “Oh, get up; get
up, all of you,” ho shouted, "she’s
gone.’’ The crew lost no time in mak
Ing sail out of the cove In the teeth ol
a black squall.
Another story Is that of a smack
from St. Pierre which saw the phan
tom anchored just inside the cove at
sunset. A small boat tilled with men
was making trips between the gray
ship and the beach, at each trip un
loading boxes and barrels which other
men waiting ashore buried in the sand.
The captain did not wait to see
whether they were Interring dead men
or chests of treasure, but got away
from the place as fast as he could.
Old sailors along the Maine coast firm
ly believe that the "phantom ship” Is
a merchantman that went down with
all on board trying to reach the cove
In a great storm in 1784; but at St
Pierre the fishermen believe it is a
pirate haunting the spot where the
buccaneer crew hid the treasure for
which they lost their souls.
Tommy Poses for the Films,
The human side of Tommy is delight
fully manifested when he is under the
fire of the cinema camera —and knows
It. Occasionally a man loudly will an
nounce that "my face will not be In the
picture,” but when the Him is displayed
It usually happens that he is one of the
most prominent details of the incident.
Generally the men love the Idea of be
ing shown on the screen in what they
call "movie shows.”
The officer and war office operators
who are organizing the pictorial his
tory of the war have had some quaint
experiences. The soldiers no sooner
catch sight of the operators at work
than they begin to pose for the part.
As a rule the first thing Is to light a
cigarette, to set the cap at a rakish tilt
and to adopt a general air of extreme
nonchalance. Others handle their rifle
with a demeanor of heroic ferocity,
while a few affect the “Charlie Chap
lin” style, as though the whole thing
were a joke.—London Chronicle.
Novel Gas Holders.
The floating bell form of gas holder,
with Its telescoping sections, water
tank seal for the lower edge and elab
orate framing for guiding the cylinder,
is a very expensive structure, and it
has not been evident bow it could be
Improved. A new principle has, how
ever, been devised that greatly sim
plifies the construction and reduces
the cost. Instead of being movable,
the tank is fixed, and its root is mov
able, sliding up and down witbin. This
roof is fitted as closely as possltte,
and to prevent the gas escaping wa
ter is pumped on to it, thus forming
a water seal. Of course, some water
passes through the joint, but this is
withdrawn and returned to the roof by
a pump regulated to compensate for
the leakage.
Song Was Appropriate.
They had been engaged to be mar
ried fifteen years, and still he had
not mustered courage enough to ask
her to name the happy day. One eve
ning be called in a romantic frame of
mind, and asked her to sing some
thing tender and touching, something
that would move him. She sat down
at the piano and sang, "Darling, 1 Am
Growing Old.”
| Criminals 8
5 By HAROLD CASTER 8
(Copyright, ISIU, by W. O. Chapman.)
“Red’s” last stretch had been for
nine years. He had gone Into the
penitentiary at thirty-five, and he came
out at forty-four, an embittered man.
What had been gall and wormwood to
him during the latter portion of his
imprisonment had been the cessation
of news from the outside world.
He had thought of all bis pals, he,
“Red” Crofts, known as the cleverest
counterfeiter that had ever < ome un
der the eye of Ln>-io Baui. Ho had
thought of the men who betrayed him
and were at ease; but be had thought
most of his son, a boy of ten when he
was caught on the last lap of the en
graving that was to pvt u.o thousand
in nls pocket, and giva buU leisure
from crime.
His wife was dead, thank God!
Even a counterfeiter may have family
feelings, and “Red” bad loved with
all ids heart the little woman who died
with a loving look in her eyes and on
her lips the words.
"Bring up Jimmy to be a good man
like his father!”
The irony of It had bitten deep!
Then he turned to his trade again. He
was caught, and the lad was placed
in an Institution. There was no chance
of finding him. “Red” had not a soul
In the world to rail his friend.
The week before he was released
"Red” was surprised to receive a visit
from a big employer of labor, who,
without ceremony, offered him a posi
tion at thirty-five dollars a week in his
engraving department.
"I’ve heard of you,” he said, “and
you may understand that besides my
I
"Red” Confronted the Palp.
business Interests I have a human
one—philanthropy. I want to help men
who are willing to help themselves.
The warden has talked about you.
He says you’ll be back In six months.
I said you wouldn’t. 1 need a skilled
man like you. Will you come and
forget your past?”
“You philanthropists make me
slrk!” growled ‘‘Red,’ who had been
thinking of the boy.
The manufacturer, wise In his knowl
edge of men, only smiled. “Ask for
Mr. Harris at the engraving works,”
he said. "You can think it over. The
Job will be open for a month.”
“Red” did not deign to answer him.
He sat down on his stool and burled
his face in his hands. All the past
memories came thronging back. Once
ho had been a decent lad. Ha had not
been “Red” then, and he had moved
among people Who could not have Im
agined the subsequent life. Then had
come temptation, In the shape of a
crook who had spotted his talent.
“Red” had seen easy money before
him and had succumbed.
He thanked God that his wife had
never known. “Red” had been “Mr.
Crofts, churchgoer and respected In
their suburban homo. “Red” was as
secretive with his pals as he was with
the United States detectives. Only
once a year he emerged Into the un
derworld to help out with another Job
and take home another year’s supply
of capital. The shrewdest man In the
game, be had long baffled Uncle Sam.
“Red” cursed bitterly as the cell
door clanged behind Harris. Why, he
knew just whore to make ample re
turns for his Imprisonment. “Red"
could walk Into any counterfeiters’
headquarters and there would be a cry
of joy. "Red” was the most wanted
man among the criminal fraternity of
America. None so shrewd as he, no
hand so steady.
And he would avenge himself ten
fold. He would find "Father” Tom
Costlgan, the man whom the detectives
had never got yet, the graybeard of
seventy-five who had lured him to
his own downfall. “Father” kept a
warm spot In his heart for “Red.”
“Red” could hardly endure the de
lays of the last few days. He smacked
his lips as in imagination he saw him
self at work upon the steel plates.
“Red” felt the glamor of the old world
anew. He squared his shoulders as
he left the penitentiary gates In his
new suit, and laughed defiantly at the
of the warden.
He made his way to New York. He
knew that “Father” was still alive.
The death of so great a man would
have rung through the walle of every
penitentiary in the country Inside of
a few days.
And be found "Father” exactly
where he had expected—ln Regan’s
restaurant. “Father'’ kept to his old
habits at seventy-three. Trailed day
and night, “Father” laughed in the de
tectives’ faces. He had a genius for
organization; he knew how to select
others to do the dirty work for him.
“Red” slunk in to Regan’s, for now
he felt the prison shame upon him, and
the place had changed somewhat; it
was gaudier and more glaring. But
nobody knew him, and in a moment
he had spotted “Father" In the old
comer. "Red” was deciding whether
he should cross the restaurant to him
when he realized that “Father” was
talking to the young fellow who sat
opposite him, the two fenced in be
tween the pewlike structures that Re
gan’s affects.
The memory of his own downfall
came strongly over him. Ho had been
Just such a chap as this bright-eyed
boy who was bending forward and
listening to old “Father’s” arguments.
“Red" slipped out of his seat, and,
unseen by "Father,” took a place in
the seat behind the old man. The pew
like construction concealed him com
pletely. but round the edge of the
pew adjacent to the window “Red’s”
sharp ears could catch the low-spoken
words.
"It’s a cinch," “Father” was saying.
“You’re a fool, boy, to worry over
losing that job. Every man’s a grafter;
the ones who succeed are simply those
who don’t get found out."
Age had not dulled the edge of "Fa
ther’s” tongue. Just the same words
“Father” had used to him, “Red,” in
those years so long gone by. “Father”
had made a crook of many a decent
man with his damnable sophistries.
"I don’t know,” muttered the boy.
"I’ve got to live, and I—l’m tempted,
Mr. Costlgan. If I’d ever known my
mother it might have been different."
"Oh, women don’t understand," said
“Father.” “God bless all good women,
I say. But it’s a man’s world, boy, and
a man has to fight with all means In
ills power. Now that engraving abil
ity of yours Is simply genius Crofts—"
‘‘Red” started as If an electric shock
had gone through him. “Crofts!” It
was not a common name. And his boy
would be about that age. And the
hereditary engraving power, which he
himself had Inherited from his own
father! And the look In the boy’s
eyes that had attracted him as a mag
net. Rlood found Its own!
"Red” leaped from his seat and con
fronted the pair. He saw the amazed
recognition flame Into ‘•Father’s” face.
"Red” raised one wrist, the muscles
herd as steel. "Father” winced. He
dodged the blow.
But the blow did not fall. "Father"
was an old man, and "Red” was too
happy to find the boy, to see him
standing before him, alarm on his
face, wonder, stupefaction, In his
eyes.
“Red” linked his arm through the
lad’s and led him from the restaurant
unresisting. At the door, however,
the boy stopped and freed himself.
“You are—you are —” he stammered.
"Your father,” said "Red” softly.
“And God sent me to you at just the
instant, Jimmy. You’re coming home
with me now. and —and I guess we’ll
run straight together.”

he operates at lightning speed, hum

His tall is a combination of two wire

them near the middle and sometimes
he brings the pair of ‘'rackets” at the

Odd Watch Crystal*.
A celluloid watch crystal which will
be as good as a glass one, and far
more durable, will fill a long-felt want.
Anyone wearing a watch Is liable to
break the glass crystal In an accident
at any time. One reason for the popu
larity of open-face watches Is that they
are provided with heavier crystals
than the timepieces with hunting
cases, and, unless the cases are extra
stiff, they will give sufficient under
moderate pressure to cause the glass
beneath to break. The celluloid crys
tal Is said to have been successfully
made and used.

EOUR CORNERS TO HUSBAND
They are Ability, Reliability, Endur
ance and Action, Would-Be
Wives Are Informed.
Girls ot today would make better
and more practical marriages If they
were taught to study the qualifications
of the men they meet and to consider
them in the same light as they do al
gebra problems at school, was the
statement made by Mrs. Frank De
chant at the Parents’ association
meeting in the school of practice at
Fhiladelphla.
Mrs. Dechant drew a square on the
blackboard, its four corners indicating
what, she said, were the four neces
sary adjuncts to a good husband —
ability, reliability, endurance and ac
tion. To discover whether a man has
these qualifications, she declared, was
the problem every girl has to solve at
least once in her lifetime, and she
should be as carefully trained for it as
she is for her school examinations.
She advocated mothers talking over
with their daughters the characteris
tics of the young men they knew, not
only to gain their opinions on the sub
ject, but to give advice and counsel to
them for their future life.
Every girl, she said, should be sure
that the man she chooses has an
abundance of the four qualifications
before she makes up her mind to mar
ry him, and she can only be sure it
she has been taught and trained be
forehand in a calm, dispassionate man
ner.
She also advocated talks on homo
making, division of income and pra&
tical methods of housekeeping as a
part of all girls' education, whether
they are working girls or not.
Lead Cables Perforated by Beetle.
A discovery of much importance to
telephone and electrical engineers In
the United States was recently an
nounced by Albert Schuler, general
manager of the Santa Barbara (Cal)
Home Telephone company. After five
years of persistent effort to determine
the cause of minute holes In the lead
armor of aerial telephone cables, Mr
Schuler established beyond question
that the holes are bored by a compara
tively small beetle with powerful man
dibles. For years the telephone com
pany was by short circuits
in the aerial cables due to minute
holes in the armor, resulting from
some unknown cause. Electrical ex
perts who were consulted ridiculed
the suggestion that the holes were
caused by insects and laid the trou
ble to electrolysis. Several men who
were detailed to travel along the line
and watch out for suspicious bugs
were soon rewarded for their trouble.
They captured a number of bugs in
the act of drilling into the lead armor
of the cables. Specimens of the bug
were sent to Doctor Van Dyke, en
tomologist at the University of Cali
fornia, who classified them as Sin
oxyion decllve, a kind of beetle that
ordinarily attacks wood, particularly
live oak logs or cord wood. —Scientific

In Shakespeare, 30 Letters
It Is rather remarkable, as Miss El
len Terry pointed out in her address
at His Majesty’s theater recently, that,
despite the multitude of books which
have been published about Shake
speare’s plays, little attention has been
given to the letters therein, the Lon
don Chronicle observes.
They number thirty In all, hut easily
escape attention. In fact, when Miss
Terry asked three friends what they
knew of the subject, two of them could
not recall any letters at all, while the
knowledge of the third does not extend
beyond the letters occurring 'in the
“Merry Wives of Windsor” and “The
Merchant of Venice.” These are let
ters made familiar through the me
dium of the theaters.
No single one of Shakespeare's let
ters, written as a man and not as a
playwright, has survived, but those In
the plays were, like the plays, perfect.
They always fell naturally Into the
story. In the ordinary play letters are
usually employed to give a clumsy
explanation from the dramatist be
cause he has not the skill to do it in
any other way.
Food Troubles In Paris.
After having tried, luckily without
success, to interfere with the sale of
bread and wine, our excellent deputies
now ask us to adapt our stomachs to
the use of dog grease instead of but
ter, remarks the Crl do Paris. Cer
tain Interests have appeared to pro
pose, In effect, a law “to facilitate the
sale of margarine and oleomargarine,
products of which the qualities nearly
approach those of butter,” in the same
localities where butter Is made and
sold. These deputies are full of good
intentions, but their Ignorance fully
equals their good will. In principle,
the name of margarine should be but
ter by color, consistence, odor and
taste. But in practice It is quite differ
ent. The word “margarine” has be
come a term that Is applied to all fats
of vegetable or animal origin. When
there is a superabundance In time of
peace some fine soaps are made with
margarine obtained from the cadavers
of animals that have perished. But
are we to be obliged to eat It in time
of war?
Army of Monaco Dissolved.
The army of Monaco, though small,
was resplendent during peace times,
but now that war Is under way It has
been dissolved because the profes
sional soldiers who composed It have
all been called home and are fight

ors, as the case may be, or drawn up
in the Swiss contingents guarding the
frontier. . _ v . t

TOM AND DICK
By ISABEL LEE
Tom's wife sat before her dressing
table putting the finishing touches to
her afternoon toilet.
“Little do you know how worried I
am," Tom's wife sighed pathetically.
“But I won’t bother you with my
troubles. You have so much to be
happy about and so many plans to
make for the wedding."
Dick’s fiancee bit her pretty lips.
“I'm not at all sure there is going to
be any wedding," she said.
“I don't even know whether to go
down to shop or not,” added the
younger woman. “Whats the use of
getting the things when I don’t know
whether I shall want wed
ding veil and white satin and the
rest? But don’t talk about poor little
me. I’d so much rather know why
you are worrying.”
Tom’s wife laughed softly. "First
It was the teacup,” she said. “It was
the morning he asked me for a lem
on. The next evening he had a mys
terious little package when he came
home. It was a horrid, sticky, teacup.
“Well, the next night It happened
again—such a horrid old cup. That
kept on for several days. I asked him
outright what it was all about.
“ ‘Well, you have caught me, snook
ems, haven’t you?’ Those were the
very words he used, and then ho
laughed a little, rather sheepishly,
and tried to kiss me. T didn’t want
to tell you at first,’ he said. ’I thought
you’d make a fuss about it. But that
new English secretary— ’
“That new English secretary—and
that was the first time that I had
even heard of the creature —he said
had to have tea. They all do in Lon
don, be said.
“ ‘You’ve never had tea with me,’ I
said, 'and now for this brazen English
secretary. But why make a fool of
yourself by bringing the cups home?’"
“ ‘Thats where the Joke comes in,*
he said laughing. T thought of get
ting Miss Stebbins to wash them, but
she rebelled.’
” ‘Just because I am a woman, 1
suppose you think I must do the
drudgery. I never washed a dish in
my life. If you want a servant you
should have hired one, and not a
stenographer,’ said Miss Stebbins.
“T am sure I don’t at all blame
Miss Stebbins,* I said.”
"You did perfectly right,” said
Pick’s fiancee. “I know all about It.
I found Dick carrying not only one,
but two cups home at night—his and
the secretary’s. He even brought
them around to wash, and then he
told me. Just as Tom did you, about
the creature. Only he wouldn’t say
much and I said leas. I didn’t want
him to tell you that I was Jealous and
It Is not really that. Only, of course,
if that Is the kind of man Dick is, it
he is the sort who stoops to office flir
tations.”
“Have you seen her?” Inquired
Tom’s wife, patting away an Imagin
ary tear through the meshes of her
▼ell.
"Heavens, no, and I don’t want to,
Of course, she Is a tall, willowy,
blonde. English women so often are.”
The idea seemed to occur to them
both at once of stealing unexpectedly
Into the office where Tom and Dick
held their tea orgies every afternoon.
And in less than half an hour the two
women had started downtown with all
the Intense excitement of a real ad
venture.
"It isn’t as If wo were doing any
thing underhanded,” assured' tom’s
wife. "For I am sure any wife has a
right to call at her husband’s office.
Do you suppose they sent way tq
London for her? I don’t see why
they couldn't have got some honest,
deserving American girl who would
have been quite satisfactory.”
They had reached the office and
Tom’s wife went in first. Tom and
Dick were both in and showed no end
of pleasure at the visit. They took
them right Into Tom’s big, roomy of
fice.
“ ‘Stick around for a half hour
more,” Tom said, “and you can have
tea with us. Its a great Institution,
isn’t it, Dick?”
Both Tom’s wife and Dick’s fiancee
smiled coldly. But It was part of
their plot to stay. They peered around
every curve and listened for every
sound, expecting to see the willowy
blonde appear. But the only petti
coats they saw were worn by the
sourfaced Miss Stebblns, who sat
pounding away relentlessly at her
typewriter.
"Maybe we can get the ladies to
wash up the dishes,” suggested Tom,
"It’s such a nuisance to have to cart
them home with us,”
Toms wife had her cue and, while
Dick’s fiancee fairly trembled at what
she felt was bound to follow, she be
gan:
“It seems to me that the English
secretary had better do the dishwash
ing, since it was the English secre
tary's idea to have tea.”
Tom and Dick began to laugh.
"That's a good one,” said Tom, and
then, at his summons, a tall, fine-look
ing, middle-aged, well-tailored man
appeared.
"The wife says you ought to wash
the dishes,” Tom repeated with a
laugh, and then he introduced them
all. You see It was Mr. Harry Harri
son, the new London secretary of the
company, whom Tom and Dick wanted
favorably to Impress and not that
mythical, willowy blonde at all.
