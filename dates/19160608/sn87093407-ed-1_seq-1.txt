HF. DIDN'T SAY THIS FOR PUBLICATION AND
HE DIDN'T SAY IT TO'A REPORT!!R. HF. SAID IT
TO AN AMBASSADOR OF THE OLD GUARD SENT
TO NEGOTIATE ABOUT POSSIBLE TERMS OF

But if I should give the name of the progressive leader
who said this he would instantly deny that he ever said it, or
thought of saying it.
He would deny that the progressives under any circum
stances could, would or should tolerate the name of Hughes.
He would say these things with solemn imprecations and
loud noise as if he himself believed in his denial.
And he would denounce me seven ways as a liar and a
low person, and all the other politicians that knew ho said
that thing would also deny it and denounce me, because I
should be transgressing the good old rules of the game and
giving the inside of the outside things.
AND YET ALL OF THEM WOULD KNOW THAT
I WAS BUT TELLING THE TRUTH.

Appeal for Unity
to Republicans
By Perry Arnold
CHICAGO, June B—The repub
/ lican national convention marked time today
■'•p/ awaiting its platform framers' report.
In the marking time process, the dele-
Ra'f* were treated to a session of oratory by
such old-time wheel horses as Cliauncey M.
— DePew and Uncle Joe Cannon, with Sen.
Win. E. Borah, of the newer day, thrown in for good measure.
If the plans of the (». O. P. leaders go thru as per the
schedule on which they were arranging things in the early
afternoon, the •■ession beginning at 4 p. m., to which hour
the convention recesscd, will be a two-hour discussion of the
platform. •
It was first reported all over the hall that a scheme was
bring fathered by a number of the Old Guard to continue the,
session thru the afternoon and evening until a candidate wai
nominated
Chairman Harding, however, gave it as his opinion that
there would be no nominating speeches until tomorrow
morning.
Roosevelt's Announcement Does
Not Get Rise Out of G. O. P. Leaders
Col. Roosevelt's announcement that he would journey to
Chicago if the republican convention invited him to do so,
did not get a rise out of the republicans.
The big leaders read the statement with unconcealed
interest, T>ut none made any comment.
From all outward appearances the convention was no
nearer its choice of a nominee today than yesterday.
There was, however, a very noticeable increase in pep
among the delegates, in the number of persons in the gal
leries, and in the spontaneity of the cheering.
Sen. Fall's statement that he will place Roosevelt's name
in nomination has brought to the "Old Guard" the ear of a
possible stampede for the colonel
Roosevelt's message from Oyster Bay today, in response
to the invitation sent him by Delegate Wm. B. Jackson of
Maryland to come to Chicago and address the convention,
isn't adding to their restfulness.
Colonel Says He'll Go to Chicago
If Convention Will Invite Him
Gov. Whitman, Hughes' backer, only smiled at tht
colonel's statement.
"Col. Roosevelt is always interesting and a leading Amer
ican," Harding said, "hut the chairman has no authority to
invite and recognize him as a speaker except on order of the
convention."
"There is no move to invite him," commented Secretary
Reynolds of the national committee.
Roosevelt's telegraphed message said:
"In answer to your telegram, I can only say that the mat
ter lies with the republican convention, and that if the con
vention desires me to address it, I shall he glad to do'so.
"1 very earnestly hope that the republicans and pro
gressives assembled at Chicago will keep steadily in mind the
gravity of this crisis, not only for America, but for the world,
and the need that their action, in dignity, foresight and patriot
ism, shall rise level to the crisis.
"1 hope that die aim will not merely be to nominate a
man who can be elected next November, but a man of such
power, character, steadfast conviction and proved ability that
it elected he will again place this nation where it belongs.
Declares President Has Rendered
Nation an Evil Service
"President Wilson, however amiable his intentions, ha«
rendered to this people the most evil service that can be ren
dered to a great democracy by its chosen leader.
"He has dulled the national conscience and relaxed the
spring of lofty, national motives, by teaching our people to
accept high-sounding words as the offset and atonement for
shabby deeds and to use words which mean nothing in order
to draw all meaning from those which have a meaning.
"The difference-, that have divided, not merely republi
cans and progressives, but good Americans of all shades of
political beliefs, from one another in the past, sink into noth
ing when compared with the issues now demanding decision
- for these issues are vital to the national life.
"They are the issues of a unified Americanism and of
national preparedness.
Sooner or Later, if We're Not Prepared,
We Must Yield to Alien Conqueror
"If we are not thoroly prepared, if we have not developed
a strength which respects the rights of others but which is
also ready to enforce others' respects for their own rights,
then sooner or later we shall have to submit to the will of
an alien conqueror.
"These questions are not in the realm of abstract thought.
They must be taken out of the world of cloudy promise and
vague phrasing into the world of performance and fact.
"They are today in concrete torm before you and your
fellows for your decision."
"For two years, In the face of
awful world cataclysm, thla nation
haa stood supine and helpless and
has not In the smallest degree pre
pared itself to ward off the danitr.
"No promise, no excuse, now
made by tlioho rcs|K>nsibie for this
inaction is entitled to considera-
