cigarette unless you get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco!
P. A. comes to you with a real reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch !
You can smoke it long and hard without a come
back! Prince Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give quality!
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
enjoyment! And that flavor and fragrance and
coolness is as good as that sounds. P. A. just
'answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!
Introduction to Prince Albert isn't any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A." You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it's the cheer
fullest investment you ever made!

Another Point.
The railway authorities assert that
to meet the demands of the cm
ployes, the railroads would have to
J find about 100,000,00d a year to add
to their payrolls. It probably would
nottop there,for if the roads have to
pay an advance to their employes in
train service, who are now relatively
well paid, they will have to advance
the wages of all other classes of labor.
Railroad officials say they cannot
meet the demands on their present
revenues. Their annual statements
indicate that such is the fact. That
is their problem. It does not concern
the employes who are demanding
higher wages and shorter hours. But
it should concern the public. Every
citizen will have to bear his share of
the coBt and suffer his share of the
inconvenience which an interruption
to railroad service must entail. The
question for the publio to consider.
therefore, is whether it is willing to
assume an additional burden so that a
favored group, which has the econom
ic power to enforce its demands, may
be still more highly favored. That is
the proposition in a nutshell from an
impartial publio point of view.
"Big Business" in Small Town Firms.
"The small town merchant too often
is of the opinion that it is impossible
for him to compete with the mail or
der house In big city," says J. B
Powell, Instructor in advertising in
the University of Missouri at Colum
bia. This idea is wrong, according to
Mr. Powell, who says that if "big
business" methods are adopted by
small concerns the annual jvrofits will
be as large proportionately as those of
laree mail order houses which send
out beautifully decorated catalogs.
Strict adherence to an accurate
system of bookkeeping, competent
clerks, store service and judicious ad
vertising are some of the methods of
"big business." Mr. PowellJ urges,
About 6 percent of the year's gross
sales should be expended each year
for advertising medium. Care in the
writing of advertisements should be
one 0( the most important pans oi
the "big business" system, according
to Mr. Powell.
Democratic voters would be disap
pointed It the Globe-Democrat and
Pee Dee were approving Democratic
State officials. Knowing the principle!
controling these newspapers and the
selfish interests they serve, both
politics and business, Democrats know
beyond the peradventure of a doubt,
that Democratic officials not receiving
excoriations from these organs would
hot be carrying out Democratic prln
oiplea In the conduct of State affairs
There la nothing the G.-D. and the
Pee Dee love to bate quite so much aa

The Best Proof.
Ironton Citizens Cannot Doubt It.
Doan's Kidney Pills were used
They brought benefit.
The story was told to Ironton resi
dents.
Time has strengthened the evidence
Has proven the result lasting.
The testimony is from this locality.
The proof convincing.
Joseph Knagge, Fredericktown,
Mo., says: "Walking, stooping or
lifting always gave me backache and
the sharp pains kept me in misery.
Tbe kidney secretionB were scanty
and painful in passage. Una box of
Doan's Kidney Pills greatly relieved
me."
GONE FOB GOOD
More than five years later, Mr.
Knagge Baid: "I am entirely free
from kidney trouoie now and don't
have any more backache. I give
Doan's Kidney Pills credid for this."

Quiet Joya.
The joys that are bought with monoy
are worth nothing compared with the
Joys that, though sweet and gentle and
unassuming, are yet deep, enduring
and quieting; the joys that enlarge the
heart instead of diminishing it, and
which we too often pass by some
what in the manner of those peasants
whom one sees in an ecstasy over the
fireworks at some fete, and who pay
not the smallest attention to the splen
dor of a summer night. Sabatier.
