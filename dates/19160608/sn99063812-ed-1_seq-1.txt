A big riot broke this afternoon when
tlarfleld of Ohio moved the appoint
incut of a committee to confer with
tho republicans. IfoWas bootted, as
was Olfont Pinchot'x second to the
motion.
During the debate, Murdock of
Kansas urged tbe nomination of Roose
velt at one. Bedlam reigned.
"1 favor harmony, but 1 want
harmony both ways," said Murdock.
"fibtlJ we kne-tl to the old crowd at
tbe CoUaef YellHjof '.Vol" came
fronTall side of tbe bouse, and the
delegate arose, shouting for Roose
velt. One delegate arose to make a speech
for unity, but be was bowled down.
During tbe clamor, the gavel repeated
ly rapped for order.
In tbe long run, a resolution for a
conference was Inally adopted.' Tbts
apparently defers tbe Roosevelt nom
ination, pending negotiations.
Oyster Bay advices say tbe colonol
l expected to leave for Chicago to

Russian successes agulnst the Aus--tie-Herman
uie developing southward
from the Prlpot river, along a 2E0-mlle
front. Russian ndvlces claim big cap
tures of men, munitions and arms.
In this offensive, which Is declared
to be 'a carefully coordinated move-,
ment, the Russians are said to have a
plentiful supply of ammunition and
men and with tho roads now in good
condition their maneuvers are ex
pected to develop swiftly. The number
of the Teutonic allies facing tbe Rus
sians Is reported to be about 600,000
men.

"Roosevelt Is always interesting, bat
the chair has no authority to Invite

members of tbe county republican con
tra! committee, which has been called
for 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon at
the court bouse, Is attracting consider
able Interest Committeemen In twenty-three
of tbe twenty-nine precincts
In the county were elected, but there
was a tie vote in three of these pre
cincts. Tbe successful candidate will
havo to bo decided upon and vacancies
tilled by tbe certlled members.
There Is much speculation as to who
will be selected as chairman, as this
official will have tbe burden of hand-
Mar the campaign tbla fall. It Is not
known whether R. A. Bmmitt, the pros
ent chairman, will seek reelection or
not. there Is a feeling that he has
dlsquallled himself by hla activity at
sPk tho primary election In attempting to
select a personally picked ticket. The
fact that every one of his publicly sup
ported candidates was defeated ai the
election; has not added to his strength
as a political leader.
As the expense of tho fall campaign
will havo te be berae mainly by the
repuWleaa candidates, there la a feel
ing that the.cbalrman selected should
be a man known to be friendly and
occeplaUV to thane candidates, Aa
Mr. Hmmttt opposed practically every
nucceseful candidate on the republican
ticket at tho primaries, it to believed
be will recognise the impropriety of
Huplring to the chairmanship.
Sentiment among republicans in tbe
county aeenu to favor n more repre
sentative rganUaUen than has ob
tained In the Mat, with now Mood at
the hand. It to argwad that men who
In the paKt should give way, for tho
good of the party, to newer men who
are not handicapped by political en
mule of tho past, and would thus be
bettor able to prbmoto a stronger or
ganization. Amnnir Din niitne.- hearil montionud
n possible cnndldatcB for chairman oi
tbe committee are : Judge A. u Leav
itt. Dr. Oeo. If. Meiryman nnd W. H, A.
Rcnncr.
Judgo Leavltt has been In politics
In Klamath county about as long as
"Mob" Emmltt. No ono seems to know
iust when either of them started. Leav
Itl's experience, however, has been
more ns n candidate and office holder
than as a political "boss," and ho has
rendered soma valuable assistance In
the counsels of tho, party In the past
Dr. Merryman, former stnto senator,
has takon a part In many of tho cam
paigns In tho past, but haa not been
active polltlcnllly for the past two
years. It Is not believed that he would
consent to neglect his business to as
aume tho management of a political
campaign-
W, H, A. Renner, In comparison to
tbe other men mentioned, Is practical
ly 'a nw " H we,t known In
the legal profession, here and during
his six years residence has acquired a
ouneMerable acquaintanceship through
out the county. This is the nrst year
h has. token a very active interest
In politics, but bis active campaign for
Judge Kuykendall proved that he was
an effective and energetic wower.
Those insisting on new blood at the
bead of the organisation are Inclined
to favor meaner far tho pcatton.

The plaintive sweetness of Hawaiian
songs, rendered to the accompaniment
of tho strumming ukuleleB and guitars,
form a combination bard to equal as
u musical entertainment, and aa a con
sequence, all who heard the prelude
concert at Chautauqua this afternoon
by Kckuku's Hawaiian quintet are!
tolling their friends to be sure and at
tend tonight's program by the same
entertainers.
The quintet is composed of members
of tho celebrated Tootn Paka and Bird
of Paradise companies, and members
of the Hawaiian Glee Clubs which
proved such an Immense hit at the
Horticultural Palace, the Hawaiian
building and the California building at 1
tho Panama-Pacific International ex
position. All are splendid singers, and
tholr solo work proved ns pleasing aa
the quintet numbers.
A feature of tbe program all will
enjoy will be tho steel method In
guitar playing, as used In solo work
b Joseph Xekuku, its discoverer. In
this Hawaiian's hands, the guitar to;
made to play tbe most bewitching
music by a slurring aetlon he originat
ed quite by accident, and tbe tones
havo tho same appeal to the ear and
soul as have the strains of the violin.
Tho Hawallaus furnish the closing
program of the Chautauqua. This to
a bill well worth the1 patronage oj all
Klamath" Falto people. - jk
