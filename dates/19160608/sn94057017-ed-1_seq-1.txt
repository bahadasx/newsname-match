.. E. C. Barnes, who is farming
ground not cultivated for a num
V ber of years on his claim north
' west of Mcintosh, is having
trouble with cutworms. He has
replanted, in the hope that the
worms will be gone by the time
the second planting comes on.
H- F. Matthews had six acres
of corn destroyed by cut worms
on ground where there was a
crop of barley last year. They
overflowed and destroyed the
corn on a strip adjoining, amount
ing to an acre or two. They
have not damaged crops on the
balance of his fields.
The school board of Estancia
held a meeting last Saturday for

for the remaining grades.
The New Mexico section of the
government weather report for
April is out. On account of our
May day snow, and a consider
able snow in the mountains May
. 19th, the April report does not
complete the snowfall .record for
the winter, but it will be of in
terest to readers to know what it
was up to the first of May. From
December 1st to May 1st the
record at the different stations in
the county totaled as follows:
Torrance 40 5 inches; Willard
38.1; Estancia 55.1: Bigger's
Ranch (near Moriarty) 47.5;
Rea's Ranch (on Bosque Moun
tain) 198.8. The snow of May
1st makes the record at Estancia
from December 1st to June 1st
57 inches, and the snow of May
1st and 19lh will make the record
in the mountains about 210
inches.
G. C. Merrifield is very much
pleased with rye as a forage crop.
Last year he had a field of rye
which be had pastured pretty
bard and he thought it would not
make much of a grain crop, so
he cut it when in bloom and
made hay of it. He says he
never had better feed. He has
fifteen acres of fall wheat which
has done well up to this time,
but it now needs raia. There is
plenty of moisture in the ground
but the wheat roots do not go
down far enough to get it. He
has had a stand of corn taken by
' cut worms on ground that was
in oats last year, while the
worms have done no material
damage elsewhere in his fields.
Mr. Merrifield is farming heavily
this year. He will have eighty
or ninety acres of beans and
about seventy acres of other
crops.

An officer looking for recruits
for the state troops was in this

Mrs. J. C. Peterson, and her two
daughters Blanche and. Eunice.
of Toledo, Ohio, came the first of

Mountainair Monday on business.
He has increased his acreage a
little this year, and will put in
about 260 acres. He did not get
his plows rigged in time to use
his tractor for plowing this
spring, but will use it tor that
purpose this fall, and also for
threshing.
R. A. Marble has bought the
R. L. Porter ranch, which ad
joins Mr. Marble's land, on the
Torreón draw southwest of Es
tancia. We believe the Porter
ranch comprised four hundred
acres. Mr. Marble has filed on
water sufficient to irrigate three
hundred acres. Mr. Porter came
out from Oklahoma last Saturday
to close up the deal. He tells us
that crop prospects in Kay coun
ty, Oklahoma, are pretty pior on
account of lack of rain. There
had been no rain for five weeks
when he left. Oats were entire-
wheat was badly
ly gone, and
damaged.
During the
our readers
past two months
have been pretty
well posted on the weather by
weekly mention, but a resume
may be of interest. April was a
very unusual April, the precipi
tation having totaled 2.24 inches.
There were 14 windy days and 21
clear days. May, with the ex
ception of the snow on the first,
heretofore mentioned, was dry
as a bone. There were 23 clear
days and 23 windy days. The
winds have- sucked up the sur
face moisture. Plenty of moist
ure is reDorted in the ground in
fields that were cultivated last
year, but ground that has been
growing only weeds for several
years past, and more particular
lv that which was not thorough
ly stirred early, is suffering more
or less. In thistle fields there
are oatches that look dead, and
in a few localities the grass has
stopped growing because the sur
face is dry. However, there is
abundance of grass, the early
growth having been much above
the average.
Mrs. Duke has been quite sick
mis wees, out is reported ím
proving.
George Fenley is building a
nice porch which will be used as
a sleeping porch.
L. W. Jackson appears to be
the champion farmer so far re
ported. He has forty acres of
corn and forty acres of beans,
both a good Btand and both once
over with the cultivator.

gone back to Texas.
Not one Derson in a thnunnnri
living in this glorious country of
ours properly appreciates its lib
eral laws and institutions. Late
ly we have been shocked by the
execution of a number of the
leaders of the Irish rebellion
But here is something which
shows what it is to live under the
merciless despotism of the Ger
man empire: necentiy a peace
congress was held by the Social
ists at Zimmerwald in Switzer
land. For distributing in the
trenches phamphlets concerning
tnis meeting thirty-five Ger
man soldiers Socialists were
shot. News of this incident did
not come through the German
newspapers they would not be
permitted to print such news
but through the Swiss Socialists.
All kinds of paper has ad
vanced in price an average of
about fifty per cent in the past
iew montns. There is an ever
increasing demand and a dimin
ishing supply of everything that
enters into the manufacture of
paper. The government is out
with a suggestion that people
save and bale old paper instead
of letting it go to waste. Many
thousands of tons of old paper
are wasted every year in this
country, which could be used in
the manufacture of the cheaper
grades cf paper and which if
saved would go far toward re
lieving the shortage of material.
It is not probable that men would
find it profitable to collect old
paper and rags in this country,
but boys and women might do it.
If there is a woman's organiza
tion, church society or boys and
girls organization that would like
to look into this matter we would
be glad to co-operate in an effort
to learn what can be got for it
and where it can be sold, but it
would be useless to spend time
and postage investigating the
matter unless there is somebody
who wants to take hold of it.
WOMAN'S CLUB
The Woman's Club met at the
home, of Miss Ruth Crawford
near Mcintosh Friday afternoon,
June 2. Very few were present
owing to the distance from town
Mrs. Stubblefield opened the
meeting, as the president was
absent. Good meeting. The
next meeting will be held in the
Club room June 16, Mrs. Green
hostess. All are urged to be
present. After adjournment
Miss Crawford, assisted by her
brother Wood, served delicious
refreshments which were en
joyed by all.

Santa Fe. June 4. Bedrock
has been struck by test shafts in
the White Rock canyon at two
points near the two banks, but
not thus far in the center of the
stream. .This now assures the
construction of the power dam,
for even though the rock is not
found in the center of the stream.
the dam can be securely built on
the bedrock found near each
bank and the chasm bridged by a
method now in vogue among en
gineers in Norway. The New
York company which has filed
application with the state en
gineer, will modify its plans ac
cordingly and expects to file new
specifications shortly so as to-be-gin
work on the plant that is to
furnish 25,000 horsepower fjr

HAVE YGOWEñK IMS?
QDo colds settle on your chest or in yur
bronchial tubes ? Do coughs hanr on, or
are you subject to throat troubles ?
Such troubles should have immediate
treatment with the strengthening powers
of Scott's Emulsion to guard against
consumption which so easily follows.
Scott's Emulsion contains pure cod liver
oil which peculiarly strengthens the res
piratory tract and improves the quality of
the blood; the ylycerine in it soothes and
heals the tender membranes of the throat.
Scott's is prescribed by the best special
ists. You can get it at any drug store.
