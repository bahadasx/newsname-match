and has had extended correspond
ence with officials of the bureau in
Washington concerning it.
The .survey will deal principally
with malaria, which is very com

will be made to discover the condi

the malady, with the view of taking
steps to abate them.

local freight agent of the Mobile &
Ohio R. R., has issued a statement
showing that 1,014 cars of hay
were shipped from Columbus during
the year ending May 31. Compared
with figures of past years the re
port shows that the shipping of hay
from this city is on the increase, the
amount shipped the past twelve
months being much larger than that
of the previous year.
CITY TO HAVE INDUSTRY
- EXHIEIT NEXT OCTOBER
TAKES PLACE OF PREPARED
NESS PARADE, PLANS FOR
WHICH ARE ABANDONED.
The plan for a preparedness par
ade here on July 4 has been aban
doned, and instead of this pageant
Columbus will have an animal indus
try exhibition next October, and
hopes to make the display one of the
most pretentious undertakings of
similar character ever witnessed in
Mississippi.
The proposed preparedness parade
was abandoned for two reasons, one
being that the directors did not
think Columbus large enough to
stace a creditable pageant of this
character and the other being that
the time intervening between now
and July 4 is too short to get up
any entertainment that will prove a
credit to the city. ' "
The industry exhibition will last
three days, "and the Chamber of
Commerce will at once begin work
on the undertaking with the view of
making it a gigantic sucess.

BRITISH CHIEF IS LOST
WHEN CRUISER SINKS
OFF ORKNEY ISLANDS.
STAFF MEMBERS
ALL LOSE LIVES
Sir William KoberUon Will
" Succeed Kitchener, and Di
rect English Forces.
London, June 6. The news that
Earl Kitchener, secretary of state
for war, and his staff, who were
proceeding to Russia aboard the
cruiser Hampshire, were lost off the
Orkney Islands, was the most stun
ning blow Great Britain has re
ceived since the war began.
This is the second shock the coun
try has sustained within a week. The
other was when the newspapers ap
peared Friday evening with the in
telligence of the naval battle in the
North sea in the form of a list of the
ships lost, with virtually no intima
tion that there was any compensa
tion in the way of enemy losses. The
bulletin telling of the death of
Kitchener gave the country a great
er shock.
Kitchener was the one outstand
ing personality whom the people
talked of and believed in as a great
man, notwithstanding newspaper at
tacks, which at a former period of
the war threatened to undermine his
popularity and the public confidence
in him.
A telegram from Admiral Sir
John JeUicoe, commander of the
fleet, giving the bare facts, was re
ceived at the admiralty about 11
o'clock in the morning. The first of
ficial announcement was issued at
about 1:30 in the afternoon. Such
news, however, cannot be kept en
iitly sicitl' vci' i)i iioji". Be
fore noon rumors were spreading
and the telephones in the newspaper
offices were busy with inquiries anx
ious to know whether this one of
the many reports circulating in
these days of tension had any
foundation. They were told there
was nothing in it.
Admiral Jollicoe's report to the
admiralty was as follows: .
"I have to report, with deep re
gret, that his majesty's ship, Hamp
shire, Capt. Herbert J. Savill, R. N.,
with Lord Kitchener and his staff
on board, was sunk last night about
8 p. m. to the west of the Orkney,
either mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observ
ers on shore to leave the ship. The
wind was north-northwest, and
heavy seas were running. Patrol
vessels and destroyers at once pro
ceeded to the spot and a party was
sent along the coast to search, but
only some bodies and a capsized
boat have been found up to the
present. As the whole shore has
been searched from the seaward, I
greutly f ear . there is little hope
of there being any survivors.
"No report has been received
fi'O.E the search party on sh'.-e.
11. M. S. Hamshire was oti her
waj to Kussia.
Accompanying Earl Kit henei
and his staff were Hugh James
O'Birene, former councillor of the
British embassy at Petrograd, and
former minister at Sofia, O. A.
Fitzgerald, Earl Kitchener's private
military secretary, Brig.-Gen. Eller
shaw, and Sir Frederick Donaldson.
On board the Hampshire with the
Kritiih war secretary were uUo a
ru'i.iier of minor officers.
When the official announcement
finally was issued the fact spread
about London sometime before the
newspapers could get into the
streets. There was a crowd about
the stock exchange which required
police reserves to deal with. The
police told everyone to move on;
that there was no truth in the re
ports.
At the same time another mas3 of
peoDie were assembling about the
government offices in Whitchal; AH
the w'ndows of the war office hal
c.'itn tis lowered. That confirmed
the rumor beyond doubt. Other
crowds gathered about the newspa
per offices; when boys came out with
an armful of extras the people fell
on them and fought for the papers,
In the course of the afternoon the
flags on all buildings were flown at
half staff. ,
The English undoubtedly are
htoical people and have taken the
good and bad tidings of war ai they
cai.ie, with an absence of emotion
.-Li prising to outsiders, but no one
could have walked the London
1 streets today without
perceiving

Chicago, June 6. The decks are

It is the concensus of opinion that
there was more speculation, gossip,
prophecy and conjecture and Icns
real convention news than ever be
fore.
Today, the "old guard," in charge
of the situation though still fear
ful lest it might lose control de
clared: 1. Roosevelt is beaten and hi:
followers in the Republican conven
tion are aiding in the planned de
struction of Hughes.
2. With Hughes eliminated, a
man, mindful of his "real friends,"
and of the "kidney" of the "old
guard" will he nominated.
And yet, Banquo's irhust still pre
sides. The "old guard" is not cock-sure
of itself. The bosses realize, in
other words, that a situation might
be developed in which the servile
delegate will, with success, revolt
against his servitude.
For the Republicans want to
win. If the bosses ride rough shod
over T. R., the "strennuous one."
more able than any other to arous?
the American people, may bolt, with
the inevitable result.
This is sufficient to give the
Losses cause to hesitate. And ns a
result, they may abandon their
fight on Hughes. '
Against Roosevelt? It is not prob
able. They say they have killed Cock
Robin. They entertain fear however
that the corpse may prove a live
one.
It is apparent that the awful
threats of T. R. have had other than
the desired effect have come up as
a vtorm and whispered away like a
summer zephyr. And yet there rs
main" one fatal card. Will T. 1!.
play it?
That is the question which gives
them pause. What would be the ef
fect? Would the delegates, the !
Hood on fire, precipitate a stampce
to Roosevelt? Would they, in other
words, act as Roosevelt would ex
pect them to act?
Who is expressive of merieanism?
Who is patriotic? Who unselfishly,
for the party's good eliminated him
self? Would the delegates, with one
passionate exclamation, answer
Roosevelt?"
The "old guard," even as it
boasts, fears. Quietly, yet assidu
ously, they proceed in laying plana
to make impossible such a contin
gency. And yet it is believed that Uoo
ve.lt's sole remaining chance U to
pin his fate on one lone card and
tecklessly, desperately play it.
Two respectable but humble lob
bies are imploring the adoption of
two new features prohibition nn.l
woman suffrage.
The bosses indicate that the pro

consideration for their feelings. It
f said, however, that the suffragists,'
toasting 4,000,000 votes, will be
la'kened to for a moment.

The New York attorneys, who are
