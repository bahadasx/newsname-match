OVonlng to decide whether or not
tho Club, ns a body would get bac.k
of tho Chautauqua to come to Logan

Club as a body lend tho local guar
antors all the moral support, that it
could, that the club members adver
tise nnd entluiso the people for the
Chautauqua and purchase season
tickets and Induce- other people to do
likewise. If each club member will
purchase n season ticket, nearly half

oration committee of tho Club will
decorate tho streets with flags. The
