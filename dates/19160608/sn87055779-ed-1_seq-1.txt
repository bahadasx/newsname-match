gained a foothold in the fort and
all through the balance of the
night and all day Wednesday the
battle raged with the men at hand-to-hand
grips. It was a bioojy
innilut in trenches and aes and
underground parage w a where
the soldiers grappled like wild
Leasts. In the meantime the bj
German guns were pouring their
salvoes of drumtir against the
French rear ami hurling a urtain

ORPET LOVE LETTERS
WILL GO TO JURY
Prosecutor Plans to Make
Them Keystone of Case
Against Student.
VAFK1:gaX. 111.. June s. The
love letters of Will Orpet. university
student, to Matian Iimbert. the
Itlxe Forest girl, of whose murder he
is accused, have become public prop
erty. The letters run the gamut
ftom infatuation to cold calculation
and are in Hnglish and French. They
may be read to the jury today after
the opening- arguments of the state.
States Atty. Iady thinks they will
prove the keystone in the state's
ca.se against the voting student and
he bases his belief on this supposi
tion: orpet v a.s infatuated with Marian
Lambert. The girl was at first cold
to him. but Orpet won her by hia
impetuosity. Marian Limhert did
not commit suicide. She was not
exeessivelv pedturbed ofer Orpefs
engagement to Miss Youker. Orpet
was in loe with both girls; lie was
loyal to neither; apparently he was
tiiad of one and turned to the other.
Miss Liml.iit believed herself in a
delicate condition. She wrote Orpet.
He gave her cyanide of potassium on
the belief that it would relieve her
condition and killed her after he
had tirst established an alibi to hide
his presem-e in Iake Forest.
The jury to try the case was se
en rani late yesterday after three
weeks and more of effort and the
ase rally began today, w hen State's
Atty. Dady outlined his case to the
jury. After he tinishd he planned
to call Frank Iimbert. the father of
the dead girl as the tirst witness.

AFDITOIUUM. CHICACO. June S.
The progressive committee on per
manent organization has voted to
make Haymond Hobins permanent
chairma n.
Juöt as the juill moose convention
was about to assemble this after
noon, the leaders of the party made
public a telegram from the colonel
to W. P. Jackson of Maryland, in
which Koosevelt declared that he
would come before tlie republican
convention and address it if the
convention no desired.
The prompt reply of tlie colonel
to the telegiam seU him by former
Sen. Jack.-mn, who leads the Mary
land delegation in the repular con
vention -created a sensation. It was
asserted that the regulars would not
dare extend the invitation for fear
of a stampede. Fast conferences
were held among tle old guard and
the progressives eagerly awaited
some information from that side tit
the street as to what effect the tele
gram would have.
In Ihe progressive convention the
telegram had the effect to check a
peneral demand for immediate
nomination so that developments
might come from those authorized
to speak for the coliseum folk.

The gumshoe expedition working
for the intimate triumph of the
oyster Hay leader, started in last
night with the explosion of a few
mines in minor delegations. They
reported to the waiting moose that
a few craters had been occupied
and that prospects were good. Hut
the tangible evidences of success in
forcibly il-agging the guard to the
se;tt of repentance for the crime of
1 f 1 L were not very strong.
More HittoriK'-s üvidcnctnl.
Imbed the night brought evidence
id" more bitterness in some direc
tions. Mayor Hill Thompson's city
payjoll. headed by a band that cost
real money, invaded the moose pre
cincts, where a faithful band was
trying to sing "Teddy's a Hear" to
the accompaniment of a mechanical
organ, and drowned the barber shop
piartet and the faithful chorus of
delegates. It was raining good
and plenty and the moose were wet
and in no mood to be trifled with
by any mere favorite son.
Since the invasion was made in
th name of Sherman, and osten
sibly for his boom the moose
sharpened their horns and rushed
across the street to the Congress
hotel and broke into a Sherman
seance, just by way of reprisal. A
Texas stateman of the moose camp
slugged a Chicago city employe,
bringing the f.rst tlaret of the big
contest. The moose yelled and
there was a starting point for some
more harmony talk based Upon the
idea that if one really wants peace
one must tight.
It is well to keep this in:idetit in
mind. Tag it s the views of the
j rr.nk and ale which is here for the
express purpose of doing the vot

Kosevelt. While their leaders,
headed by Heorge W. Perkins. Wil

Statesman's Duties as Pacifi
cator Prevented His Ac
companying Kitchener.
lUteniiltiotlill NeVVS Npi-yjp;
LONDON, June 8. Hut for the
fateful circumstances that his duties
as pacificator of Ireland kept him at
home, David Lloyd-George, foremost
ci' Hritish statesmen, would have lost
his life along with L.ord Kitchener
on the cruiser Hampshire.
It had been decided, says the Hx
press, that Mr. Lloyd-(ieorge should
accompany the war secretary to
Russia to discuss the question of
munitions for ihe Russian army, but
the duties of mediating the political
troubles in Ireland were so pressing
that it was later decided by the gov
ernor to keep Mr. Lloyd-tleorge at
home and sent Leslie Robertson, of
the ministry of munitions, instead.
Thus the Irish situation, despite
its reriousness. proved a valuable
agency for Great Kritain. for it un
doubtedly saved for tlie government
the powerful and important services
f the talented Lloyd-George.
It has been decided that the me
morial service for Lord Kitchener
shall be held in St. Paul's on June
1.".. Ruth King George and luecn
Mary will attend.
Influential newspapers have al
icady begun campaigns in favor of
arious prominent men as successors?
to lrd Kitchener.
The Graphic is urging the ap
pointment of Herd Derby. The Morn
ing Post favors Hord Milner. The
Times is working for the .appoint
ment of Mr. Lloyd-George.
Say 1 Tench May Get Psi.
A news agency says that the post
has been offered to Viscount John
i rench. former commander-in-chief
of the Rrltish forces in France, and
l ow commander of the home army.
The Daily Chronicle says that the
name of Winston Churchill, former
first lord of the admiralty, has been
discussed in an influential way by
members of the cabinet, but there
are no overpowering indications that
he will get the war portfolio.
Despite the vigorous search, the
body of Lord Kitchener has not yet
been recovered.
The weather off the northern
cast of Scotland is normally stormy
and the tides off the Orkney islands
are strong and variable. In view of
these circumstances it i feaied that
the body may never be found.
Hxpressions of regret and sym
pathy continue to pour in from all
parts of the world. A Ueuter dis

"The news of Kitchener's death
was received here with universal

COLISEUM. CHICAGO. June S.
"Votes for women" will be one
slogan of the republican light for
control of the government next fall.
Woman suffragists today won a hard
fought battle to commit the party to
the principle cf suffrage, and by a
vote of 2$ to 21, the resolutions
committee voted to include the plank
in the convention platform.
The vote of the committee adopt
ed a plank proposed by Sen. Suther
land of Utah, making a general dec
laration of faith in the principle of
woman suffrage. The action of the
committee reversed the action of
the platform sub committee, which
had rejected the plank.
opponents of the suffrage plank
declared that the fight was by no
means over ai d asserted that they
would make a minority report on
the issue, which would precipitate a
struggle on the floor of the conven
tion. The suffragists asserted, how
ever, that they were certain to have
votes enough on the lloor to retain
the plank in the platform.
Prohibition Ijo-rs.
A proposal to incorporate a plank
pledging the party to nation-wide
prohibition was rejected by the com
mittee after a brief discussion. No
formal roll call was taken.
The declaration of a vigorous
republican Mexican policy was
agreed upon today by the plat
form builders of the republican
convention. Informal confer
ences perfected the plank ten
tatively drav.ri up by the sub
committee in charge of the plat
form. After expressing sym
pathy with the Mexican people
and deploring the "murders of
Mexican and American citizens
by lawless bandits," the plank
provides:
"It is the duty of the United
States government to protect
American citizens in their liv
and property both on the Mexi
can border and in Mexico,
wherever they may be found."
This provision was adopted to con
ciliate Sen. Fall of New Mexico, who
as a member cf the sub-committee,
made a fight for an "intervention
plank." .'en. Fall declared that tli
plank was satisfactory to him and
asserted that the demand for the
protection of Americans "in Mexico"
met his demands.
Hunt Middle ( urx
Platform builders exerted every
influence to eliminate any tight in
the resolutions committee and on
the rloor over the "Americanism"

eral terms and they declared that
they would be able to conciliate the
opposition.

WASHINGTON, Jun- . State
department officials today wer'
growing more and more eoneerned
over the danger of a fresh outbreak
among the Mexican people in an en

officials is basec on official dispatches
from American consuls in Mexico
telling of new outbreaks of feeling
against the present rulers, because
of Carranzas seizure of all Mexican
paper money, the only kind of cur
rency most Mexicans possess.
When the p.an -went into opera

News-Times Special:
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June S. Emphatic denunciation of
the Wilson policies and sharp demand that the republican party
refuse to adopt any policy of expediency were the dominant note
of the second day's session of the republican convention. For two
hours the delegates were entertained while waiting for the resolu
tions committee to complete its platform by speeches which left no
doubt of where the leaders of this convention stand.
Chauncey M. Depew and Joseph G. Cannon enunciated the de
mand that the party retain its identity and Sen. William E. Borah,
the biggest outstanding figure in the convention, demanded that the
party put "national honor first and let all else follow."
The convention completed its permanent organization at the
early session and then adjourned to meet again at 5 p. m. It was
expected that by that time the plat
form would be finished. While the
session was in progress the delegates
were electrified to learn that Uol.
Koosevelt had expressed a willing
ness to come to Chicago and address
the delegate's to the convention if
they so desired. It is by no means
certain that the invitation suggested
by Koosevelt will be granted. The
leaders decided that they did not
want Koosevelt here, but they de
cided to confer before bnally dis
posing of the question.
