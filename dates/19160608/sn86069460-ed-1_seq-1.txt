London, June 7. The great

the world has been fought; the
event for which the entire civili

nearly two years has at last oc
curred. The fleets of the British
and German navy csm tegpther

Wednesday, and at the end of a
terriffic sea battle, during which
the British vcissls were lured
into waters well planted with
mine?, the Germans were forced!
to retire into their safe retreat at
Kiel, with the British suffering;
the least loss,' and still in com
mand of the seas.
First accounts declared that the
British had lost fourteen vessels,
while the Germans had lost but
three large vessels and a few
smaller Craft. Later accounts,
however, show that the Germans
lost tlghteeu vessels, including
two battleships, two drcadnaughts
for cruisers, nine torpedo boats
and a submarine, while the report
of Dritish losses remains unchang-
