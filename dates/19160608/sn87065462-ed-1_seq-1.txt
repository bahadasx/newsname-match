EH Perkins Comes Paok
Well. I rested till somebody
.accused me of bein:? doad and
zotmv dander ur. You know
yjne hour's work and two for rest
I jnd sleep. The bear crawls off
tin a hollow lop; and rests ' all
winter, the frog goes under the
Twalk and don't come out till the
second Sunday in next Msy,
when he meets his comrades
down' at the poo! and sing:
The year Jubilee has come,
Return ye ransomed sinners
..home."
And this idea of rest runs on
into nature Si realm and jumps on
the forest trees and t: -y take a
few months oft, the -giass wiib
up and dies at tl"-? f.it touch of
frost and so it oe:-t en down
the line. God mace REST thp
biggest word in tha !ijc'.jag8Sj
for when lie had worked six
days buildinjj the world tf call
ed off Saturday nifsht for a day
of rest. So if everything- arid
everybody has to have rest, you
can easdy that a literary
man must come -in for hh share.
tor the erooarngement oi- wo a
I' who h&von't much mind, ' I wiil
say they need not' losie much
time :i resting. Sometimes
there is a bkfssinin even being
iarnorant.
Well, we all hope some day to
get where "the world, the flesh
and the devil" can't bother.
' rlere you can't get three idea3
in a row and lay ail your plans
ahead but what somebody or
something gets in your way and
. you have to drive round or run
over . them. I would be for
uoving out right away, but I've
got some unfinished business
here that nobody can't attend to
but me.
Well, I wanted to see if the
world would miss me and you
see how things have got mixed
un: War- in the old countries
and now Mexico needs spanking.
President Wilson is mighty busy
steering the ship of state, so as
to miss all k the breakers. It
takes 'a strong arm, a steady
nerve and a head full of brains
' to keep from rocking the boat
and spoiling the whole thing.
When the war -began in Europe,
I was called upon to express my
opinion." " Having spent- four
years in helping run a, war 1
thought I knew all about it, so I
put my chaw of terbacco in toth
erside, rolled my eyes round
like a dying calf, gazed off into
the mysterious future, raised my
voice and proceeded to prophecy
thusly:-
."In these days cometh Eli
Perkins, being an old soldier and
f till of war wisdom, who pro
ceeded to tell all about what's
going to be the outcome of the
European, war: 'These' nations
are so well prepared for war and
so thickly settled that it will be
over in four months.' "
So you see V havn't (missed it
but 18 months so far and they
are just getting started. , ,t

a war prophet and proceeded to
reconstruct all my ideas that had
been gained by actual experience
on that subject.
I had been reading for some
' years of The, Hague Conference
where nations would meet, talk
over their differences and settle
like gentlemen, go home turn
' loose their standing armies, beat
their cannon into plow shares
and small arms into prunning
hooks, tie up the Devil for a
thousand years and proceed to
have good time. But alas for
all these dreams. The German
Emperor wanted to cross Belgum
to settle a little difficulty with
Serviai B?lum objected and
Germany tore the little Kingdom
&li;to pieces ard that made nil Eu
rope mad, and without any well
settled reason for truing to war
they dropped in one by one and
now the most gigantic war the
world has ever known is c;t.
Millions of men. and billions of
dollars are bemg spoilt and "the
cry of the widow and orphan is

Recommendations Made by De-

Measures Will Steady Whole system

.Vrcparod bj tlie United States Depart
ment of Agriculture.)
Six measures for safe farming In
the South are recommended by
the United States department of eg
rlculture In a recent circular. No m.it
ter what the price of cctton may be,
It is said, these measures will steady
the whole system and be of benefit
both to the individual and the com
munity. Tire program recommended
is as follows:
First. Produce a home garden for
every family on the -farm, the year
round, paying special attention to a
plot of Irish or sweet potatoes. Where
feasible, have a patch of sorghum or
other cane to produce sirup for the
family.
Second. Produce the corn necessary
to support aU of the people on the
farm and the live stock, with abso
lute safety. " ,
Third. Produce the necessary oats
and other small grain to supplement
the corn as food. Pay attention to
winter grazing.
Fourth. Produce hay and forage
from some forage crop, sufficient to
supply all of the Uve stock on the
farm: Use legumes such as clover,
cowpeas, velvet beans, soy beans and
alfalfa for the production of hay and
to enrich the soil with nitrogen and
humus. -
Fifth. Produce "the meat necessary
to supply.the people through Increased
attention to poultry and hogs, espe
cially. Plan to increase gradually
the number of cattle and other live
stock so as to have a sufficient num
ber to consume the waste products of
the farm and make the waste lands
productive.
Sixth. After all of these things have
been amply provided for. produce cot
ton for tire market.
".. ' Wonderful Feed for Hogs.-
Alfalfa is a wonderful feed for hogs
when fed in combinaUon with Bome
grain. Alfalfa alofce as a hog feed
does not give good results except per
haps fbr mature sows as they run on
pasture after weaning tie pigs. T
get good gains on growing pigs in ais
alfaira pasture, they should be tec
from one and a half to two pounds of
grain for every hundred-weight of, llv
bog. corn being ideal for this purpose
' 8upply of Nitrogen.' '
Nitrogen-is the most expensive to
gredient of fertilizers. . It is believed
that the cheapest means of supplying
it is by growing clover and plowing it
under green, or by feeding the stock
and returning the manure.

Malaria too Prevalent.
During the past decade, mal
aria has decreased throughout
the State. It is, however, too
prevalent now as shown by the
data in the ofiice of the State
Board of health. Malaria, or
chills and fever is not usualy a
fatal disease. It is the chief)
cause of inefficiency among our
people. There is no reason why !
malaria should not be eradicated ;
from Mississippi. It is a quest-!
ion of observing certain precau
tion and following definite treat
ment in the eradication of the
disease. Just as soon as the people
apply these measures the disease
will fast disappear.
We are jnst beginning an im -
portant season from malarial
standpoint. It is a fact that the
mnsnn'itn rlnps not onrrv the Perm
W.V-VJV.... C-J--
of malaria from one season dur-;
has been found the malaria org -
anisms cannot livein the body of
the mosquito when the tempera-.
tur is below 65 degrees. It is, j
therefore, carried from one sea-'
son to another by means of human j
host, or in the blood of man. j
The malaria that occurs this ;
season will be due to the mosqui
to becoming infected by biting
people who have the malaria
germs in their blood.
The examination of blood by
the State Board of Health field
directors in Boliver County show
that about 20 per cent of the
persons examined have the
germs in their blood. It is clear
that the mosquito this, season
will have no difficulty in finding
sources of infection.
Persons . who carry malaria
germs in- tWeis blood from mpnth
to month and from season to
season, in many instances, show
no symptons of the disease.
However, there are those who
show evidence of physical de
pletion, while others are made
sick. .The person who harbors
the malaria parasite in his blood
is termed a "malaria carrier".
These individual are potent fac
tors in the disease. It shows
plainly that the important thing
in eradicating malaria from a
community, county or state is to
cure all the people who have the
disease. It is frequently not the
fault of the physician that the
person is not cured. Un tne
contrary, it is often the case that
when people ' are told to take
quinine a certain length of time
they quit just as soon as th
chills and fever disappear, think
ing they are well, although it is
found later that the disease re
appears. There is no reason
why every person should not be
cured of malaria. Quinine . is
specific if taken in sufficient
quantities and for the right
length, of time. It is usually
necessary to take - it several
weeks before a cure is effected.
Remember that in order to erad
icate this disease," the people
shuld be cured, and you should
follow the directions of your
physician in order to protect
yourself and your community.
