gation and a big policeman bucked the
line to get ,the former speaker thru
W. Murray Crane and some of the
other, leaders began to arrive as the
hour moved to 11 o'clock. Eleven
o'clock passed without a /sign of the
convention coming to order.
At 11:20 the band broke into "The
Star Spangled Banner," the crowd rose
and there was scattered handclapping.
It was just 11.22 when Chairman
Harding brought down the gavel.
Chairman Harding asked the con
vention to rise while Monsignor George
G. Kelley read a prayer. The conven
tion stood in silence as he read the in
vocation.
Reports Heard.
The band began "Rock of Ages," but
when thru the first bar the leader saw
he was out of order and stopped.
Chairman Harding then called for the
report of the committee on- creden
tials.
Chairman Smoot, of the committee,
began reading the report, listening to
the decisions In contested, pases. It
excluded two delegates from the Dis
trict of Columbia and admitted two
each from Alaska and Hawaii. The
feport was adopted.
William H. Hahn, of Ohio, made the
report of the committee on, permanent
organization, recommending the tem
porary organization, be made perma
nent. Former Representative Bennet,
of New York, took the. gavel, put the
question and it was carried. Mr. Ben
net then presented Mr. Harding as
permanent chairman. Then followed
the longest demonstration so far.
finally the crowd quieted and Mr.
Harding thanked the convention.
The report of the rules committee
was next but it was not ready and at
the request of the chairman the band
started up again,
Rules Adopted.
The chairman stopped the music to
recog-nize" Senator Smoot again with a
supplemental report of the credentials
committee. It proposed to 'give six
votes to the delegates of the Philip
pines, Hawaii and Porto Rico. That
made 909 votes in the convention.
Finally the report of the miles com
mittee was reacfy, and .Mr. WArren of
Michigan presented it. It was a unani
mous report and has been published.
Briefly the rules of the convention
are those of the house of representa
tives with certain modifications to
adapt them to the needs of so different
a_body.

Depew ,Speaks. '.T
The report of the resolutions com
mittee was the next order of business
but the chairman announced that with
arbitrary authority which goes with
the gavel he. would.'appoint Secretary
Stimson and Speaker Sweet, of New

Eighty-two years'' old," the famous
New Yorker faced the convention amid
cheers. Bis voice, still full and round,
carried better than those of younger
men who had preceded- him.
Mr. Depew told "the ^convention it
was the sixty-first anniversary of his
preaching republicanism.
"Today we have a world crisis In
which even- Christianity is doubted,"
he said. "We are entering upon this
canvass either with .an assertion of
Americanism that will keep us out of
it or a mollicoddle policy, that will
put us into it"
Root's Name 'Cheered..
The convention applauded Mr. De
fcew's reference to the victories of re
publican diplomacy.
The mention of Elihu Root brought
cheers. It was the first reference to a
candidate. The general tone of Mr. De
pew's speech was for'national defense.
When he paused the crowd cried "Go
"Whek I turn to a pacificist." he con
tinued, "I turn to !a leading exponent,
Mr. Bryan, who is here jn the. hall."
The former secretary Vas In the press

Mr. Depew spoke thirty minutes. His
parting shot was that It the convention

Chairman Harding^ introduced Mr.
Cannon as "grand Old- Uncle Joe."

Auditorium, Chicago, June 8.—Ring
\n& declarations of Americanism and
for preparedness, military, spiritual,
economical and industrial, are key
notes of the progressive party platform
completed today.
The platform makers-hoped to pre
sent the platform to the convention to
day or by tomorrow at. the latest.
The platform declares for the "uphold—j-jyeat
ing of American rights on land and
sea, and maintenance of the integrity
of international law.
Regarding Mexico the platform as
serts "that every resource or the_ gov
ernment should be forthwith used to
end these conditions.."
The text of the platrorm follows:
"This is the year of decision for the
nation's future. As we now decide so
wo shall go forward in righteousness
and power, or backward in degredatlon
and weakness.
"Of necessity we deal how with the
foundations of our national life. We

rrght and wrong, of extreme national
peril. Our present choice of paths will
ii» "tTTeHn^blc.-"
The-tradltlon of irfoht--
tlon has been ended. The United States
is now part of a yorld system of civ
ilization.
Americanism Paramount Issue.
"We stand or fall as we prepare now
to take our part In peace or war and
hold our own therein.-.*
"As members of au International
community we are subject to certain
basic duties
To secure the rights and equal treat
ment of our citizens, native or natural
ized, on land or sea, without regard to
-race, creed or nativity
To guard the honor and uphold the
just influence of our nation
"To maintain the integrity of inter
national law.
Peace Thru Preparedness.
"These are the corner stones of civ
ilization. We. must be strong to de
fend them. The present war shows that
it is the duty of civilization to create
a durable peace. The peace which we
desire for our country is not the peace
of submission or cowardice, but the
peace of justice. War p.nd its. evils will
not be done away with offering Jus
tice to ourselves or others or by pledg
ing ourselves to drastic action for in
ternational right If we do not prepare
the forces which would sustain such
action. We can perform our rightful
part in promoting international peace
only by a willingness to defend our
own rights and the rights of other na
tions. There are higher things that we
must kfeep, as Washington and Lincoln
kept them for us. Falling to deal firm
ly with the Mexican disorders- has
brought about a condition worse than
warfare. Every resource of government
s&ould be forthwtlh used to end those
conditions.
For Greater Military Force.
"We must be ready in spirit, arms
and industry." Preparation in arms re
quires:
"A navy restored at least to second
rank in efficiency.. ».
"A regular army of 250,000 men, fully
armed "hnd trained.
"A system of miliary training ade
quate Xo organize with promptness, be
hind that first line of the army and
navy, a citizen soldiery, supplied, armed
and controlled by the national govern
ment.
"In our democracy every male citizen
is charged with the duty of defending
his country. This duty Is not new.. Un
der modern conditions it can not be
performed wtlhout adequate training.
"To make possible social justice, to
maintain our position in peace and
war, we must insure business and in
dustrial prosperity. This can be done:
'IBy a regulation of industry aimed
at promoting Its growth and pros
perity and a just distribution of its re

"By a conservation atyl development
of our national resources.
"By the re-establishment of a mer

Protective Tariff Urged.
"The protective system is essential
in our prosperity. New pressures will
be thrown upon our industries after
the war by the highly mobilized pro
duction of Europe. At all times condi
tions of competition must be equalized
between our own and foreign coun
tries. We Q.an only get the protection
we need thru the use of exact and
complete knowledge, unaffected by
prejudice or politics.
"The industrial issues are chiefly
national! TKte present and certain fut
ure make it imperative that the reg
ulation and promotion of Industry and,
especially, of transportation and for
eign'trade, be national, not local. Only
federal power can work Justice to cap

"Beneath the structure of military
and economic strength must be a uni
fied spirit of this cosmopolitan people,
a deep loyalty and undivided allegi
ance.
Pave Way to Compromise.
"We have set forth in this platform,
plain essentials to national existence.
Most men agree with them. Any man
may propose them. The urgent need Is
their performance. We have had
ample experience with the ijromlser:
with words and the bitter taste of
words retracted. We must choose a
man who not alone by words but by
past deeds gives guarantee that he can
and will make these things good.
"We will meet and work with any
party who sees the nation's need and
puts forward a leader fit to meet It. We
will accept not less in p!ar or man and
we charge on any who place partisan
politics above country, the responsibil
ity for a nation's future, sacrificed to
self interest and spoils"
Robbins Permanent Chairman.
By a vote of 25 to 11, Raymond Rob
bins was chosen over Hiram Johnson
as permanent chairman of the con
vention by the committee on perma
organization. No ballots were
cast for any other officials.
Some of the leaders, including Mur
dock, were seriously coasidering im
mediate nomination today of Colonel
Roosevelt. Murdock was quoted as
sayirig:
"It might too late tomorrow."

London, June S.—An Exchange Tele

that place have been ordered to hold
themselves in readiness to proceed to
Peking. The dispatch also says the
French authorities already have dis
patched a strong detachment of native

Chicago. June 8.—A proposed plank
in the republican platform declaring
for woman'3 suffrage was rejected in
the sub-committee by a vote of 5 to
4. Those favoring the plank were
Senators oin'n, Sutherland and Fall,
and Representative Gladden, of Illinois.
Those voting against it were Senators
Wadsworth and Lodge, Charles Hop
kins Clarke, of Hartford, Conn., former
Representative Howland, of Ohio, and
Senator Oliver, of Pennsylvania.
If the republican convention should
concur in the attitude of the sub
committee the rejection, in the opin
ion of delegates, would form a direct
answer to the threat .of the new
woman's party to 'swing the woman
vot^ of the twelve states against the
republicans.
The sam* threat however, applies
to any other party and rejection of the
plank by the democrats would nullify
the suffrage attack as between the two
old parties. The progressives all along
have stood for equal suffrage.
Strong Plank on Mexico.
The sub-committee adopted a plank
respecting relations with Mexico

dent's policy. Reject'*'" of the plank

plank being carried before the con

Concerning Mexico t^e resolutions
refer to the "deplorable" conditions
which exist there as a result of Wash
ington's policy and speaks of the
shame inflicted upon the United
States. It pledges the republican party
to provide for the protection of the
citizens in and near the border of the
country and in Mexico.
Strong For Preparedness.
The preparedness plank will declare
both for military and industrial pre
paredness. Provisions relative to the
increase in the strength of the army
and navy—able to meet any possible
foe—satisfactory to the Navy League
and similar organizations, have been
incorporated.
The platform contains a strong
declaration for the adoption of a sys
tem of universal military training.
The restoration of a protective tariff
is declared essential to the prosperity
of the nation. It is declared that un
less a protective tariff is enacted the
country will suffer greatly at the close
of the war.
Monroe Doctrine Reaffirmed.
The platform reaffirms the Monroe
doctrine.
"We declare in favor of national
control of transportation agencies thru
the interstate commerce commission
by a constitutional amendment it
necessary." says the platform.
The platform declares for restric
tion of Immigration by a literacy test
as advocated by organized labor.
In order to meet the views of pro
gressives some of the social justice
planks of the 1912 bull moose plat
form are incorporated. Among them
is a provision favoring the enactment
of a child labor law.

MOOSERS ROOSEVELT MAD.
Cheer Roosevelt's Name For One Hour
and Thirty-Five Minutes.
Chicago, June J.—The mention of
the Tiame or Theodore Roosevelt at the
progressive national convention in the
Auditorium Theater .yesterday liber
ated a flood of enthusiasm which
washed away all previous convention
recdrds.
"The foremost private citizen of the
world. Theodore Roosevelt" said Tem
porary Chairman Raymond Robins as
he launched his keynote oration, and a
deafening din set up which almost
wrecked the convention.
Banners were seized by. the exu
berant progressives. Delegations began
to move about the theater. Steadily
the roar Increased. Songs, cheers,
state slogans, college yells wer«
blended In mad confusion.
"We Want Teddy."
Old men and fat men jumped over
benches. Self-possessed leaders climbed*
from tho atage to the orchestra pit
Occasionally the band burst in. But
above all the noise and tumult arose
the unceasing, insistent cry: "We wane
Teddy, we want Teddy."
George "\V. Perkli^s. the dlgnitied
executive committee chairman, clam
bered to the top of a table and begad''
gyrating like a cheer leader at a foot-'f
ball game. Chairman Robins kept hta^
position helplessly while Victor Mur
dock banged with Kansas vigor for a
quiet and order which the assembly'
was in no mood to grant.
Parade of Standards,
For one hour and thirty-five min
utes the outbreak lasted. A stalwart
westerner in the rear of the ha"
grabbed a standard bearing the slo
gan. "Texas Wants Teddy." The whole
Texas delegation followed. A Petm
sylvanian picked up a tall blue enslgt
and rushifcd to the stage.
