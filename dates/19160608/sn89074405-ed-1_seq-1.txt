IS FOR UNION TO
SAFEGUARD NATION
Asks Factions to Forget
Differences and Join for
Honor of Country.
Oyster Bay, June 8.—Theodore
Roosevelt will come to Chicago if the
"republican .convention desires me to
address it." This he announced today
in reply to aii Invitation from Senator
Jackson of Maryland, asking him to
come to Chicago.
Roosevelt,' fri answer to the invita
tion to oome to Chicago, said he
hoped both the republicans and pro
gressives would" nominate a man who,
if elected, would "place this nation
•«rtiere it belongs by -making: it true
to itself and, therefore, true to man
kind." President Wilson, the colonel
said, "rendered to this people the
most evil service that can be ren
dered to a great democracy."
Roosevelt declared "the differences
dividing not merely republicans and
progressives, but good Americans of
all shades- and political belief sink
into nothing when compared with the
issues demanding decision and the
issues, of united Americanism and
national preparedness."
After saying he would come to Chi
cago if the republican convention de
sires him to address it, the colonel
said:
"Can we not, forgetting past dif
ferences, now Join for the safety and
honor of our country, to enforce a
policy of genuine Americanism and
genuine preparedness?
"In the face of the awful world
cataclysm this nation has stood supine
and helpless. No excuse now made
by those responsible for this inaction
is entitled to. serious consideration-"
Wilson Criticised.
In reference-tq'the. present admin
istration,' Roosevelt!
said:
"President Mniiion' however. ia
amiable apd hi^ intentions are good,
but he has rentder^d this people the
mo'st evil service, that can be rendered
to a great democracy by its chosen
leader. He haa dulled the nation's
conscience and relaxed the spring of
lofty national motive'by teaching our
people to accept'high ppunding words
as the offset and atonement for a
shabby deed and to use words which
mean nothing In order to draw all
meaning from those which have a
meaning. It will be no "easy task to
arouse the austere: self respect which
haa been lulled to slumber- by these
means. To this task-we should bend
our united energies In the aplrtt of
Washington and .Lincoln, the aplrit of
genuine democratic leadership, the
aplrit which sets" the itandard to
which the nation, ought to rlae. and
than .. .with confident hope appeal to
the 8qu1 of the people ao that they
may In fact aupport the standard thus
raJaad."

WfU AS OTHERS, DESIRE THIRD
PARTY ONLY HAVEHUCH SWIENGTH
Leaders of Both Factions Now Admit That There is
Slight Prospect of Re-union—Temporary
Organization Made Permanent.
Chicago. June 8-—The Republican and Progressive national con
ventions entered the second day of active work today, the former re.
convening at. 11 o'clock at the Coliseum and the latter at 2 o'clock
at the Auditorium, while the fight for the supremacy that will bring
harmony was waged without cessation by some of the biggest indi
vidual figures in present day American politics.
Struggling against the flight of hours, a complexity of motive and
an Impulse that fairly baffled them, seasoned political strategists and
leaders conferred constantly in an endeavor to find the answer, if pos
sible. before the answer was precipitated upon them by the delegates on
the floors of the two conventions.
Kach time a combination seemed to have lieen achieved or a
defiinte result obtained early today, well laid plans would le swept
aside by some unexpected twist or counter-attack, while the situation
again was to be talked from another angle.
But one certain and dear-cut result pushed its way up through
the-mass of reports and rumors. That was the fact that Justice
Hughes became stronger hourly.
Late developments Indicated clearly that neither convention
would make a nomination before Friday, or possibly later.
Committees of both conventions were working most of the night
and this morning, endeavoring to clean up their duties. The resolu
tions sub-committee of the Republicans finished deliberations today,
having drafted a platform. Other committees pressed forward «"lth
their programs, tiring to be ready with report* when the conventions
reconvened.
PLATFORM COMMITTRE WORKS IX SECRECY.
The strictest secrecy surrounded the work of the republican sub
committee. It having adopted a resolution not to divulge anything In
connection wHh the platform until submitted to the full committee. It
was learned, however, that the committee found little trouble in draft
»»g a declaration jf princiifl^ tije dfctief work hgtog In agreeing qn
the phza*e61cgy.
generally believed that tills platform will eafU mowt of the
principles adopted four years ago. The new features will Include a
laratlon on Americanism. The International situation will be touched
upon. The Mexican policy and the present administration will be criti
cized. it is said.
Amid a confusion of claims and counter-claims today, discussions
of possible peace and the fusion of the two parties assumed a more
concrete trend, rumors becoming persistent that Roosevelt might corns
to Chicago and appear before both conventions in the role of pacifier.
MANY AGAINST ANY ALIGNMENT.
Republican leaders discussed the proposal to Invite Roosevelt to
Chicago, deciding, it is said, if Roosevelt prepared to declare himself
out of the contest for nomination, to enter into an agreement for the
selection of a republican candidate, if the invitation will be forthcom
ing.
From Progressive quarters came reports of the center western pro
gressive delegations solidly set against fusion. It Is reported that North
Dakota and other progressive state delegations desired a third party
above all else and would do everything possible to prevent the progres
sive convention from entering a peace pact.
These stated the delegation. It is reported, is sufficient in numbers
to block every effort of George W. Perkins and other progressive lead
ers to enter into an agreement with the republicans. If this situation
is true, it means in all probability that the progressive convention will
go on and complete its work regardless of what the leaders may sug
gest or order, and that Colonel-Roosevelt will receive the nomination
whether he wants it or not. Such conditions, serving in part to increase
the expectancy of Roosevelt's coming to Chicago, as it is stated by
men closely in touch with the developments, only Roosevelt's arrival on
the ground would head off the rank and file of the progressive dele
gates in the mood they exhibited yesterday and today.
As the day wore on it became more and more apparent that two
tickets will be in the field.
Victor Murdock, chairman or the progressive national committee,
summed up the whole situation, when he said:
"Well, we left the door open, but the republicans don't seem to be
coming in."
Court Rules That all His
Letters Must be Turned
Over to Defense.
REPUBLICAN LEADERS ALSO DOUBTFUL.
Republican leaders, too, discounted success of the peace talk, say
ing that action bad been delayed so long that the majority of the re
publican delegates already had decided without regard for a third par
ty to nominate Hughes.
The belief prevailed that the republican nomination will be made
tomorrow, but it is not expected that the convention will adjourn until
the progressives act.
Delegates believe the progntssi ves will nominate Saturday, or be
fore. Roosevelt and Johnson, the standard bearers four years ago.
When the republican convention got down to business. Senator
Smoot presented the report of the credentials committee, which was
adopted. The report of the. permanent organization committee, recom
mending that the temporary organization be made permanent,
adopted. Permanent Chairman Harding receiving an ovation.
One current rumor was that Roosevelt telegraphed to
rooms at a local hotel.
