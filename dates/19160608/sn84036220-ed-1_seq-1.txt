CHICAGO, June 7.—The lirngrpsKivp
national convention opened in the
Auditorium today with a record-break
ing demonstration for Colonel Roose
velt.
For one hour and thirty-three min
utes the delegates and spectators
roared, shouted, cheered and uppluud
ed. They sang the progressive battle
hymns, paraded the aisles and over the
stage and howled down all uttempts
;o check them. The (iomonstrution
i xeeeded the previous record for such
affairs of one hour and twenty-nine;
minutes, established in the democratic I
convention in Denver in 1908, in be |
half of William J. Bryan, which had
exceeded by lour minutes the record
made that same year in the republican |
lonventlon in Chicago, when Colonel i
Roosevelt s supporters sought his noin- i
illation ove*- William II. Taft. i
Raymond Robins, temporary chair
man of the convention, had spoken
just three sentences of Ills keynote '
speeeli when lie mentioned Colonel
ltoosevelt's nume. A wave of enthu-!
slasm that amounted to nothing less ,
than a paroxysm resulted. "The fore-1
most citizen of the world," was the j
characterization used in connection i
with his mention of the colonel's!
name. The response was instantune- 1
cus. "We want Teddy!" roared the
delegates and the demonstration was I
en. With umbrellas raised they be-!
gan marching about the hall. They 1
flowed upon the stuge and wrung Vic
tor Murdock's hand as they filed by j
until the stalwart Kansan's collar was 1
wilted. Hamilton Fish Jr. and another j
man seized a delegate hearing an
American flag and carried him around
the hall on their shoulders. Banners
were torn from their places and the!
stanchions were lifted from the floor!
as the shouting host trumped around. I
,„r!'? lr , man I * ob ' n8 j made several at
tempts to quell the demonstration, but I
11 >, ra ?• Ravel gave j
it up. The band chimed in with the!
progressive battle hymns and soon the
surging crowd was tramping the aisles
to the struins of "Onward, Christian
Soldiers." Despite the handicap of the
steps leading up into the balcony, the
demonstration spread there and soon
the spectators in the balconies joined
in. Banners were snatched from their
hangings and waved, hearing the in
cription:
'Teddy and safety first."
"If Teddy Was President, Where
Would Villa Be?"
"The People Want T. R„ a Regular
American."
"Why Take Chances? We Know
What Roosevelt Can Do."
"We Want Teddy," and other pro
gressive slogans.
Then the band switched to "March
ing Through Georgia," and a medley
ot popular airs and the aisles became
so blocked that no one moved for sev
________...___
c.-al minutes. While the marchers stood
still In the jam they kept up the dln
und alter it had been going on one
hour, George W. Perkins left the stage
and decided to go to his hotel and wait
tor it to subside. The Michigan dele
gallon tramped in from'the rain out-j
side and their leaders demanded an
outdoor demonstration.
"Teddy is not afraid of the rain,"
they shouted. "Get out and march."
And in a body they filed from the hall
into the deluge outside, chanting "Ted
dy, You're a Bear." Some of the dele
gates returned in their soggy garments
with banners and Hags bedraggled and
dripping hut their '.mthnsiasm was not
dampened, for they joined the march
ing, roaring throng again.
The leaders, impressed by what
they realized might have beeu the dif
ficulty of holding the convention from
proceeding immediately to nomina
tions. then discussed means to quiet
the uproar. "Let them yell," conn
selleil one of the leaders. "Now that
they have shouted it will he easier to
delay action on a nomination."
A proposal to use the uniformed po
lice to quell the demonstration wus
discussed among the leaders, hut it
was decided that the experiment was
too dangerous. By this time some of
the- enthusiasts who had been waving
bandanas, became dissatisiled with
their efforts, so they took off their
coats and waved them about their
heads. One delegate put a black
slouch hat with a bandana around tho
rim on a tall pole and paraded around.
"Whoop-ee!" he roared. "She's in the
ring-'' The delegates from the state
of Washington wrapped an American
flag about one of their women mem
bers and carried her up and down the
aisles.
Other western women took 'lie cue
and for the next few minutes there
was a continuous flag demonstration
Meanwhile scouts came In witii the
report that the repu*ilican convention

ly acknowledged to be an organ
izer of the greatest ability. But
there seems to be no disposition
to exaggerate the importance of
his death or to base particular
hopes thereon. The Lokal An

What the Bull Moosers Were Doing
in the Auditorium Than It Was in
the Arrival of Big Leaders.
CHICAGO, June 7.- The republican
convention assembled in the Coliseum
today, heard a keynote speech de
livered by Senator Warren G. Harding
ol' Ohio, perfected an organization and
adjourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow
)morning. it all took just two hours
j und in its luck of demonstration or
outbursts of any kind and its strict at
tention to the business in hand, was
reminiscent of the Philadelphia con
vention of 1901) that nominated Mc
Kinley and Roosevelt.
For one hour und twenty minutes
Senator Harding, the temporary chair
man, delivered a carefully prepared
speech, punctuated in the telling
points with brief periods of handclap
ping amt applause, but at no time did
a demonstration occupy more Ilian a
half minute by the watch.
The convention was 25 minutes be
hind the hour arranged for its assem
bly, but when Chairman Hilles of the
republican national committee brought
down his gavel at 11:25 o'clock, events
moved quietly and with precision until
adjournment at 1:25.
Those of the old-time leaders present
who used to march down the aisles
to their seats to the tune of an up
rour, walked in today almost unrecog

probably because a majority of the
delegates did not even know them by
sight. Chuuncey Depew was surround
ed by a small admiring group, Sena-!
tor Penrose got a reception from his
own delegation, Governor Whitman
was recognized by some, hut on the
whole the convention was more in
(crested in wondering what was going
on in the Auditorium than it was in
the arrival of the men who hitherto
have derided what the convention
should do with itself.
Th
11 o'clock, but there was no semblance
of order at that time and no one made
any pretense of securing it. The dele
gates stood about the door and talked,
tile spectators overflowed into the

hour lor assembling was set for
spaces reserved for the delegates and
hundreds of seats on the floor and in
said lie, "th
the galleries were empty. Finally
Chairman Hilles gave signs of culling
Hie convention to order and the uni
formed police began moving about urg
ing the delegates into their places.
Finally, at 12:28 o'clock, Chairman
Hilles brought down the gavel with
three resounding whacks and quiet set
tled down over the big hall.
"The hour of 11 o'clock having ar
ived and a quorum being present,
convention will he in
order. Paraphrasing a remark made
,
I. resident McKinley, this
is a year whatever may have been
true of past yours- when politics is
patriotism and patriotism is politics.
Therefore, the audience will please
rise and sing two verses of 'America.' "
The hand launched into the air and.

gulleries joined in a mighty chorus
that swept through the big Coliseum.
There was a moment of confusion at
the end or the singing as the delegates
found their seats again, and then tho
Rev. John Timothy Stone of Chicago
read a prayer. The big audience re
mained seated at his request.
Secretary Reynolds then read the
call for the convention, which was
published last December. It was only
a formality. None of the delegates
wanted to hear it, so they talked and
moved about while Mr. Reynolds kept
on. That over. Chairman Hilles pre
