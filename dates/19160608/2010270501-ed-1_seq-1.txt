SLOGAN OF "AMKMCA FIRST."
Preldcnt Wilson's Suiierb Ilecord
Offers HoIm for Incomparable
Keynote Speech.
In direct contrast to tho expected
turbulent Republican gathering In
Chicago, the Democratic national
eonventton In St. Louis, which will
eonveno Wcdneolay, Juno 14, prom
ises to bo a great political lovcfeast,
devoid of discenslon and acrimonious
discussion.
The 1,092 delegates to the St.
Louis convention and cn equal num
ber of tlternates, repreoenting every
State In the Union and the insular
possessions across the Bea, will fore
gather to rolco the unanimous desire
of Democrats everywhere that Wood
row Wilson shall lead the party In a
second presidential campaign.
Harmony of choice and unity of
action will mark the proceedings of
the convention so far as President
Wilson Is concerned ,and his nomina
tion for another four years in the
White House will bo a mere formal
ity. The only possible contest will be
ver the vice presidency.
John W. Wescott, Attorney Gen
eral of New Jersey, whose eloquence
aptivated the Baltimore convention
la 1912 when he then presented the
same of Woodrow Wilson, will per
form the same function at St. Louis.
Bvery State delegation will Bend Its
prize orator to the platform to echo
the tributes Mr. Wescott is expected
to pay to New Jersey's favorite son.
The keynote address of the con
vention will be delivered by former
Governor Martin Glynn of New York,
who probably will be chosen by the
National Committee for temporary
chairman of the convention. Accord
ing to custom, Gov. Glynn will render
an account of the Democratic stew
ardship of national affairs and will
forecast the Issues upon which the
administration will meet the opposi
tion In the fall campaign.
Not in the history of the existing
political parties has any "keynoter"
had greater reason to boast of a
party's accomplishments, and Gov.
Glynn, Judging by his ringing Ad
dress at the New York State conten
tion, over which he presided, will
make the most of his opportunity.
It has not been definitely settled
who will be honored with the per
manent chairmanship of the St. Louis
gathering. The choice, of course, will
ae made by the committee on per
manent organization, but It has been
hinted that Speaker Champ Clark
Clark will be Invited to wield the
gavel.
The platform to be adopted at St.
Louis promises to teem with the
spirt of "America first." President
Wilson's Incomparable State papers
international questions and the con
structive record of the Democratic
Congress make the writing of the
platform a comparatively easy task.
Space does not permit the enumera
tion, but It may generally be said
mat tne prosperity now being en
Joyed throughout the country may In
a large measure be attributed to leg
Islation passed since the advent of
Woodrow Wilson in the White
House.
St. Louis, famed for Its hospitality,
Is making preparations to entertain
thousands of visitors during conven
tion week. Many amusement fea
tures have been planned. The de
mand for tickets to the convention
far exceeds the capacity of the big
couseum wnere the convention will
be held.
MAGNESIAJFOR STREETS
One Box Butte County Ranchman
Uses the Material la Place of
Cement for Building
Tanks.
That Aliance clan have hard sur
faced streets at a slight expense is
proven by the fact that large beds of
magntsia lie not far from town and
that this material Is used successfully
in surfacing roads at different places
in tho county.
Secretary Guthrie of the commer
cial club has a sample of magnesia In
his office, as hard as a rock. One Box
Butte county ranchman has used this
magnesia for years in building his
taks. using it in place of cement, and
claims that it is just as satisfactory.

VANDAL DAMAGES CARS
Electric Wiring on about Twenty
Autos Cut Saturday Night by
I'nknowii Vandal
While the owners were enjoying
themselves Saturday night at the
dance at the Link Davis farm, three
miles north of Alliance, some vandal
cut the wiring on nearly all of twen
ty automobiles which were parked
there.
When the dance broke up at 2
o'clock Sunday morning the owners
of the cars discovered the damage
and telephoned Into Alliance for
Charley Tash, local auto expert, who
made a quick trip to the farm and
repaired the damage to the cars so
that they could navigate. Charley
sent a driver in his car back to town
to get some wire, and the driver
mipsed a culvert and went Into a
ditch, damaging this car.
A certain party, believed to be
guilty of the damage, is under sus
picion and may be placed under ar
rest when more evidence is unearth-

Ice Cream Supper
Saturday
The Herald's Dandelion Contest closed at six o'clock last Friday
evening, with a total of 4,63916 pounds of dandelions brought to
The Herald office in three weeks by the boys and girls of Alliance.
The winners for last Friday night were:
Esther Bacon, girl's prise of a dress, given by The Fashion
Shop, with a total of 387 pounds for the week.
Verne Gribble, boy's prize of a baseball mitt, given by the
Brennan Drug Store .with a total of 170 pounds for
the week.
Mr. A. J. Macey, who is the original promoter of the dandelion
contest in Alliance, and who acted as chief judge at the end of each
week, was assisted last week by D. E. Watson and Frank Palmer.
Mr. Macey was congratulated on tbe successful outcome of the con
test. In order to ascertain the approximate number of dandelion
gathered by the boys and girls during the content, seventy-five plants
were weighed, giving a total of two and one-half pounds, with an av
erage of six separate dandelion stalks to the plant. The total fig
ures showed 139,185 dandelion plants gathered during the contest,
with a total of 834.870 stalks. This materially reduced the dande
lion population of Alliance, and a weight greater than Vaugban's
Mogul Tractor was turned In.

part In the contest, are Invited, will be jiven at The Herald office at
five o'clock Saturday afternoon. .June 10th. Mr. Mary will preside
at the supper and the boys and girls are promised all they can eat.
There will be music and a good time for everybody. Every boy and
girl who registered during the contest, no matter whether they won
a prize or not, is invited to come.
BABY LIONS BORN
Sappho, Forest Bred African Lioness,
Cave Birth to Three Baby Lions
Monday Morning
Sappho, the forest-bred African
HonesB, with the C. A. Wortham
shows, exhibiting in Alliance this
week, on Monday morning at 3
o'clock gave birth to- three baby li
ons. The keeper of the lioness
states that this is the third time In
the history of lions In captivity that
trlpletts have been born to a lioness.
In honor of Alliance and the news
papers of the town, the show man
agement has christened the baby li
ons with very appropriate names:
"Alliance." "Herald." "Times." Ap
propriate ceremonies were held at
the animal show Wednesday and the
babies were christened in due form.
This newspaper fondly hopes that
"Herald" will be true to his name
sake and lead an upright life and not
fight with "Times." In case "Her
ald" and "Times" should take It Into
their heads to whip "Alliance" they
would undoubtedly raise the dickens
with her.
