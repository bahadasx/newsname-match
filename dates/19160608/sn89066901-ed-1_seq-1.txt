CYCLONE HITS HOUSE
Alex Kelley's Residence De
stroyed Monday After
noonOther Damage .
The vicinity north of Mansfield
was visited by a cyclone Monday
afternoon, which completely de
molished the residence of Alex
Kelley, 5 miles north of town.
The building was a story and a
half box house and, with the ex
ceptionof the floor, it is said
there is not a whole piece of tim
ber left of the building. The cy
clone struck the house at about
3 o'clock. Fortunately, no one
was at home at the time. The
contents of the house were scat
tered to the four winds, the
clothing of the members of the
household being on trees all over
the place. The furniture was
demolished and widely scattered
All of it has not been located yet
The floor was carried over a high
timber and deposited in a wheat
field about 300 yards from where
the house stood. -

Mr. Mai. Qulnn thinks Gardner is
being wronged by tbe circulation of
a story appearing in tbe press of the
state to tbe effect that tbe guber
natorial candidate Is independent in
politics. The published statement was
copied from a book of St. Louis pub
lication and of course found wide pub
lication. Mr. Quinn calls attention
to a contributed letter in yesterday's
Republic from John I. Martin, in which
the writer Alls a wide half column

Governor Spoke in
Mansfield Tuesday
Hon. James A. Houchin of Jef
ferson City, Democratic candi
date for governor of Missouri,
delivered an address hsre Tues-
JAMES A. HOUCHIN,
day afternoon. On account of
the inclemency of the weather,
the audience was not as large as
it otherwise would have been.
Mr. Houchin is a successful
business man and is asking for
the . nomination on a business

ilies off the pay roll, - merit sys
tem for ' state institutions, a
workingman's compensation act,
improved rural conditions,'; laws
that would encourage the build-
log; of more raikaadiHJthe: state,
a' farmers', selling organization
through tbe state . board of agri
culture, etc. His plea is for effic
iency in the administration of
the affairs of the gubernatorial
office, and against' rotation in
office.
Mr. Houchin made a favorable
impression. upon our people, who
will be pleased to have him pay
our city another visit in the near

BIG MAXWELL ORDER
Low Fuel Consumption Big
Factor in Order for
27 Automobiles
The Maxwell Motor Company
closed a contract last week with
the municipal government of
Kansas City for twenty-seven
new motor cars. The order was
placed 1 by William C. Weaver,
purchasing agent for Kansas
City, after he had made an inves
tigation extending over a oVkl of
cars of various makes. He found
the Maxwell best adapted to the
needs of the exacting municipal
service, because of its durability
its dependsdility and its great
economy in operatton.
Another factor that entered in
to the closing of the contract was
the prompt delivery guaranteed
by the Maxwell Company. A
promise was made that the cars
would all be turned over in three
days and this promise was ful
filled to the letter.
In the consignment are twen
ty-one runabouts, and a touring
car, tbe remainder being chassis
for special commercial bodies. . ,
The growing popularity of the
Maxwell chassis in the commer
cial field was another element
that entered into the transaction".
These chassis are delivered all
ready for the tops to be fitted on
There is no extra wiring or ad
justing to be done. The tops
may; be made according to the
spefications and requirements of
the owner. Many merchants are
finding this a most convenient
method of purchasing cars for
delivery purposes.
Last year, Kansas City used a
number of motor cars of a make
other than Maxwell in its muni
cipal 'service. For several months
JSlr-Waver, the city's purchas- '
ing" agent", has been "keeping a "
close tab on gasoline consumption
add he knows a good deal of what
the Maxwell, can accomplish a
long this very important line. Ho
wisely. concluded that the use of
Maxwell cars for the city service
would cut down the municipal
gasoline bill to an appreciable de
gree. Is Your Name Here?
