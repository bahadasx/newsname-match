COLONEL HAS BECOME
AS SILENT AS HUGHES
TMIK captnln of n New Ent;liintl whalitift vessel once instructed his
mate: "I want nothing out of you but silence, nnd mitrhty little
of that."
That is the anecdote which Col. Roosevelt feinted in the study of
his home Inst night when pressed with questions FtrK(?csted by tho
ChicaRo conventions. Even Charles E. Hufihes is not more silent.
Despite the insistent reports from Chicago that Col. Kooscvelt is
about to start for thnt city, that the fituation there demands his pres
ence on the battleground, and thnt the Progressives havo importuned
him to take the next train from Oyster Hay, tho Colonel was still at
Sagamore Hill late last evening and said that he expected to remain
there. All the some, it is known that if the Colonel did change his
mind he would be able to leave for Chicago at a moment's notice, as
no arrangements to facilitate. such a trip have been overlooked.
The burden of Col. Roosevelt's answers to all queries, put to him
was that he had no comment to make. This was the reply to the
report that Senator Hoies Penrose of Pennsylvania had talked with
him over the telephone at 1 o'clock yesterday morning. The Colonel
made no explicit denial of such a conference over the wire. He pre
ferred to say: "N'o comment to make." and he pointed out that if he
began denying one report he would at once be forced to deny a
thousand.
"No comment to make" also win the Colonel's tcply to tho report
that Senator Borah of Idaho, who is for Hughes, had talked with him
and found the conversation entirely to his satisfaction. Anil to all
other reports Col. Roosevelt made the same response.
Tho Colonel's conversations with Chicago are being watched over
by ngents of the telephone company, who are posted along the line of
the direct wire to see that there arc no leaks.

and iidjourn.-d until U o'clock to-morrow
morning.
ClilCAtiO, June 7. William P. Jackson, Republican National Com
mittecninu for Maryland, sent the following telegram to Col. Roosevelt
j to-night:
1 THEODORE ROOSEVELT, Oyiler Bay, N. Y.:
The national interetti demand the complete reunion of the
Republican party, which unhappily divided in 1912. I believe that
thi can be accomplished by a more perfect understanding between
you and the Republican convention now assembled. I therefore most
earnestly urge you lo come to Chicago immediately to address this
I convention and to make common cause in our deliberations. If you
will indicate your willingness and adopt this course, I will use my
utmost endeavors to secure for you the privileges of the convention
floor. WILLIAM P. JACKSON,
Republican National Committeeman, Maryland.
It is known that in this action Mr. Jackson had the approval of som
of the Republican leaders.
I At 11 o'clock last night Col Itooi-evelr at tiser Itav. .,id ne had not
IC' lived any telegram from Republicans asking him to come lo Chicago.
It was announced here definitely after the Jackson message had
been sent to Col. Roosevelt that he would not accept tho invitation; that
he would send n reply to it, however. It is expected that Col. Roosevelt
will take thnt opportunity to deliver an importnnt message to the Rcpub-
C beers tor Johnson.
