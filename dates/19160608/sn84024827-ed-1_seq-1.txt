For one hour and twen

l.v prepared speech, punc-
tuated in the telling points Jr
with brief periods of
hand clapping and p-.
plause but at rO time did (
a demonstration occupy
more-than a half minute
by the watch.
The convention was '
twenty five minutes be

the Republican national

with precision until ad
journment at 1:25. Those
of the old time leaders A
present who used to
march town tne aisles 10
their seats to the tune of
an uproar, walked in to
day almost unrecocnized.
W. Murray Crane, Senator Lodge,'
Reed Smoot and a lot of others came
in practically unannounced probably
becau.se a majority jf the delegates
did not even know them by sight.
Chauncey Depew was surrounded by:
a small admiring group.- Senator;
Penrose got a recognition fi'jm bis
own delegation. Gov. Whitman was
recognized by some but on the wt'jle
the convention v as more interested
in wondering what was going on in;
the Auditorium than it was in the ar-i
rival of the men who hitherto have;
decided what the convent'on should j
do with itself.
The hour for assembling was set
for ii o'clock but there was no sem -
. . . . i . . . , ..'.l n

one made auy pretense of securing it.
The delegates stood about the floor;
and talked, the spectators overflowed
into the spaces reserved for the del
egates and hundreds of seats on the
floor and in the galleries were empty.
Chairman Hilles gave signs of calling
the convention to order and the uni
formed police began moving about
urging the deleeates into their places.
Finally, at 11:28 o'clock. Chairman
Hillis brought down the gavel with
three refunding 'whacks and quiet

"The hour of 11 o'clock having ar

The band launched into the air and
led by a male quartette, the floor and
galleries joined in a mighty chorus
that swept through the big Coliseum.
There was a moment of confusion at
the end of the singing as the delegates
found their seats a gain and then the

CHICAGO. June 7. The Progressive national convention opened in the
Auditorium today with a record breaking demonstration for Colonel Roo.e-
velt. i
For one hour and thirty-three minnutes the delegate and spectators
roared, shouted, and cheered and applauded. They sang the Progressive
battle hymns, paraded the aisles and over the stage and howled down all
attempts to check them. The demonstration exceeded the previous record
for such arfairs of one hour and twenty-nine minutes established in the
Democratic convention in Denver In 190S In favor of Bryan which had ex

the band switched to "Marching

pont:Ir airs and the aisles became
so blocked that no one mover for sev
eral minutes. While the marchers
stood still in the jam. they kept up the
din, and after it had been going on one
hour. Geo. W. Perkins left the stage
and decided to go to his hotel and wr.it
for it to subside. The Michigan dele
gation ttamped in from the rain out

outdoor demonstration.

"Teddy is not afraid of the rain."
they shouted, "get out and march."
And In a body they filed from the hall
Into the deluee outside chanting "Ted

gates returned in their soggy gar
ments with banners and flags bedrag
gled and dripping, but their enthusi-J
asm was not dampened for they join
ed the marching, roaring throng again. '
The leaders, impressed by what
they realized might have been the dif-
ficuity of holding the convention from
proceeding to nomination, then derid-
ed on means to quiet the uproar.
"Let them yell." counselled one of the
leaders. "Now that they have shouted j

No Police Needed.
A proposal to use the uniformed po-.
lice to nueii tne demonstration was
discussed among the leaders, but it
was decided that the experiment was
too dangerous. ty this time some of
the enthusiasts who had ben waving
bandanas became dissatisfied witli
their efforts so they took off their
coats and waved them about their
heads. One delegate put a black
slouch hat with a bandana around the

"Whoopee" he roared, "She's in the

When Mr. Robins referred to Colo
nel RiHisevelt at another point as "tbe
favorite son of the' nation" th re was
nrother outburst and at t!i c!oe of
bis address there were yells of "three
cheers for Robins." The chairman
rapped them down with his gaTel, an-
nounred that the convention would
proceed with its business. He ex-
plained to the delegates that it was
told them. "We slixll move just as
fast as jHssible." With that the con
vention adjourned until tomorrow aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock. The only sug
gest'on of iiis ord came with a move
ment aeainst the selection of Walttr
Brown of Ohio as permanent chair
men. Those behind it wanted to pre
sent Governor Johnson of California
in Itrown's place. The governor
Uticklv sent word that he would be
a party to no discord. That ended it.
The announcement of temporary
committees was ended. The predic
tion that leaders would not be able t
hold their delegates from the nomina
tion of Colonel Roosevelt at the nien
t'n of his n!iie. did not materialize.
How long they will be able to control
them', however, is conceded by the
Progressive leadem themselves to be
doubtful.
