The effect of business failures Mr "lienor service in salesmanship, in- i ,,t the ,,, slm,)le- jr0od-hearted lit
Pow til discussed at some length He ' sufficient advertising or poor busi-, tk Ir, for uhom M)(1 ,,au b( en ,0(k
gave the following ligures. "In 1911 I ess methods is not emiipped to ful-in

11 ; there were in these same lines
0Jt.f failures in 111:,. last jear.
there were S.S74 failures In the last,
five vears the number of failures in
these four lines has increased at the'
rate tif almost 1 OOo a jear '
"In Columbia m the list ioar we i
have had no less than a dozen failures
in at least five lines of retail busi
ness Columbia should be an excel
lent business town, for it has an un
usuallv good trade terntorv and in
addition has a tremendous amount
from sthool and college population
thrown in '
The question ot the effect of these
failures upon the town as a whole and
the reason for the failures were mat
ters on which Mr Powell laid great
stress He said 'When a business
fails it il.ies hurt the town It un-
dermmes the confidence of the com-'
mmim ... nil rnt.ni business It mves
the town a bad name with manulac-
turers It keeps other business men

tainlv do hurt the retailers in other
lines of business Anil lastlj. it's an -
other boost for the mail-order people,
who are alreadv doing exactlv i per
cent ot the retail business of this
count rj '
ells of the 1 asiins.
In .K. (muting for these failures, the
speaker mentioned the usual reason
assigned insufficient capital, poor
buvmg too liberal credits These,
however he discount etl as being onlj
dI
oft
sons lack of proper investigation
the market poor bookkeeping that
failed to show the proper ratio of buv
ing and selling and lack of efficiencv
in selling and advertising
In support of these contentions, Mr
Powell read this letter written bv a
Johnson ( ountj farmer who thought o'clock this afternoon and made the
that town men needed an adviser as temporarj chairman, Ravmond Hob
baellv as did farmers ins. permanent chairman The routine
'The towns have been kind enough work was started linmediatelv
to give the farmers a farm adviser.' It is not definite! known whether
and it does look as if the farmers or not nominations will be made this
ought to do the right thing in return afternoon It is thought that some
