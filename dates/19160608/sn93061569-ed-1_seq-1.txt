s He is at Farmers Service

Which He Will Spend
Visiting Farm
Orren Beaty, County Agricultural
Agent, arrived in the city Saturday
morning of last week, purchased a
Ford from the Pioneer Garage yester

make a visit to every community in
;0 the county.
Mr. Beaty is an agreeable gentle
man, seems well versed in his work,
and says he will gladly render any as
sistance in his power to anyone in the
county wishing it. 'lie came here from
Walkertown, Indiana, his old home
town in which he has been a visitor
for the past two months, but he has
been assisting in experimental work
in the State of Oregon for the past
six - years.
Tie is an enthusiast in his line and
invites all to seek his assistance who
are planting crops from now on.
He made a tour of inspection of
the H. Herzstein Seed Co. this
afternoon and expressed his surprise
that such nice looking corn, milo, etc.
is raised here. vWe welcome Mr. Beaty
and The Citizen will give support and
assistance to help all parties concern
ed. He has promised us articles from

Orren Beaty,
County Agriculturist, Union County.
Folks North of Rabbit Ears Threaten
to Have "Some" Celebration
They say it will be one of the big
gest and best celebrations in the coun
ty and there is some reason for an as
sertion, as the hundreds who attended
the. celebration in the Stubblefield
grove last year will testify. When the
people north of the Rabbit Ears start
out to get up any kind of a celebra
tion it is sure to be a "hum dinger."
Those behind the celebration this
year were especially selected because
they were the ones who put the "Pep"
in pepper. They will use vast quanti
ties of "pep" in putting over this cel
ebration. There will be all kinds of
races, games, dancing etc. "Some
thing doing all the time" as the big
bills tell us.
Listen! If you really want to cel
ebrate the glorious fourth this year,
if you want to make the welkin ring
(whatever that is), if you want to
enjoy the biggest, best and jolliest ag
gregation of games, sports and mirth
making stunts, then be sure and at
tend the celebration of the glorious
Fourth to be held at the Stubblefield
Grove on the Corrumpa, east of the
Dish Rag crossing, on July 3rd and
4th. ,
Western Union Changes Again
The local Western Union Telegraph
office again changed management,
when R. R. Pearman resigned to go to
Denver for the present and perhaps to
the Philippine Islands in the near fu
ture. He will be succeeded here by Ray
Holmes, present day man for the C.
& S. Mr. Holmes will assume the lo
cal management as soon as the rail
road company sends his successor.
During his short stay here Mr.
Pearman has established the reputa
tion of prompt attention to customers
and has hustled new business in the
interests of his company.
Miss Kate Hamm and mother were
in from the ranch yesterday shopping
and visiting friends.
Events of the Week in
ugy J CAUGHT
MISS VERE DE VERE AGAIN ON
THE STAND
Q You are the same Miss Veré de
Vere who formerly testified in this
case?
A I am.
Q Did you state in your cross ex
amination that the Traveling Auditor
should have prepared and submitted a
report of his investigations of the
records of the officials which is entire
ly unintelligible in its ramblings, and
inaccurate?
A I did not. I stated that it is
the duty of the T. A. to audit the
records of the several county offices
carefully and accurately and to make
a report of his findings. This our T.
A. did and said report is a part of the
records of the county.
Q If this report is a part of the
records of the county why does the
Snooze attempt to discredit the work
of the T. A. and make such untrue
reports ?
A Politics. The Snooze believes
it can fool the people.
Q If the afore mentioned report
is a part of the records of the coun
ty, why does the Snooze not publish
same?
A Because to publish the report
would show to the people of Union
Co., the true status of official affairs
and the snooze is afraid of the truth.
Q Did the Snooze ask you the fol
lowing question: "Do you understand
that the law in force prior to the en
actment of the salary bill required of
ficials to keep accurate record of fees
collected and retained for services and
that upon enactment of the salary bill
they wuold have been in effect during
their incumbancy?"
A Yes the question was asked.
Q When was the salary bill pass
ed? A The salary bill was passed and
became a law in February, 1915.
G Does the sakry bill contain a
provision relative to salary or fees re
ceived prior to its passage?
A Section 9, of the salary bill con
tains a provision which reads as fol
lows: "Within 90 days from the date
of the passage of this act, each coun
ty officer shall file with the Board of
County Commissioners of his county,
a true, accurate and itemized account
under oath, showing all amounts and
monies heretofore received by him as
such officer, or by virtue of his office
from whatsoever source derived
; and at the time of filing such
accounts each county officer shall pay
into the treasury of his county all
amounts so received by him as afore
said, over and above the amounts for
which ho shall be entitled to credit as
above stated, etc.
Q Did each of the county officials
of Union county file such a report?
A Yes.
Q How long after the passage of
the salary bill was it before the audit
was made?

HIGH SCHOOLS
DESIRABLE
ARE
In my last article I mentioned the
enrollment in the Clayton school and
endeavored to set out the utter inad
equacy of our present school facilities,
I stated also that in my next article I
would give a general statement re
garding the building proposed for
erection by the Clayton Board of Ed
ucation.
The basement or ground floor is to
contain the domestic science room,
manual training room, a boiler room,
a fuel room, and the toilets. The sec
ond floor is to contain adequate cor
ridors, cloak rooms, an office, four
class rooms each thirty feet by twenty-two
feet eleven inches and a li
brary room twenty-eight feet eight
inches by twenty-two feet eleven
inches. The third floor is to contain
an assembly room with a seating ca
pacity of about six hundred fifty peo
pie. A good stage suitable to the
needs of such a building and two
1 An..
: dressing rooms 01 suineienl size
so
that same may be used for music
or
commercial purposes. In addition
to
this there is to be a laboratory am
one class room.
With a building such as the above
our physical equipment would be such
as to meet all renuisites and enable
us lo have an up.to.cate sehooi BUch

The Board has recently elected an
experienced, well educated and effici-
ent superintendent, J. E. Chamberlain,
to take charge of the Clayton schools.
Supt. Chamberlain has prepared a
course of study for the high school
that meets all requirements to place
it on the accredited list. This is the
first time in the history of the school
that this has ever been done. The
Board will under all probability
adopt the outlined course. But in or
der to carry out this course of
study the high school must have
more room and equipment for its
work than it has at the present time.
The scholastic enumeration of Dis
trict No. 1 for the present year is
422. The enrollment of the Clayton
schools for the year just ended was
' 510. When we consider the fact that

J. J. BROPHY SUCCUMBS
TO LINGERING ILLNESS
His Demise Attributed to Ef
fects of Ptomaine Poison
ing and Shock from
Son's Tragic End
J. J. Brophy, one of the earliest res
idents of Union county, and pro-ninent
in the public life of the city and coun
ty, passed over the Groat Divide Sun
day morning at 3:35 a. m., after an
illness of about ten days. His death is
a shock to many cf his old friends,
though his health has been very poor
for the past five months, in fact ever
since the death of his eldest son, which
occurred about a year ago, and to
which Mr. Bronhy never became re
conciled.
Requiem Mass was held Monday
at 9 a. m. and the funeral services
took place at 2 o'clock in the after
noon, Kev. father Dumarest ofliciat-
mg. the casket was heaped with
flowers, tributes of loving friends. The
pall bearers were C. U. Bridges, A. C.
Miera, J. M. Gonzales, Dick Carson,
John Spring and Tom Gray. Inter
ment was made in the Masonic ceme
tery by the side of his son, Frank,
whose death was such a blow to him
and was partially the cause of his
death.
John Bronhy was a unique chara
cter, absolutely fearless and with iron
nerve. He was born m Michigan but
came to Texas when a small boy and
took to "punching cattle" as a duck
tnkes to water. lie came from Doby
Walls, to Tascosa, Texas, which was
one of the early gathering places for
all westerners. Trail herds always
made Tascosa a stopping place and it
has a foremost place in the early his
tory of this country. He was fore
man of a ranch for several years, and
when John King, now of Trinidad
was elected sheriff of Oldham Coun
ty he appointe 1 Mr . Brophy as
deputy. After Mr. King's term of of
fice had expired, John went to Dodge
City, Kansas, where lie was cattle in
spector for several years, lie was
called back to Tascosa to become fore
man of the L. S. ranch which position
he held for about two years. He mar
ried Miss Rosa Duran, and took up
residence in Clayton. He has been
United States Deputy Marshal, Dep
uty Sheriff, and City Marshal at dif
ferent times since living here. He
moved to Tucumoari, where he went
into business for himself but, liking
Clayton better, he came back after a
two year's absence and remained hero
until his death.
His eldest son accidentally shot him
self about a year ago and the shock
was a groat blow to his parents. Mr.
Brophy was never the same man after
this happened. About live months
ago he had a severe attack of pto
maine poisoning and he steadily failed
since, not seeming to have any desire
to live. He was a devoted husband
and father and loved his family with
great intensity. He is survived by a
wife, who is heartbroken over the loss
of both husband and son in a year's
time, and a son, John Jr. The family
have the sincere sympathy of the
entire community in their sorrow.

lain of Ellis, Kansas, was accepted by

ly recommended, as his record shows

work. He is a graduate of the Em
poria State Normal and holds a life
certificate from that college. He was
city superintendent at Lacygne, Kan
sas, for a period of four years, prin
cipal of the Thomas County High
School at Colby for four years, and
served as superintendent at Ellis for a
period of five years.

State Teachers Association and pres
ident of the Golden Belt Educational

puoils. He says he is planning to
build a residence and remain here in
definitely. He is a great advocate of
manual training anil domestic science
and says he has had much exper
ience in these lines of work.
