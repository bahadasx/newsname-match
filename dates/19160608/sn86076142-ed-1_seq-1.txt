CHICAGO, June 8. Developments of the last 24 hours make it
plain that neither the Republican nor Progressive convention will In
able to come to the point of milking a nomination before Friday with
prospects of being delayed beyond that time. One clear fact seems
to stand out among a maze of reports and' rumors. .That was that
Hughes has become stronger from hour to hour.
POSSIBLE PEACE FUSION
Discussions of a possible peace fusion of the two parties assumed
a more concrete form today when a rumor is becoming persistent
that Roosevelt might come to Chicago to appear before the conven
tions in the role of a pacificator.
Republican leaders, who discussed the proposal to invite Roose
velt, decided it was said, that if Roosevelt is prepared to declare him
self out of the contest and enter into an agreement for the selection
of the Republican candidates, an invitation will be forthcoming.
WESTERN PROGRESSIVES INSISTENT
Contrary to this view, leading Progressives declare Roosevelt will
be nominated by the Progressives regardless of what is done by the
Republican convention.
Governor Johnson, of California, it was declared, would' be nom.
inated for vice-president and that nominations eome before midnight
tonight. ' V . :.
Word went out today that a peace conference between the
responsible leaders of both parties might begin before nightfall.
The delay yesterday, some Republicans said, was due to lack of
authority in the rules adopted for a temporary orgunizution. The
authority was forthcoming, however, it was said, in the new rules.
From Progressive quarters came rumors that certain western
Progressive delegations were solidly set against fusion or peace.
While there has been little real diseussian among Republicans
of vice-presidential possibilities, considerable talk was heard today
indicating there might be concentration either on Fairbanks or
Burton. . , ' '
PLANKS AGREED UPON
The Republican sub-eonimittee on resolutions adopted a plank
relative to ilexicaan relations offered by Senator Fall which is a
strong attack on the administration's policy. Other planks adopted'
favored labor, Americanism, national defense and other questions
adopted to meet a progressive sentiment.
Planks for the reeall, initiative and referendum were rejected by
the subcommittee.
SKELETON OP THE PLATFORM
Ringing declarations for Americanism and preparedness, mili
tary, economic and industrial are the keynotes of a progressive na
tional platform to be completed today with the co-operation of the
Republican convention) platform builders.' Progressive leaders hope
to present the document to the convention today.
