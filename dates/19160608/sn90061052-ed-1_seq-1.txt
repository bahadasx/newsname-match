I Carthage Evening Press
The school board met in called scs
lo Saturday evening and elected
Wmar T Stevens principal and Miss
Hess Howen teacher in the high school
thus filling all vacancies in the teach
ing f6rce of the Jasper school for the
comlngyear The board had previous
ly elected Miss Gresham to fill the
place as the third teacher in the high
school but she accepted a place in the
Lamar school before she received the
notification from Jasper Miss Rowcu
live3 at Tulsa Okla and is n grad
uate of Drury College at Springfield
Shoicomes highly commcndedby the
school officials
Mr Stevens is a school man of 2i
years teaching experience in Missouri
Kansas and Oklahoma He taught last
year in the Kansas Citv schools The
Jasper board feels that the corps of
teachers engaged for next year is a
little the best taken as a whole that
has ever been secured for ouf schools
and we may expect a larger measure of
progress and improvement than ever
before
One member of this years graduat
ing class has applied for entry at the
State University for the year begin
ning in September His rating and
work here was readily accepted by the
University as was also the work of last
years graduates From this we under
stand that Jasper is well rated at the
State University
In this connection we might add a
word to nonresidents who nre bending
their children to Jasper schools and
assure them that they are getting as
much or more for their tuition and
other costs as they would if they sent
their children to schools irt some larger
towns

Hull is one of the best known fanners

grain men in this country and wc hope
he will find it to his advantage to re

The business of the cooperative ele
vator has been very satisfactory and
has proven the wisdom of the under

however certain seasons of the year
reduce business to a point down to and
in some cases below the cost of oper

Take a Tip From Mother Nature
Maybe the house needs a coat of paint the fence out
buildings or screens u little dingy How about the
woodwork in the house and the floors Do they need
a little brightening Does the furniture show
scratches Painting and varnishing not only beauti
fies but it makes the wood last longer and its really
cheaper to paint than not
