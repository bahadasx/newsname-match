Seeing Berea
Berea belongs to you.
Every mountain home in Kentucky, or the Virgin
ias, or the Carolinias has a ihare in this great school.
As you walk over the campus today, remember that these
buildings and these teachers are here to help you and
your children.
The cost of schooling at Berea has not increased
during the twenty-four years of Presidents Frost's admi
nistration. Everything is more costly, but schooling at
Berea is still within reach of every family that has grit
and common sense.
You see what others have done; your sons and
daughters can do as well.
And Berea trains people for different things farm
ers, housekeepers, teachers, carpenters, nurses, printers,
and all the other callings, It has something good for
every comer.
Plan now for your son or daughter to be here the
first day of the Fall Term, September 13th.

GROUP OF BEREA GIRLS
Berea's moot beautiful exhibit is always its students. This represents
a group of girls taken some time ago. Several of these girls hava
already graduated, but most of them will be bark at Commencement this
year.
Three Errands Today
Three things each visitor should accomplish today.
First-Subscribe for THE CITIZEN.
The Citizen gives you news from Berea and Berea's
teachings every week of the year. No other paper is
looking out for the interest of the mountains and thire
people as The Citizen does.
The Citizen has something good for each member
of the family.
Lvery week there will be at least one thing in the
paper that is worth the whole years subscription. Call
at the booth or see the agents on the grounds. The
Citizen is your paper.
. Second See exhibits, hear Tabernacle speeches.
Each time the cannon fires the Tabernacle doors
are open, and a new set of exercises ready to begin. You
will take home the things you hear and see to think
over many a good day.
Third Make a Gift for Kentucky HalL
Berea has many buildings, but not enough. We
are obliged to send students away every winter. Stu
dents and citizens and neighbors of Berea have made
a generous start. But this is a big building. Every
man or woman who sets foot on the Campus today
owes Berea and the mountains a gift for Kentucky Hall.

JOHN E. CALFEE
Professor Calfee retires from Berea'a service after eight
years, being called to the chief place in a large educational
enterprise planned by the Presbyterians for rtn Carolina.
May he develop a new Berea! Our love auiJod-speed go
with him.
DO YOUR PART FOR KENTUCKY HALL
IV-re a asks every Kenturkian here
today to make some gift or pledge
for the new girls' building to be
named Kentucky Hall.
Here are a few reasons:
1. For three years Berea has been
turning away students because ev
ery loom was crowded in the win
ter term. The growth of the School
is strangled, and hundreds of young
people disappointed for life.
2. llerea has only half as many
girls as boys. The great need is
more shelter for girls.
3. " A great deal of money has
been given to llerea from the Kant
aitd the North it is lime Kentucky
did more for this, her' most famous
school.
4. Everybody ran give some
thing. The poorest boy or girl can
get into llerea: the poorest man or
woman ran be a partner and helper
of Iterea.
5. The cost will be 100,000. Of
this tlA.000 has been given by the
rilixens of Berea, students and
teachers. The other 40,000 ran be
raised twice over if people will help
according to their ability.
5.000 people could give 12 each,
total, 110,000.
2,000 people could give 95 each,
total flO.000.
1,000 people could give $10 each,
-total 110,000.
200 people could give 900 each,
total, 110,000.
loo people could give 9100 each,
total 910,000.
20 people could give 9500 each,
total 910,000.
10 people could give 91,000 each,
total 910,000.
5 people could give 93000 each,
total 910.000.

Rsrival at Irvine
Dr. E. G. B. Mann, assisted by Rev.
Robert Lear, of Marion, recently
closed a two week's revival at , Ir
vine, preaching in the morning on
the Court Green or in some of the
business bouses to the men and in
the church in the afternoon and
evening. The meetings were well
attended and Brother Mann preached
with great power and Brother Lear's
leadership in singing conduced no
little to the success of the meet,
ing. He also preached upon several
occasions producing an extremely
favorable impression. He became
a great favorite with the people.
There were fourteen additions to
the church but the great feature ol
the meeting was the revival of tho
faith of believers and the quicken
ing of the church.

First Road Construction to Start
Knox County
Knox County's first road construe,
tion work will be started on the
1 four-mile extension from Flat Lick
to the Bell County line, this being a
portion of the Dixie Highway and
the only contract in Knox County
approved by the State Engineer.
Contracts awarded by the County
authorities for two other extensions,
one down Cumberland River and an
other toward Clay County, failed to
meet wKh State approval.
Itespuiring of getting a cross
county route this year, local busi
ness men have raised a fund for re
pairing the highway between Bar
bourville and the Bell line, and work
is being started under the supervi
sion of former County Judge J. T.

WORLD HEWS
During the week while official
comment is withheld, it is under
stood that the tone of Gen. Car
ranza'i note demanding withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico,
is regarded as decidedly offensive
and certain portions of it, such as
the thinly-veiled accusation that the
President i playing domestic poli
tics in retaining troops in Mexico,
may draw a sharp rebuke. The Pres
ident is determined to maintain
the present troop disposition until
the ability of the de facto govern
ment to police its side of the bor
der is demonstrated.
The British and . German fleets
were engaged in a long battle In the
North Sea off the coast of Denmark
May 31.
The first news of the great battle
came through German sources, the
British statement followed soon
after. Various estimates of the
casualties have been mafte, but
since some of the vessels were of
that type which required a com
plement of from 800 to 1.000 men,
the loss will doubtless total thou
sands. (Cuullnued oa pars Four.)
