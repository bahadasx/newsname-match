In one of the worst dust storms cf
the year, Heppner and lone met In
the second game of tne season on the
Egg city diamond last Sunday after
noon. A large number of fans ac
companied the local team on their
voyage of conquest and revenge, but
after the dust had settled Just as Neal
was called out at first, in the first
chapter of the ninth inning, the hopes
of fan and team alike were routed.
The score stood lone 4, Heppner 1.
One of the features of the game
was the fact that in spit of the
scoring there was not an earned run.
Chrlstensen, playing third was the
only man completing the circuit tor
Heppner. -
Sperry, pitching for Tone, struck
out 7 men while Fulwider retired
only one by this method., There
were few hits on either side and both

one in that it seemed an Impossible
one to get.
The batting honors were pretty
evenly divided among the heavy hitt

and A. Cochran tied tor first place
in this respect. For Heppner, Neal

Ralph Hymer, former manager of
Mun'B Tigers, officiated as umpire and
his decisions met with approval from
both sides in spite of the fact that
it was almost impossible to see the
ball at times, so thick was the dust.

THIRD ANNUAL FARMERS' PICNIC IN
HEPPNER SATURDAY JUNE SEVENTEENTH
The third annual picnic of the Mor-j
row County Farmers' Union will be
held at the fair grounds in this city
on Saturday, the seventeeth day of
June. This was the decision arrived:
at by the members of the local union
at their moctlng laot Saturday after
noon. It had been known every

was to entertain this year but the de-;

NOT FIT FOR MARKET
Method of Preserving Eggs
Is
for
Rome Consumption Only,
uy tiyman h. uonen, in uregon j
Journal.
While eggs in waterglass are con
sidered good, there is no demand at
all for them in the markets.
Many farmers who 'have put up
eggs in waterglass during : recent
years and have afterwards shipped
them to thewholesale markets, have
discovered to their dismay that there
i practically no sale for them except
at extreme low prices. Even then
there Is little call for them.
Many country Interests have tried
to ship eggs to market that have
been put up in waterglass and have
said nothing regarding this to the
wholesaler. Seemingly, the country'
shipper wanted to see whether he
could market this stock as freshly
laid eggs, but every wholesaler knew
instantly that the stock was not fresh.
In all of the city wholesale hous?
they employ one or more men whoso
duty is to "candle" eggs carefully,
to grade them according to quality.
An expert candler will Instantly dis
cover Just what the supplies are.
In fact so many cases of eggs are
handled in a single day along the
street that even the express men
know by lifting the cases whether the
stock is of extra quality.
If the weight is light, they know
a once that either the case has not
been fully packed, the eggs of small
size, or simply not fresh. Eggs lose
weight In keeping, therefore It is idle
for anyone to try to "put one over"
on the wholesaler.
Last fall there was much complaint
from some country shippers because
they did not secure top prices for
their eggs. The wholesalers were
forced to explain to each of them
that the eggs did not come up to
standard or had gone through a pro
cess for keeping them. I personally
know of the shipment of 10 cases of
eggs from one country shipper dur
ing the winter when eggs were scarce,
who does not ship more than two or
three cases at a time -when supplies
are plentiful. This one fact was alone
sufficient to cause the city receiver
to believe that something was wrong
with the shipment. He quickly dis
covered that the stock was water-
glassed, although the shipper had no
tified him that he was sending him
10 cases of fresh stuff.
THOMAS QCAID.
Thomas Quald, Morrow eounty pio
neer who died In Portland on May 28,
was born In Ireland on the 8th day of

Many of the fields to the north of
lone are badly Infested with Jim Hill
mustard, so-called. - It has only been
in the past two or three years that
this weed pest has shown up in this
section, but it has spread very fast
and our farmers now have a time in
getting rid of it. The vacant lands
and the lanes along the county roads
are so badly infested at present that
there seems to be small hope of the
wheat raisers doing anything to rid
their fields of the weed as they will
be seeded from the roads and vacant
lands.
French Burroughs is making good
use of his jitney as an adjunct to hist
farm appliances. He has purchased
a trailer and In this he can place his
crates of eggs and ?ans as usual, with
other produce for the market and

The trailer does not cost a great deal
and we look for more or our farmers
now that they are using autos so
generally, to adopt this convenience
as it would add much to the service-
ableness of their machines.
J. S. Williams departed Tuesday

The senior Mr. Honey is one of the

just recently had a new well sunk on
one of their properties here, the farm
now occupied by Ed Buschke. The
work was done by Fred Ntchoson,
who secured a fine flow of water at a
depth of 120 feet, and Mr. Honey Is
arranging to have another well bored.
The Oregon-Dakota people are begin
ning to grasp the idea of progress and
will make considerable improvements
on their holdings here, for all ot
which the people of this end of the
county should be very thankful. We
would not criticise these people be
yond what others deserve also, but It
is a fact that cannot be disputed, that
this part of Morrow county suffers
much from the land owner who simp
ly buys up lands here for speculative'
purposes, and who is not willing to
spend some of his money in keeping
the lands cultivated and improved.
Thousands of acres of splendid wheat
lands are now grown up to weeds and
have become a menace to' those farms
adjoining and are causing their own

City Council Will Amend Ordinance
And Prohibit Building Board
Walks On Gale And Inter
vening Streets.
There will be no more board
walks on Gale street and intervening
streets after the present city ordin
ance pertaining to building permits
for sidewalks has been amended. Tbe
council decided to amend the present
ordinance, which at this time In
cludes only Main street and after the
amendment has been made, it will be
unlawful to replace any board walks
on Gale street or any streets crossing
Gale, with board walks, or to con
struct new board walks where there
are none at the present time. ' The
amendment was suggested by coun
cilman McCarty. In taking this
course, the council to striving to fol
low out their program of civic im
provement and they are of the opin
ion that concrete walks fill an im
portant place In this program.
The council decided to appropriate
(35 to the fund which will be used in
fuming the waters of Ditch creek in
to the Willow creek channel. The
matter was fully explained by C. A.
Minor, who Is acting as chairman of
a committee from the Heppner Com
mercial Club in raising the money
and putting the ditch through. .It
means (nuch to the city of Heppner if
this water is diverted into the Willow
creek channel for it assures us of
running water' the whole year
through. It will also be a great boon
to creek farmers who depend upon ir
rigation for crop Insurance. Nearly
enough money has now been sub
scribed to put the ditch through in
proper form.
A railing will be constructed along
the banks of Willow creek where the
old Gale street bridge formerly stood.
The old street has never been closed
at this point and was considered of
