GREAT NAVAL BATTLE
OFF JUTLAND.
BRITISH ADMIRALTY ASSERTS
I GERMANS LOST EIGHTEEN MEN !
O'WAR IN THE FIGHT.
The greatest sea fight in modern
times took place on the afternoon
and evening of May 31, off Jutland, :
i in the North Spa. between the Ger-ll
mac High Seas Fleet and a portion <
of the British navy. The first news <
of the battle came from Berlin, by i
wireless to Sayville, and claimed a I
great German victory. The British
loss in men and ships was at first 1
1 reported to be considerably greater
than the German. i
) On Monday the British admiralty 1
) issued a statement saying there was i
5 the strongest ground for the belief 1
) that the British navy in the battle 1
? with the Germans off Jutland last <
> week had accounted for a total of 1
) eighteen German men of war and <
| that there was nothing to add to or <
subtract from the original announce>
I ment of the British losses. i
} The statement gave the German
j losses as two battleships, two dreadnaught
battle cruisers, four light
) cruisers, nine torpedo boat destroyers
and a submarine,
j A dispatch from Copenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
| two additional German warships
than those announced in the German
) communication?the battleship West- ,
falen and the battle cruiser Lutzow? ,
j were sunk in the battle. A wireless \
dispatch received in London Satur- ,
i day, from Berlin said the German ,
1 o^miroltv ortmiM-pH fhp lfiRS nf t.hp .
Westfalen.
I The admiralty statement Monday t
night declares that the German losses
> in the fight were not only relatively j
but absolutely greater than those of g
' the British. Maintaining its prac- \
i tice of caution, the admiralty still ?
| refrains from giving the names of
the lost German ships.
The official list of the casualties
; among the officers shows that hardly
a single officer of the line escaped
| from the British cruisers sunk in
the battle. An additional casualty
' list of petty officers shows that fori
ty-three of them were saved from
the Queen Mary, Invincible, For1
tune, Ardent and Shark. None was
saved from the Indefatigable, De(
fence, Black Prince, Tipperary, Turbulent,
b^pmad or Nestor,
i Admiral Lord Beresford, in an interview,
while contending strongly
for tne view tnat tnere was no iauure
in the British strategy and that
Vice Admiral Beatty won a brilliant
success, though it was dearly bought,
declared that the only mistake made
was by the admiralty in allowing
the Germans to get first in the field
with the news of the battle, or as
he puts it, with "impudent fabrications."
Otherwise, said Lord Beresford,
no fault can be found with the
admiralty.

ENGLAND'S WAR CHIEF
AND STAFF DEAD,
KITCHENER, MINISTER OF WAR.
PERISHES WHEN CRUISER GOES
DOWN OFF ORKNEY ISLANDS.
London, June 6:?The news that
Earl Kitchener, Secretary of State
for War, and his staff, who were
proceeding to Russia aboard the
cruiser Hampshire, were lost off the
Orkney Islands last night, was the
most stunning diow ureal Britain
has received since the war began.
This is the second shock the country
has sustained within a week,
rhe other was when the newspapers
appeared Friday evening with the
first intelligence of the naval battle
in the North Sea in the form of a
list of the ships lost, with practically
no intimation that there was any
lompensation in the way of enemy
losses. The bulletin telling of the
ieath of Kitchener gave the country
>ven a greater shock.
Kitchener was the one outstanding
personality whom the people
talked of and believed in as a great
man, notwithstanding newspaper attacks,
which at a former period of
the war threatened to undermine
bis popularity and the public confidence
in him
JELLICOE'S REPORT.
A telegram from Admiral Sir John
Jellicoe, commander of the fleet,
jiving the bare facts, was received
at the admiralty about 11 o'clock in
the morning. This official announcement
was issued about 1:30 in the
afternoon. Before noon, however,
umors were spreading.
Admiral Jellicoe's report to the
idmiralty follows:
"I have to report with deep regret
that his Majesty's ship Hampihire,

OPENING OF THE

KINGSTREE WILL PLAY THRE
GAMES WITH LAMAR ON THE
HOME GROUND NEXT WEEK.
The Pee Dee Baseball league wi
open its season Monday, June 1:
when Kingstree's "Red Sox" wi

the Lamar team at Kingstree; Bei
nettaville will play at Bishopvil
and the Florence team will play i
Dillon, according to the schedu
mapped out by the executive con
mittee of the association.
Local fans are looking forward t
the opening games with great inte:
est and enthusiasm,and they are n(
the least bit reserved in their pri
dictions as to what their favorit
team is going to do for the rest c
the clubs. Kingstree's "Red Sox
are already slated to win the per
nant in the first half of the thirt:
game series; Florence is booked 1
win the second half, then Kingstre
is to win over Florence in the chan
pionship contest at the end of th
season. This is the way local far
have cast their predictions for tt
home team. Whether such predi<
tions have merit or not. we shall nc
venture an assertion. However, th
Kingstree team is composed of goc
ball players,as good, perhaps, as wi
be found in the amateur field, an
we gather from unbiased critics tl
opinion that this team's prospecl
for a successful season are exceei
ingly good. Then, again, accordin
to the statements or Manager tsi
and President W R Scott, who bas
their judgment upon the individu,
work of the team on the field hei
board, was sunk last night at aboi
8 o'clock to the west of the Orkney
either by mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by obser
ers on shore to leave the ship. T1
wind was north-northwest and hea\
seas were running. Patrol vesse
and destroyers at once proceeded 1
the spot and a party was sent alon
the coast to search, but only son:
bodies and a capsized boat have bee
found up the present. As the whol
shore has been searched from sei
ward I greatly fear that there
. little hope of there being any sui
vivors.
"No report has yet been receive
from the searching party on short
