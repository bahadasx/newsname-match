CHAPTER XV.
A Large Surprise For Each of the Girls.
LEDGE began his deliberate
'^ 5 , siege upon Molly with the same
care and vigor that ho would
have exercised in conducting n
i-iost important political campaign.
On that first evening at the theater
iie made Molly's wishes, expressed or
unexpressed, both a study and a law.
A draft blew on her. She had a scarf
around her shoulders before she was
'O.'ongli with her first slight shiver.
; ah! immediately thereafter Sledge
•■'•L'Ppod his fingers for an usher and
ordered the fire escape doors closed,
■'-be looked over the program of
„•iHf'aete music and sighed for a miss
ing favorite.
' Write it down," directed Sledge,
invading her a fountain pen and a
■'d.ek blank.
toughing, she wrote it, thinking that
At would no doubt send her the sheet
music next day.
Again be called the usher.
''Take this to Joe, and tell him to
have it played,'' lie ordered. "Any
thing else you'd like, Miss Molly?"
"I'm afraid to mention a wish for
fear I'd get it," she laughed In more
or less embarrassment. But Fern, who
was having the time of her life, gig
gled and, telling him to recall the boy,
added a favorite of her own to the
musical program.
"You can have a good time most any
place," Sledge complimented her, with
a growing fondness for Molly's friend.
"You're a nice kid. 1 ought to have
invited your gentleman friend along."
"I don't see who it would be," laugh
ed Fern. "Molly knows so many nice
chaps, but the most of them are such
boys."
"Excuse me a minute, girls," begged
Sledge and unloomed himself from the
background.
"Where now has ho gone?" wondered
Molly, half amused and half apprehen
sive.
"He's probably noticed that some
girls have candy," surmised Fern, who
had come to believe him infallible.
"He'll bring back a ton of it."
"I hope he isn't going to order the
spotlights turned this way," snickered
Molly. "He'd do it, I think. He's ca
pable of anything."
"As long as it's nice," admitted Fern.
"I'll bet you never had a man treat
you with more respect"
"That's true enough. He's rather a
surprise to me in that. He's a tine
friend to have, Fern."
Just as the overture struck up Sledge
returned to the box, followed by a
large handed man of about thirty-five,
whose face and neck were red from
much cheerful exposure to the weath
er. He bad a merry blue eye and pom
padour hair, and he ^ore diamond
shirt studs and cuff buttons.
"Tommy Reeler, girls," introduced
Sledge. "Miss Fern Burbank, Tommy.
Miss Molly Marley."
Mr. Reeler in great heartiness and
in friendliness all unafraid shook
hands with both the girls and sat down
by Fern.
"I'm in luck," he confided to the
crowd. "I was feeling lonesome enough
to take a drink when Ren dug me up
and slipped mo the news that bo bud a
girl for ma How do you like our
town, Miss Fern?"
"I love it," returned Fern, not dar
ing to look at Molly, whose brimming
eyes she knew to be fixed upon her.
Under the crescendo of the music
the conversation became paired off,
and Sledge, with complacent self ap
probation. watched the couple in front
of him.
"Tommy's a right guy," he confided
to Molly. "Big contractor, paving and
city buildings. Wife died last winter."
"That was too bad," responded Mol
ly sympathetically.
"She was due." declared Sledge. "I'd
'a' killed her."
"Was she so dreadful?" Inquired
Molly, forcing her share of the con
versation.
"A souse," grunted Fledge. "Tom
my don't touch it, but she got a dif
ferent kind of a Heinz on every
night."
"Drank?" guessed Molly, trying to
remember for Fern's benefit.
"For the family." Sledge corroborat
ed, "and all this time Tommy a decent
guy. lie deserves a good woman, but
be don't get to meet 'em. He'd be a
great pal for your little friend if she
can nail him."
"I uever heard Fern express a pref
erence for widowers," she suggested.
"He's the same as not," Sledge as
sured her. "There's no kids. Tom
rny's a grand boy."
The music struck a pianissimo pas
sage.
"Me for a blond." Tommy Reelcr
unintentionally explained to the audi
ence. and before she could stop it the
clear silvery giggle of Fern blended
with the piccolo obligato.
Reeler looked around at Sledge with
a broad grin and nodded his head em
phatically in the direction of Fern.
"Having a nice party?" asked Molly
softly, bending forward. But Fern
was speechless.
The curtain rose, and the play be
gan. and Sledge, bending knotted
brows upon the stage, sat decently
aloof. If anybody litëèd this sort of
I hing far be it from lim to interfere
with their pleasure. Bltween the acts,
however, he rame right back on the
job. He arranged for Tommy an«
himself lo take the girls out to see the
new .waterworks plant ou the follow
ing day and to witness as balcony pa
trons on the following night a barn
dance of the West End elnb. He plan
ned a Country club dinner for the day
after, and then reaching nonchalantly
into his waistcoat pocket he dropped
into Molly's lap a glittering bauble,
which looked like a glass hickory nut.
"Take that down to Duvay's and
have it fitted to your finger," he di
* reeled. f
She picked it up incredulously. It
couldn't be real! 4
"Why, it's a diamond!" she gasped
ns it lay Hashing and gleaming in her
hand, and she saw the perfect cutting
and wonderful fire of if. The realiza
tion startled her so that she almost
dropped it.
"It had better be or somebody goes
to jail," he informed her. "That rock
set me back the price of a house and
lot."
"But. Mr. Siedge, 1 can't accept this,"
she earnestly assured him.
"Why not?" he demanded, studying
her heavily. "You're to be my wife."
She was panic stricken more by his
look than his words.
A
for oue
"It's too large for a? rin
ihiug," she evaded. -f
"Why?" he again rumbled.
She decided to leave opt the question
of good taste.
"You couldn't put a glove over if,"
.-die explained.
He looked at it reproachfully.
"Hunhl" he commcijfed. "It's a
peach, though, aiu't it?"
Here was a proposition on which she
could heartily agree.
"It's a beauty—a marvel!" she enthu
siastically told him, ashamed, in some
degree, that she so much admired the
live tiling as it lay in her palm.
She handed it over to him, and as his
palm touched hers she felt the tingle
of him for the first time. It was as if
she had inadvertently touched an elec
tric. battery, and she jerked back her
hand.
Between them they dropped the dia
mond, and it rolled under Fern's chair.
Tommy Rceler picked it up.
"Swell pebble. Ben," he approved
and poured it into Fern's hand, where
it lay glittering and glittering and glit
tering and would not be still.
"Oh, you darling!" Fern murmured
to iL "Where did this d>t>p from?"
"Present for Molly," explained Sledge
modestly. "Too big for a ring. Can't
pull a glove over it. I'mtgoana have it
set in a necklace."
Three days later the necklace came
out, but by that time Molly had given
up all hope of heading Sledge off. The
only thing she could do, she resolved,
in a hilarious conference with Fern,
would be to accept temporarily any
crazily extravagant gift he showered
upon her. After the need for fooling
him was over she could send them
back, and this resolution, once having
been formed, the girls spent much
time in eager expectation of what the
next surprise might be. Sledge was at
least making the game exciting, and
his perfectly mad. but equally earnest,
antics gave both Molly and Peru more
fun than they had ever known.
In the meantime, while Sledge and
his cheerful co-worker. Tummy Reeler,
were keeping the girls busy day and
night the preparations fur the secret
wedding went steadily on, as did the
business [.reparations of Bert and
Frank Marley. Thanksgiving day ap
proached. and things began to focus
themselves in the Marley home. The
representative of the up state syndi
cate came to town on schedule. He
spent three days In going over the
hooks of the company and examining
into Marley's loans. Also, he looked
up the matter of the franchises. The
company had been given originally a
twenty year city charter, which had
been twice renewed for ten year pe
riods. its present renewal having three
years to run.
"It looks like the regular thing." he
said to Marley. "I'm satisfied to give
you thirty-six straight through for
your stock, take up your loans and al
low you the difference in value; but,
before I do business. I'll have to see
Sledge about this franchise."
"It was part of our understanding
that you were to stay away from him,"
insisted Marley. "If your presence
and your errand here are known,
Sledge wiil do something destructive.
He has it in for me and will wipe me
right off the map."
'Tie might have it in for me, and I
have to see wlnt he can do."
"I'll make it $34 a share, and you
see him afterward." offered Marley.
"Now, I'm bound to see him," de
clared Mr. Coldman, who was a wiry
little man. of great energy and de
cisiveness. "Don't you worry. He
won't connect me with you. I've been
in this game too long uot to lie able to
cover my tracks.".
Coldman's interview with Sledge
was brief, concise and satisfactory,
and he began by stating exactly who
he was and whom he represented.
"We're looking for street car bar
gains." he explained, "and we've been
advised that stock in the Ring City
street railway is well worth picking
up at its present price. Do you think
so?"
"Uh-hunh!" granted Sledge. "None
for sale, though."
"It does seem to be scarce." admitted
Goldman. "Still, we'll take what we
can get if it looks good. 1 understand
î here's some talk of consolidation."
"Uh-hunli!" granted Sledge.
"That would probably bring the
stock up to par." judged Coldman.
"Can't tell." commented Sledge.
"is there any trouble about renewal
uf franchises?" inquired Coldman, pon
dering deeply upon whether Sledge was
remarkably frank or remarkably adept
In seeming so.
"Guess not." said Sledge. "I got a
date," and he went to keep it, wearing
his new Prince Albert and his silk hat,
his gray gloves and Ills red rosebud
with such complacency as almost to in
duce Phil to give up Ids job.
Marley went home intoxicated with
elation that night.
"Molly, girl, we've won!" he announc
ed. "Go ahead with your wedding to
morrow, and be as open about it as
you like. Tomorrow ! lift the mort
gage ou this house and sell it to Murd
stone, who has offered to buy it as
soon as I can give it to him unencum
bered. 1 have already sold my stock
and Bert's, including the amusement
park; have delivered it. and here is the
check."
"I told you we would win!" exulted
Molly and ran with the news to Fern.
"I'm sorry," confessed that young
Y>dy. "The fun's all over."
"It was fun, wasn't it?" admitted
Molly, startled to find that she almost
regretted the ending of it "You still
have Tommy, though."
"No," denied Fern, "I'll have to put
Tommy in my pretty little blue ear and
send them back together. Poor Sledge!"
"Here's where he gets the first blow,"
sighed Molly. "You have to go up and
phone him that I'm ill and cau't see
him tonight nor tomorrow."
"Coward!" hissed Fern, In mock
tragedy and went in to telephone. She
came back slowly. "Poor fellow!" she
said. "Honestly, It's a shame, Molly."
Molly herself was rather listless. She
was standing in front of a huge vase
containing Sledge's latest consignment
of red roses. She broke off one of the
most perfect specimens and pinned it
at her belt.
"Poor fellow!" she agreed; then her
eyes snapped. "I'm going to make him
send me his dog."
"1 wouldn't dare," declared Fern
"I'd feel miserable every time he bark
ed. I wonder what Sledge will do to
night" ____

CHAPTER XVI.
Interesting News For the Big Boy.
LEDGE did what any other fool
lover wonld have done. He tel
epboned three times that even
ing to see how Molly was. and
when he went home he drove two miles
out of the way to pass the house. He
was equally solicitious the uext morn
ing and handled his business with sin
gular lack of concentration. The last
two weeks had made him more slavish
ly iu love with Molly than ever, and
he missed her ns a morphine fiend does
bis "dope."
Coldman dropped in to'see him at 2
o'clock.
v **l want to talk consolidation with
you, Mr. Sledge," he offered, sitting
smilingly in the visitor's chair.
"What consolidation?" asked Sledge.
"The street railway companies. Wc
have just purchased the controlling in
terest in the company now operative."
Sledge turned on him a slow glance.
"From Frank Marley?" he demanded.
"From Frank Marley," repeated Cold
man pleasantly, looking as if ho ex
peeted to be applauded for his enter
prise.
"You're up against it," Sledge wars
ed him. "Did you pay?"
"Gave Marley my check yesterday
afternoon."
"Today's a holiday," advised Sledge
"Better stop payment" m
"I don't understand," faltered Cold
man.
"You will when you're stung," ad
vised Sledge.
"I'm uot stung," announced Coldman
emphatically. "Our people don't take a
chance on getting in wrong. That
check can lie stopped."
"Go to it." ordered Sledge and punch
ed the bell. "Where's Bendix?" he de
mantled of Adolph.
"Don't know. Want him?"
"Quick!" ordered Sledge. "Why
didn't you tell me you was after con
trol? Now you don't get anything."
"I get out—that's one cinch!" stated
Coldman. rising and looking at Ids
watch.
"How?" askijjJ Sledge.
"That's my affair. I d be a sucker to
lay myself liable by an admission of
the knowledge."
"1 want to know," persisted Sledge.
"1 want to be sure of it." i
"You're gunning for Marley," sur
mised Coldman.
"Sure 1 am!" agreed Sledge. "1 don't
want you stnng. IIuw do you crawl?"
"Do 1 get back iu after It's all
straightened out?"
"You can have a chunk of IL"
Coldman surveyed him thoughtfully.
"They do say you stick to a promise
like that," he mused. "Well, two
weeks ago I had a written authority
to make contracts, conclude business
and write checks, in the name of my
corporation. Day before yesterday
that authority was revoked. We al
ways do that."
Bendix came In.
"Marley got out from under," Sledge
told him. "Why?"
"So the wedding could come off,"
returned Bendix, with an Involuntary
glance at the red rose boutonniere.
"The wedding!" repeated Sledge.
"Look here, Bendix, don't you kid
me!"
"i wish I was," replied Bendix.
showing, for the first time, his knowl
edge of how important all this was to
the big boy. "Molly and Bert Glider
are to be married right off the Imt."
No man had ever seen Sledge pale
before.
"When?" he wheezed.
"Right away. This afternoon!
They're being married now!"
Although there were to be no guests
it the Marley wedding, the house was
naturally in a state of much tensity as
the time approached. Molly, for two
hours before the minister was to ar
rive, was engaged fn the finishing
touches of her toilet which was fully
as elaborate, though not so conven
tional, as if the function was to be
the most formal one possible, and her
boudoir, from one end to the other,
was clattered with fluffy Query, with
toilet accessories, with two maids and
Fern Burbaus, the three latter articles
being in a state closely bordering on
hysteria.
Downstairs Bert Glider wandered
from room to room feeling more iu the
way than if he were an unbidden guest
at somebody cise's wedding, his only
human comp.anion being an occasional
contact with the thin legged butler,
who. under the excitement of Uie occa
sion. had opened a surreptitious bot
tle of champagne in the pantry, and,
there bclug plenty of room in his in
tellect, had succumbed to the inevita
ble gloom of the occasion.
The most busily occupied one of all,
however, was Frank -Marley, who.
from immediately after breakfast, had
ensconced himself in his den, where
he somewhat sadly finished his con
nection with many odds and ends of
local business and social institutions,
writing checks and friendly notes all
the morning.
He even had his lunch brought In to
him, for, truth to tell, lie preferred
rather to be alone than to be with
Bert on this particular day. lie felt
somehow as if be could never be quite

"Right away. -This afternoon! They're
being married now!"
in accord with the man who was to
take from him his motherless Molly,
and he tried to quell the fear for her
which arose in him. Moreover, Bert
represented the new life which stretch
ed before him, and be was not quite
ready for it now that the time had
come. He was an old man, he real
ized, and it is a dangerous matter to
uproot old trees. He had lived the
best years of his life in this city, had
worked here, and had married here,
and had built up his fortunes here, aud
here had occupied a position of some
honor and respect. And, try as he
would, he could not look with too
much confidence upon achieving the
same thing as a stranger in a strange
place.
It was all wrong, he told hlinself,
and be would not even be properly
thankful for the crumb of luck which
ho had wrested from the bygone feast.
In his pocket he had the check which
removed him from the nerve racking
fluctuations of his street car fortuues,
which insured Molly and Bert and
himself an entrance into a new life
and new opportunities, which made
him safe from Sledge, and yet lie felt
no great exultation.
It was a relief to him when Molly
had him called to look at her where
she stood at the head of the stairs in
her bridal gown, a fresh and glowing
vision in her pure, shimmering white.
The sight of her gave him a thrill of
hopefulness too, the first of the day.
"You're a. beauty, Molly," he called
up to her. "I declare, I don't see how
Î have been lucky enough to keep you
with me so long as this."
"That's a nice daddy." she gayly as
sured him.
Bert came in from the conservatory
for the glimpse of her which he was
to be permitted, and naturally he
spoiled the picture by starting to dart
upstairs, an action which had the re
sult of sending uot only Molly and
Fern, but the admiring maids scurry
ing back to the boudoir, the door of
which sacred apartment they locked
and bolted and would have barred had
*here been any means to do so. Bert,
quite properly defeated, came back
down the stairs and joined Marley.
"A bridegroom doesn't, amount to
much anyhow," lie conventionally ad
mitted.
"And a husband to less," supplement
ed Marley. "You'll discover by aud
by, my boy. that the lords of creation'
are only lords by proxy."
"You're trying to scare me," protest
ed Bert.
"No, only to encourage you," insisted
Marley. "The happiest man in the
world Is one who finds a wife capable
ef directing him and generous enough
to let him think he is doing It all him
sslf."
"That's a new idea to me," pondered
Bert complacent through condescen
sion only ns he stroked his carefully
curled mustache and reflected upon his
own ability.
"The worst of it is you have to grow
o!d to realize it," Marley gently insin
uated. "I was a smart man until my
wife died! Won't you have a drink?"
"No. thanks." refused Bert, walking
disconsolately to the library. "I prom
ised Molly the minister shouldn't smell
it on my breath."
"Afterward, then," laughed Marley,
and, returning to his den, closed the
door just as the bell of his extension
telephone rang.
''Hello, Marley!" hailed the voice of
Willie Walters. "Had your franchise*
canceled and regranted ?"
"Don't need it" replied Marley, re
flecting instantly that he was out of
the franchise worry, but curious never
the less. "What do you mean?"
"The Allertou bill was put through
Its final passage last night." explained
Walters.
"Oh, yes, the Allerton bill," smiled
Marley. "I knew all about that"
"You don t seem to have got iu early
ou the advantages," remarked Walters,
securing a story. "It's a law now, op
erative from its passage."
"It wou't hurt auybody," chuckled
Marley. "There wasn't much of Im
portance in It."
"No?" queried Walters. "Just enough
to make a political corpse of Allerton.
They'll embroider that fifty year fran
chise clause on his shroud."
*Trauebise clause? I don't under
stand."
"1 thought you didn't know the pro
visions of the bill," went on Walters,
delighted to have unearthed a new na
gle to the story. "The thing is so
beautifully juggled that it automatical
ly extends all franchises granted with
in the last ten years to an extra fifty
years of lifetime on the same terms as
their original charter."
"Good!" returned Marley. "All my
franchises have been renewed within
the last ten years."
"Now I know you've been asleep," re
joiced Walters, not that he had any
enmity for Marley, but merely that ho
liked a good story. "The bill specifical
ly docs not apply to renewals, but to
original franchises. Why. yours abso
lutely expires iu three years, if that's
the case; moreover, the franchises at
the end of that time belong to Sledge's
company."
"Impossible!" gasped Marley.
"Get your alarm clock fixed," advis
ed Walters. "Monday night the coun
cil in secret session granted franchises
to Slcdgo's company covering every
street in the city, including—now, listen
—including those streets now covered
by franchises when those franchises
expire." . *
For Just a moment Marley felt the
strength leaving him, a spasmodic Im
pulse due to an entirely automatic men
tal impression that he still owued the
old. company. • - ■ *. ?
"It's a bald faced steal!" he hotly
charged, indignant at Sledge's whole
sale appropriation.
"It's a pippin!" agreed Walters.
"Fact of the matter is, Marley, that
unless you completed that consolida
tion with Sledge at the expiration of
three years he can make you tear up
your rolling stock aud other trash.
Did you consolidate?"
"No," laughed Marley, and for a mo
ment Walters professionally hoped that
he had been mentally unbalanced by
the news. "No, Walters," Marley
chuckled when lie had succeeded in
controlling his voice: "I didn't consoli
date. I sold out"
"On the level?" queried Walters in
credulously. "To whom? How much?
Did you get the cash?"
"I got the cash, but that's all I'll
auswer." laughed Marley. "I might
reveal somebody else's secrets if I
told you more," and despite the plead
ing of Walters lie refused to make an
other statement
He turned from the telephone, still
chuckling, but suddenly noticed that
his hand was trembling as if it bad
been palsied. His body seemed to
have realized before his mind the over
whelming disaster which he had es
caped.
Why. if ho had not sold out at the
exact minute he did his stock today
would he worse than worthless. Tho
entire company would not bring moro
than the junk heap value of its worn
out equipment. He could not have met
the mortgage on his house, ho could
not hove paid a dollar of his debts, lie
would have been left without a penny,
and he would have dragged down into
bankruptcy hundreds of poor families
like Henry Peters', who had their all
invested in his enterprise. True, they
were ruined anyhow or would be, but
he had a curiously unmoral sense that
by stepping out from under before tho
crash came and by being no longer at
(he head of the doomed company, lie
was passing along the moral responsi
bility of their downfall to the up state
syndicate and to Sledge. Thank God,
he was safe.
Again his bell rang.
"Marley?" queried n tense person.
"Yes," he acknowledged, trying to
place the voice ns that of some news
paper man of his acquaintance and
feeling again that comfortable sense of
escape.
"This is Coldman," rasped the voice.
"Say, Marley, we're in a pickle."
"What's the matter?" inquired Mar
ley, watching his right hand curiously.
It wabbled spasmodically where It lay
on the table, and he seemed to have
ho control over it
"Firm revoked my authority to act
two days ago. Just got their notifica
tion."
"Yes T queried Marley, with a
strange inability quite to grasp fJb-i
meaning of this.
"Well," went on Coldman, "I'm send
ing out your stock by a messenger boy.
You may as well tear up that check.
It's no good."
