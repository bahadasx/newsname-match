Tnke one of Stone's Silver Slice Cnkcs, split It lengthwise
and fill with full-ripe, lusciom bcrries-the result will be a

We linve tried it nnd find thnt Sliver Slice lends itself

flnvors blend nicely nnd the contrast of color is most plens--ing

AN INTERESTING YOUNGSTER
Mr. rranK Marksuury became very-
much interested In a boy eight years
old who stopped at his home Sun'day
morning to inquire how far he was
from town. His name was Edward
Earle Hays of Chattanooga, who is
visiting in Danville He had ildden
over earlier in the day with Mr. Kris-
tow Conn but says Mr. Conn brought
him so fast he could not see the town
and country and without the knowledge
or consent of his mother and aunt h
decided to try it on his wheel, which
he did making good time and a good
dinner at Mr. Marksbury's. Mr.
Marksbury 'had him telephone his
mother and later heard that he got
back to Danville safe and sound.
MORE BOYS FOR NAVY.
The preparedness program of Secre
tary of the Navy Daniels includes a
special examination for entrance to the
United States Naval Academy at An-
napolis which will open a naval career
ta two hundred young men in addition
to the number admitted to the academy
in normal times. This step ,!a taken to
secure an. adequate stall of officers to
man the ships provided by the new
naval building program.
When the recent act was passed in
creasing tho number of appointments
of each Senator and member of the
House of Representatives from two to
three, it was realiztd that little time
remained befoie the April examination
to permit of Senators and members of
the House to select young men to fill
the vacancies and at the same time al
low sufficient time for the candidates
to prepare for the examination, lly
holding another examination In July
advantage will be taken of the new Isw
to the fullest extent practicable to ac
complish its purpose of providing more
officers for the navy.
CHAUTAUQUA A SUCCCESS.
The Itedpath Chautauqua which held
forth in Lancaster.for live days, clos
ing last night was a great success in
every way, the interest and attendance
being unsurpassed. The talent em
ployed wat up to the high standard of
the previous Chautauquas and each day
was an improvement on the preceeding
dy. For the first time the guarantors
lost nothing and a Chautauqua for next
year was easily gotten up.
The entire local management made
many friends while In our city and it
is the unanimous choice that every one
of them be returned next year. Mr.
llendrtckson, the superintendent in
charge, who was with us two years
ago, is exactly the right man for the
place and while it was their first trip
here, W. J. S cott, the cashier, E. M,
VMIs, the electrician and C. Tf Ket
cham, the property man, all were o-
lite and courteous and did their work
systematically and well.
The Mother Goose pageant under the
directorship of Miss McCormick was
well rendered and showed much train
ing and care. Her stories to the child
ren were all enjoyed, both by the
young as well as the grown ups.
COUNTY SUNDAY
SCHOOL CONVENTION.
The County Sunday School Convention
will bo held-this ye ir at Hyattsville on
Saturday, June 16th, In the Hyattsville
Chapel. The morning session begins
promptly at 10 o'clock. All church
workers are earnestly requested to be
present.
MORE PAY FOR
R. D. CARRIERS.
It will be of interest to all rural car
riers in Kentucky to learn that tho
senate committee on postofllces and
ostcards has just voted into the post
office appropriation bill a provision un
der which each of the 42,000 rural mail
carriers in the United States will re
ceive the $10O increase In salary which
they failed to get last year because of
the Inability of congress to agree on
the postoffice bill. If this action
stands the $100 will be a permanent
addition to each carricis salary.
HARMONY WANTED AT
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
The Republican National convention
at 11 o'clock ystrrday with Senator
Warren G. Harding In the chair as Its
temporary chairman. The matter of
making a nomination will probably be
taken up to-day or perhaps not until
to-morrow. If Justice Hughes is nom-
ineted for the'J'residency it looks as if
(Tol. Roosevelt will run as a progress
ive as he did four vears ago. Roose
velt seems to have all. the noise, but
when it comes to the vote it looks like
Hughes is there with the goods.
If the nomination goes to a dark
horse, it looks like Senator Harding
has a cinch on it. The platform will
spell Americanism, preparedness, pro
tection and prosperity.
ENGLAND' MOURNS LOSS OF
KITCHENER AND EN
TIRECTAFF. The news that Earl Kitchener, Sec
retary of State of War. and his statt.
who were proceeding to Russia aboard
the cruiser Hampshire, were lost oil
the Orkney Island Monday night, was
the most stunning blow Great Brittain
has received since the war began.
Admiral Jellicoe's report to the Ad
miralty was as follows:
I have to report with deep regret
that his Majesty's ship Hampshire,
Cant. Herbert J- Savill, R. N With
Lord Litchener and his stall on board,
was sunk last night about 3 o'clock
to the west of the Orkneys, eitligr bv
a mine or a torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observers
on-shore to leave the ship. The wind
was north-'northwest and heavy seas
were running. Patrol Vessels and de
stroyers at once proceeded to the spot
and a party was sent along the coast
to search but only some bodies and a
capsized boat have been found up
to the present. As the whole shore
has been searched frbm the seaward, I
greatly fear that there is little hope
of there being any survivors.
No report has yet been received
from the search party on shore. II. M
S. Hampshire was on her way to Russia."

MRS RELLA ARNOLD FRANCIS. 1
The oldest and only framo store
building on the public square and known
as the old Marrs corner was totally
destroyed by fire from an unknown
origin, about three-thirty o'clock Wed
nesday morning. Tho building was
owned by Mr. R. II. Tomlinson, of this
city, who purchased it many years Bgo
from the estate of the late Stephen
Matrs, and was estimated to huve been
built about one hundred years ago. Mr.
Tomlinson carried no insurance and his
loss Is a total one and. estimated at
about $1, 000. The building waa oc
cupied by W. A. Jones as a meat mar
ket and grocery and his loss is total,
aggregating about $1,500, with $800
insurance. The 1'uritan building own
ed by Mr. V. T. West, was damaged
about $300 and but for the prompt as
sistance and response of the local fire
department'his loss would have been
serious.
The fire department did some splen
did work and was congratulated by
many for its efficient services in get
ting the fire under control after the
headway it had gotten before the alarm
was turned in from the hotel Kengar-
Ian, which was first discovered by one
of the occupants. Only a slight damage
was done the Puritan, by water, but It
looked at one time as if the whole
building would be destroyed. The den
tal apartments of Dr. H. l Walter,
was considerably damaged aa was the
furniture of the Sanders Mercantile Co,
The lots to each of these firms will be
several hundred dollars, with no insur
ance. Mr. West's loss is covered by
Insurance. The building adjoining the
grocery, owned by Mr. J. M. Logan,
of New York City, was unscathed saved
by pie breaking of two of the front
windows from the heat.
Mr. Tomlinson informs us that he
will erect immediately on the old site,
a handsome brick building, with store
rooms below and offices above.
