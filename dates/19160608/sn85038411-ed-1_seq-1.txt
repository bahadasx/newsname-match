Speeches; Justice Hughes Is Gaining Strength
Rapidly; Resolutions Comittee Endorses Principle of
Woman Suffrage
Coliseum, Chicago, June 8. —At 1.31 o'clock the Republican
National Convention recessed until 4 P. M., (5 o'clock Harrisburg
time), to await the report of the Resolutions Committee which still
was working on the platform.
The convention was in session about two hours and did nothing
more than perfect its permanent organization and listen to some
speeches
Dissenting reports on the woman suffrage and Mexican planks
have been carried to the full committee by the sub-committee and
the convention was forced to wait while the committee discussed
these measures and debated adoption of a prohibition plank.
Chauncey M. Depew was called to the platform for a "minute
speech" and when he had concluded, former Speaker Cannon was
introduced, the managers trying to occupy the delegates until the
Resolutions Committee was ready.
As political leaders gathered for i
the second day's sessions of the Re
publican and Progressive National
Conventions it became more and
more apparent that there would be
two tickets in the field. Victor Mur
dock chairman of the Progressive Na
tional Committee, summed up the
■whole situation when he said to
day:
"Well, we left the door open, and
the Republicans don't seem to be com - i
lng in."
That was the Progressive leader's
reply to inquiries as to whether there
remained any prospect for harmony
nnd whether there was likely to be
appointed to-day conference commit
tees representing both parties to re
reive and pass upon peace suggestions.
Republican leaders too, discounted
the success of the peace talk, saying
that action had been delayed for so
lons that a majority of the Republi
can delegates already have decided to
proceed without regard for any third
party, and nominate Justice Hughes,
to whom the most support has been
gathered

There are some among the Pro
gressives and among Roosevelt Re
publicans as well, who still believe
lhat the Colonel himself coud have
the day if he would come to Chicago.
Representative Gardner of Massa
chusetts, who was defeated for Re
publican delegate-at-large from
Massachusetts on a Roosevelt ticket,
pleaded with Progressive leaders to
bring Colonel Roosevelt on without
delay. Word came from Oyster Bay.

Pennsylvania delegates—those Senator Penrose did not capture—under his control. He himself is a candidate for

May Arbitrate Differences
Between U. S. and Mexico
By Associated Press
Washington, June 8. Arbitration
of differences between the United
States and Mexico through an inter
j national commission to-day became a
possibility.
Diplomats, particularly those of
Central and South American republics,
were much interested in information
that administration officials are con
[ siderinp seriously proposing such a
course to General Carranza. If they
definitely decide to suggest this, it
would be sent as the United States'
answer to Carranssa's last note. Ac
ceptance would then depend on the
de facto government.
Under the treaty of 1848 between
the United States and Mexico the
presidents of the two nations might
appoint an equal number of commis
sioners to whom could be submitted
all the vexatious questions arising out
of relations between the two coun
tries the past few years.
