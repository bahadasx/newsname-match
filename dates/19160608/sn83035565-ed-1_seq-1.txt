Democratic Revenue
Law a Failure.
Washington, June 7. (Special
Correspondence. ) Democ ratic
leaders in Washington are much
chagrined at the speech delivered
recently by Senator Furnifold
Simmon before the Democratic
State Committee at Raleigh,
North Carolina. .
Senator Simmons' speech was
looked forward to with a great
deal of confidence by the Demo
crat3, because it was expected to
be the only genuine simon-pure
keynote speech of the party for
the 1916 campaign. There will
be a so-called key-note speech de
livered at St. Louis by Mart
Glynn, but remembering his fu-
... tile attempt to answer Elihu
Roct, the Democrats had pinned
small confidence on Glynn's St.
Louis peroration. With the faint
hope stirring in their bosoms that
the Democratic party will fatten
at the public trough for the next
four years, and realizing the fact
that the Hon. Furnifold Simmons
might continue as the chairman
of the Finance committee, the
committee which, when it comes
to a showdown, dictates the fis
cal policy of this country, the
Democrats had faith that Mr.
Simmons' speech would so man
ipulate statistics and language
that the country would feel suffi
ciently assured to place one more
bet on the disciples of Woodrow
- Wilson.
Little consolation do they find
in the Raleigh speech Simmons
is as uncompromising a free tra
der as ever. The panorama of
future trade offers no terrors for
Furnifold. Wilson has relented
to the extent of espousing a tar
iff commission, because of "chan
ging conditions ;" the Democrats,
generally, believe that a revision
of the tariff, on the plea of "ad
ditional revenue," is advisable,
but Simmons, -having swatted
business with an axe, pleads
"guilty" and looks to the coun
try for vindication. This un
compromising attitude .of the
chairman of the Finance commit
tee will embarrass Woodrow Wil
son in making concessions to the
November voters. . How can the
leader of the party 'declare for ' a
new tariff bill, wh,erT the chair
man of the' Seriate committee,'
who is largely responsible for
the present law, presents a brief
in. its favor?
One of the worst breaks of
Senator 4 Simmons in presenting
his tariff argument to the North
Carolina Democratic State Con
vention is to be found in the fol
lowing contradiction :
"You cannot revise the tariff
in the interest of the people un
less you lower the wall enough to
let the foreigner over unless you
write it low enough to allow com
petition from abroad, when the
price here is above the level of a
fair and just profit! That is what
we aimed to do, and I think have
done." . ' 1, ; ;::,-
. Then, flying to the defense of
, the present law he says v ' There
was some increase in bur total
imports during the year imme
diately preceding the war, just
as there had been a constantly
continuing increase in our im
ports both under the Dingley
tariff and the Payne-Aldrich tar
iff, but the ratio of increase in
our total, as of our free imports
under the Democratic tariff, were,
during that period, no greater,
indeed, not so great, as the aver
age annual increase under the
Payne-Aldrich tariff during its
whole life. Indeed, our imports
for that year were $120,000,000
less than I estimated when I, as
chairman of the Finance commit
tee, reported the bill to the Sen
ate in 1913."
Democrats point out that this
t
is a further confession of failure
of the Underwood-Simmons law.
If the bill did not encourage im
ports, as Simmons declares it did
not, then the Democratic tariff
theory goes to the discard, and
what is the use of giving public
ity to its failure? The people
know that the law was a failure
as a revenue producer, that it did
cause business depression, and
now Simmons has robbed the free
i
traders of their last argument in
favor of the Democratic law by
declaring it was not an encour
ager of imports, a f alsehood which
the party is estopped to deny.
Altogether, Senator Simmons has
got himself in "dutch, and will
probably keep quitt the rest of
the year.

Gettysburg.
All eyes are now directed to v-
ard Chicago. So far results are
conjectural. Mo one knows what
will issue from the conventions
in prospect Nothing is ventured
by saying the first one held is in
tended to influence the action of
the second one, but to what ex
tent cannot now be told. I trow
it will not be to the extent claim
ed by some. Of course, it is, as
is said, the wish is father to the
thought. The zealous j. R.ite
wishes that the first convention
nominate T. R., and when that is
done then have the second con
vention endorse that nomination
and thus unite all factions in one
integral whole. This seems very
much in accord with the wish of
the progressive faction of the Re
publican party that flew off like
a tangent four years ago. Will
it be dont? If the Republican
party desires to organize defeat
it may he done, and the Demo
cratic nominee, who will be the
present incumbent' in the presi
dential chair, will be elected for
another term of office. In the
present contest there is some
thing riiore important than to
minister to the whims of T. R.
Our country is full of statesmen
very far "ahead of anything pos
sessed by this agitator, whose on
ly principle is" me and mine, and
cares for nothing more than su-
premacy. bo ne is nonorea ana
given power he cares for nothing
more. Let me say, T. R has
been honored beyond his merits
and here it ought to stop. The
country has had more of his type
of statesmanship than has been
for its good, and it is now time
to pass him up and let some more
worthy and capable statesman
lead the country to heights of
happiness and prosperity. There
never was a time when real states
manship was more in need than
just now. Ebulitions and hot
wind may be rightfully relegated
to the rear and men of right poise
ought to be given the helm to
guide the Ship of State.

The Planets for June.
Venus will continue for some
time to be a conspicuous object
in the western sky. She is now
situated a little north of Saturn
and a little below the twin sis
ters, Castor and Pollux. Mars is
still visible, though on account of
its increasing distance from the
earth, it is becoming very faint,
It is close to the bright star, Reg
ulaa. Jupiter is still too near the
siin'to be visible.' On June 21, 6
o'clock p.m., the Isun enters Can
cer and summer begins.
The principal ijxed stars visi
ble during the mdnth are Castor
and Pollux in the northwest, Arc
turus to the west, Antares to the

Fashionable Color
Schemes.
Notwithstanding the shortage
of dyes proclaimed on every side,
the dress color scheme has sel
dom been more gorgeous than
this season. Especially are the
smaller accessories produced in
hues that make a tropical bird's
plumage seem drab.
Color Contrasts.
Apparently there is no limit to
the combinations of colors, and
while the primary tones of yellow
and purple, red and green, blue
and lilac, and mixtures of all of
these, and even more shrieking
tones, are distinctly shocking in
the shops, they go very well in
the open against the verdure of
turf and foliage, under blue skies
that put any artificial coloring in
the shade.
Blouses' and Tops.
Blouses for any purpose almost
are made up of thinnest voi'er,
crepes, organdies or nets, and de
pend more than ever on the cam
isole beneath. This latter gar
ment in flesh color or white, in
form like a girdle with straps ov-
er the shoulders, has come to b
an indispensable part of the out-
McCall Designs
fit, and on it are lavished all the
elaborations of lace, ribbons and
whatnots, formerly seen on the
blouse itself, and now veiled by
its dainty sheerness in most at
tractive fashion. Even with the
quietest, most demure of little
coat and skirt suits, blouses of
all the pinks from flesh to deep
watermelon tones, are worn,
while blues in turquoise, pea
cocks, King's and cobalt tones
are reckoned especially smart
with black. Yellows, no matter
how pronounced, from - straw
to sulphur, and greens, . espec
ially in the tilleul and citron tones
that suggest metal, arejespecially
modish both for garments and as
a trimming note in the costume.
Vogue of Organdie.
Some of the handsomest French
gowns that have come in recent
ly, are built r f organdie, with
garnitures and designing, that
takes them a long way out of the
class of wash frocks with which
this fabric is associated. A dress
of rose-organdie, has a deep hero.
of black chantilly lace on the
skirt, topped with an entire deux
of narrower lace, which trim
I1 mine also outlines the front
breadth apron' f a a h i o n and
111
forms a long oblong on the sim
ply fashioned blouse. The sleaves
end at the elbow finished with
wide ruffles of black chantilly, and
a wide upstanding collar of this
lace ends in front with a small
jabot. Another organdie dress
by Cheruit, is cream colored e
laborately embroidered in a coral
pattern with silver thread. Worn
over a chiffon skirt that tops an
other of tulle and a third of chif
fon lace-trimmed this dress is
as ethereal as a cloud.
White organdie frilled with
brown tulle in quaint festoons,
with a fichu bodice, is novel in
treatment, and a mauve organdie
with white collar and sleeve cuffs,
the belt of dark blue and citron
ribbon fastening with one blue
and one yellow rose, is a decid
edly French conception.
A Novel Blouse.
The newest thing in blouses
suggests a middy motive, siiice it
siips on over the head by a deep
V opening, and is . guiltless of
buttons or other fasteners. Noth
ing could be easier to make or
more easily laundered in the blue
and white striped cotton that
makes if, with only a frill of Val
enciennes trimming the cuff and
collar.

Law Benefits Slate.
SPREADS THE NEWS IN OHIO
Frotperity More General Than Ever
Before and Work and Money Plen
tiful Denver Savee Nearly Half
Million Dollar a Month On Boor
Bill Prohibition Mere Popular Now
Than When Adopted by Voters.
Columbus. O. (Special.) Indus
trial Commissioner Williams of Col
c.'ado was in Columbus recently at
tending ti.s national convention of the
state industrial cominisuion boards.
In an address before the convention
regarding recent strikes in his slate.
Mr. Williams explained how prohibi
tion had aided in the settlement of
these strikes. The passions o. the
rjen were not inflamed by drink, there
Has less v'olence. and arbitration was
nade easier and mord satisfactory. ,
Mr. Williams asserts that prohibi
tion Is exceedingly popular In Col
tiado, as the state h? now more pros
perous than at any time during the
ears the licensed saloons were in
cperation. Banks are full of money,
there is plenty of work for everybody
ei d good wajres, and the men are buy
Iv.g liberally of comforts and luxuries,
i ttead or wasting millions of dollars
each year over saloon bars.
Under the prohibition law of Col
orado packages of liquor shipped into
the state must he accounted for and
i record filed with the secretary ot
state by the railroads. During the
month of March railroads reported
f ,186 packages of liquor shipped into
the city of Denver, the value of the
liquor so Imported beins $50,000.
Prior to Colorado becoming dry Den
ver had 4fiu licensed saloons and sev
eral hundred other places, aside fi'om
drug stores, which held internal rev
enue receipts.
It Is 'estimated that when Denver
Pad her 465 saloons her liquor hill
.as $6,000,000 a year, or $500,000 a
month. As the March Importations
of liquor, according to the otlicla!
records, were but $50,000, Denver In
that one month saved $450,000, which
under the license system would have
been spent, for booze.
The liquor press is trying to make
capital out of the amount of Intox-
kants now being shipped into Denver,
'tut these official records show that
this amount is but a drop in the
tucket compared with the volume of
liquor sold in that city when saloons
were permitted.
Mr. Williams . says many former
liquor dealers are making good in
other lines of business and expressed
themselves as being glad they are not
selling liquor. Those who wanted to
keep on selling intoxicants have mov
ed to other states, and with them
have gone the thugs, gamblers and
that undesirable element which Is a
detriment to the state.
There 13 some talk on the part of
the old liquor crowd about resubmit
t'ng prohibition at the coming elec
t'on this year. Mr. Williams is of the
opinion that if this is done Colorado
will roll up a much heavier dry ma
jority than when she last voted.
THEY WANT THE MONEY
Philadelphia Judge Gives Estimate of
the Liquor Dealers.
Philadelphia. Pa (Special.) Judge
Davis of the liquor license court of
ttis city has taken the measure of
the saloonkeepers and, after distribut
ing licenses and hearing protests, the
judge says in the Ledger:
'These liquor dealers are very anx
ious to got liquor licenses. They
want the money that is all they
v.ant. They do not consider whosh
home they are wrecking, or whoso
mothers' hearts they are breaking. It
is the gain they are after. It is their
job to get all the money they can and
then kick the fellow into the gutter.
Law Not Observed.

.the first three months of 1916 there
'were 625 arrests in Steubenville, and
of this number the records ishow that
more than 500 of these arrests were

Ohio license law prohibits the sale
of liquor to drunkards. Evidently
this law is not being observed by the
