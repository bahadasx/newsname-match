"second In the world In tattle effl

cltlsea military trainingsupplied and
controlled -by' the federal govern
wont, the progressive pisiform adopt
ed today makes preparedness and
Americanism the keynotes of party
policy. j
Standing for peace, the progres
sives declare that an adequate mili
tary establishment tor defense, suffi
cient to guarantee American rights
on land and sea and to uphold the
honor of the nation, Is a basic duty
of the government to the people. ..
Linked with their declaration for a
stronger military establishment, the
progressives assert that Individual
efficiency, a "passing of prosperity
about," and a social Justice are Im
perative. Regulation of Industry and
a non-partisan tariff commission are
declared essential to meet with the
mobllUed production of Europe fol
lowing the war., .

Chicago, Jane 8 (1:15 p. m.).-
Every outward alga and every obtain- '
able statement from opposing lead
ers indicated a hopeless deadlock ot
the political situation at' this hour.
The republican convention, held la
perfect control by its leaders, waa as
far from the eelecUoa ot a candidal
as at the hour of opening yesterday. :
It had admittedly reached aa Irapaaa
and was awaiting the next move ot
the progressives. ; h
The bull noose convention, divided
within Itself, and apparently entirely
out of the control of Us leaden, was
momentarily expected to break the
leash held by George W. Perkins, and
to proceed with the nomination of
Theodore Roosevelt At thla hour
Perkins was still talking hopefully ot
harmony. , The old guard leaders fee
Hered no harmony , was possiUe lt
it existed In accepting Roosevelt.
Justice Hughes still loomed a the
most' likely nominee of the republi
cans, but will only hold this place eo
long as there is a chance of his nom
ination drawing the progressives back
into the ranks. The Justice is scarce
ly more popular with the leaders than
T. R. ' His steadfast refusal to pull
the situation ont of the fire, aa It la
figured he might, Is causing him to
be charged with responsibility tor the
deadlock.;' , ; ,rv ':... v t
At the same time Hughes can have
the nomination for a nod If he will
only nod so the progressives, as welt
as the republicans, can see him.
. Roosevelt's statement that he Is
twilling to. come to Chicago It request
ed by the republicans, has resulted la
no mad summons! . The colonel's bid
tor an Invitation is claiming the at
tention of the leaders this afternoon.
That is all It la likely to do. Unless
the colonel cares to let lt be known'
before band what he will say If given
the privilege to address the conven
tion, he will not be Invited. .
