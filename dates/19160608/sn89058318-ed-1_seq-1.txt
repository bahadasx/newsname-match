The once famous Cumberland
Hotel was discovered "on nra.at!
Monteagle, last Sunday night
about 10 o'clock, by some of the
citizens there and before they
could save anything it was re
duced to ashes. It was the pro
perty of a fellow by the name of
Mr Williams, but had been
vacant for some time, as it only
run in tfie summer time. Mr.
Williams carried a good deal of
insurance on this building and 1
guess wanted some ready cash
and thought that' by burning the
building he would get the insur
ance. He hired a car in Chatta
nooga Sunday evening about 3
o'clock and started for Monteagle
on his desperate mission. Arriv
ing in Monteagle that night he
told his chaffeur to wait for him
at the corner bv the Fairmont
College as he had a little busi
ness to attend to, and was gone
about 15 minutes and returning
to his car, told his chaffeuf . to
drive for Chattanooga, but" alas
for him when they had gotten
some distance out of Monteagle
the car broke down. Mr. Schild
and Anderegg who had been
summoned to Monteagle to cut
the electric wires away from the
burning building passed them on
the road, and asked them if they
needed any assistance and tlfey
hid their face behind their hands
and said no. Schild and Ander
egg drove on to Monteagle and
told Mr. Brosi Marugg and Mar
vin Henley about seeing the car,
they proceeded to. go and investi
gate, and coming up to where the
car was, asked the occupant fof
the car if his name wasn't Wil
liams, and he said, no his name
was Johnson, and he was from
Nashville. So this still aroused
Brosis' curiosity, as he knew Mr.
Williams wlien he was summer
ing in Monteagle. Brosi got
busy and Sheriff Hamby
was 'summoned, and pro
ceeded to place Williams and his
chaffeur under arrest and after
giving the chaffeur the third de
gree he told all about it.
Mr. Williams was tried before
Esq. Tidman Monday and bound
over to court under $2,500 bail
and to yet hasn't made it.

Larger postal savings deposits
will now be accepted at the post
office. This is made possible, by
an important amendment to the
Postal Savings Act just approved
by President Wilson. A postal
savings depositor may now have
tin account amounting to $1,000
upon which interest will be paid,
Formerly $500 was the maximum
amount he .could have to his cre
dit. This enlargement of postal
savings faeilites will be very gra
tifying to thousands of depositors
who have already reached the old
$500 limit and are anxious to en
trust more of their savings to
Uncle Sam. Another feature of
the amendment that will avoid
further embarrassment to the
public and to postal officials is
the doing away with the limit on
the amount that could be accept
ed from a depositor monthly,
Under the old law only $100 could
be deposited in a calender month.
The amendment abolishes this
restriction, While the Postal
Savings System has already pro
ved a signal success as is shown
by the fact that more than half-a-milliari
depositors have' over
eighty million dollars : standing
to their credit, still it has fallen
short of meeting the full demands
of the public because of the res
trictions which have now. been
eliminated. Postmaster Gener
al Burleson and Third Assistant
Postm aster General Dockery
have been tireless in their efforts
to secure a modification of the
limitations and the new liberaliz
ing legislation is particularly
gratifying to them.
