Chauncey Jokes on 60th Anni
versary in Politics.
(BY PERRY ARNOLD.)
Coliseum, Chicago, June 8. The
Republican national convention mark
ed time today, awaiting Us platform
framers report. In tne marking time
process, the delegates were . eated to
a session of oratory by such old time
wliec: horses of the party as Chauncey
W. Dt pew and L'ncle Joe Cannon with
Senator William E. Borah of Idaho
thrown in for good measure. If the
plc.ns of the G. O. P. leaders go
through as per schedule on which
were arranging things in the early
afternoon the session beginning at 4
p. fn., to which hour the conclave ad
journed at 1:31, will be a two or three
hour discussion of thj platform. It
was at first reported all over the hall
that a scheme was being fathered by
a number of the Old Guard to con
tinue the session through until eve
ning. Start 22 Minutes Iate.
Under skies that poured rain un
ceasingly the Republican national con
vention be;-?in its second day's session
at ll:l!2 twenty-two minutes behind
time. Although weather conditions
were identical with those of yesterday
th;erewas a noticeable warming.
Today the hnll was more nearly
filled when Temporary Chairman
Harding's gavel fell, only a few .eats
being vacant in the topmost galleries.
More women were on hand and there
by lent color to the scene. The nand
played more lively airs and there were
several faint outbursts, indicating
more "pep' everywhere.
More "Pep" Develops.
The program today was mostly rou
tine. But it was apparent most of the
delegates wanted to break forth when
something worth yelling about came
up- The resolutions committee ex
pected to make a report of its plat
form draft this afternoon, furnishing
the only spot development expected.
The convention had not been in ses
sion fifteen minutes when the new
"pep" showed in a really spontaneous
and prolonged demonstration for Sen
ator Harding when he was chosen per
manent chairman.
The cheers and applause continued
five minutes, although Harding strove
to stop it by frequent pounding of his
gavel. The report of the credentials
committee passed sailingly and the
session then turned to the work of
permanent organization.
m William Hahn of Ohio reported the
organization committee recommenda
tion to make the temporary organiza
tion permanent and this was adopted.
Then came the cheering.
Harding Tries to Stop Cheers.
After jockeying for position, the
crowd worked up to the point of aris
ing in spots and cheering enthusi
astically. Harding stood modestly smiling,
banging his gavel on the two inch oak
plank and striving to head off his
friends.
"It is a very great honor," said
Harding in accepting his new job.
"I'm a believer in the keeping of com
pacts and it was insisted if I were
mad e p e r m an e n t c hair man that I
would not make a speech and I'm
going to keep that compact.
"The chair calls for a report from
the committee on rules and order of
business."
The committee on rules was not
not ready at once to report and so the
convention marked time while the
band contributed some catchy strains.
Applaud for Smoot
Senator Smoot appeared and so re
ported, being given a round of ap
plause as iie appeared under the
sounding board.
Senator Smoot, chairman of the cre
dentials committee, offered a supple
mental report, giving the two delegates
from Hawaii. Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines votes in the convention as rec
ommended by the national committee.
It was adopted by acclamation.
It was noon when Chairman Warren
of the rules committee hustled on the
platform with his report. He read the
long formal report outlining the rules

NOMINATION. AT ANY TIME
Air of Suppressed Excitement
in Auditorium Today.
Raymond Robins Selected as
Permanent Chairman.
(BY H. I- REXNICK.)
Auditorium, Chicago, June 8. De
spite Colonel Roosevelt's statement of
fering to address the Republican con
vention and making another plea fot
harmony, the radical Bull Moose an
nounced this afternoon that they wer
going ahead with their plan to norr.
nate Roosevelt before the close of th
afternoon'e session of the Frogressiv
convention.
When shown Roosevelt's statemei
William Alien White, Kansas radic.
leader, told the meeting of the res
lutions committee for a conferei
with Chairman -Murdoch.
.-"The statement is to the Repub
cans. It is their funeral. .We are
ing ahead- with our plans. 1 thir
Roosevelt will be nominated this af
ernoon," he said.
Murdock although declining to b
quoted, intimated that he felt the sam
way about it
Robins Chairman.
The Progressive permanent organ
ization committee reported this after
noon, recommending the temporar;
organization with Raymond Robins b'
made permanent. This was a blow t
the Perkins adherents who wished t
make Walter Brown of .Ohio, a con
servative, permanent chairman.
Air of Excitement.
As the Progressive plans began to
trickle into the auditorium this af
ternoon there was a suppressed air
of tense excitement.
The radicals had agreed on a do or
die program. Some of them were In
clined to believe that Roosevelt's
statement was secured through the ef
forts of Geo. W. Perkins, leader of
the conservatives, in a final effort to
prevent a stampede for the colonel to
day. Immediate Nomination.
Some of the Progressive leaders, in
cluding Chairman Murdock of the na
tional committee, were seriously con
sidering immediate nomination today
or colonel Roosevelt. Mr. Murdock
was quoted as saying it might be "too
late tomorrow.
Ready for a Stampede.
The radical faction was primed to
start the stampede at the earliest mo
ment. A new singing club was re
hearsing Roosevelt songs.
"We won't go home till we nominate
Teddy but we'll nominate him today."
"It won't stop raining until we nom
inate Teddy so we'll nominate him to
day." This was their song.
Perkins, himself, tired and worn
after all night conferences with Pro
gressive radicals in an effort to con
vince them, he was a bit despondent of
his chance. For the first time Per
kins failed to deny that "Roosevelt
may be nominated today."
At 2:25 o'clock this afternoon it was
said that Parker agreed at Perkins's
solicitation to postpone Roosevelt's
nomination until tomorrow if possible
to control the delegates.
Gifford Pinchot, William Allen
White, H. L. Allen, darenge Dodge
and James A. Garfield of Ohio, were
in an earnest group, debating with
Parker.
They doubted that the delegates
could be held.
'I will make a statement to the dele
gates Immediately after they are call
ed to order," said Perkins, "that will
express my views. Mr. Parker wiU
follow me."
White of Kansas rushed up to
Parker and said:
"Don't change: go to It."
Parker apparently changed his
mind.
"All right, I will go to it," he said
and I will make the nominating
speech at five o clock.

Electrical Board Only One West
of the Mississippi.
The new electrical bulletin board,
the only one west of the Mississippi,
began informing the people of Topeka
of the latest news, from the front win
dow of the State Journal office, this
morning.
An ordinary typewriter is placed in
the telegraph editor's ' room on the
second floor and as fast as bulletins
from the leased Associated Press wire
are received in the room, the bulletins
are written on the typewriter. The
typewriter is placed on an . electric
keyboard, connected with the machine
in the front window.
As fast as the editor writes the
bulletins, a large wheel containing all
the letters of the alphabet, numbers
and characters necessary, forty-two in
all, begins revolving and prints the
proper letter on a constantly revolving
roll of paper.
As soon as one of the keys of the
typewriter has been pressed, the cur
rent is conveyed through a cable to an
electrical contact disc on the machine,
the contact being energized, conveys
the current to the selective magnets
on the index wheel. - These selective
magnets automatically lock the wheel,
in the right position, so that they
print the letter which is pressed on the
typewriter on the second floor of the
office. Instantly, then the mechanisms
are released for various other opera
tions. -

troops at that place have been ordered
to hold themselves in readiness to pro

The dispatch also says the French

Washington, June 8. Twelve hun
dred men of the Fifteenth infantry
under Col. Harry C. Hale, stationed in
Tien Tsin and along the railroad be
tween there and Peking, and a lega
tion guard of 330 marines constitute
the American military force in China.
It was said at the war department
Colonel Hale might take any part of
his force to Peking in an emergency
without instruction. He probably pre
pared to act as soon as he heard of
President Tuan Shi Kai's death.
State department advires from Peking
have indicated a remarkable quiescent
state of the Chinese public. The for
eign military commanders of the in
ternational guards in Peking nave
been in conference, regarding neces
sary military measures to deal with
oossible disorder in connection with
the influx into the legaton quarters
of large numbers of Chinese seeking
refuge.
The reports of movements of for
eign troops in China indicate appre
hension of disturbances following the
death of Yuan Shi KaL Direct dis
patches from China and Japan, how
ever, have given the impression that
notwithstanding the unsettled condi
tion of the last few months, no seri
ous disorders were expected. In fact
it was felt the death of the president
would have the result of ending the
revolution.
Tien Tsin is a treaty port about sev
enty miles southeast of Peking. There
is a smail American force in Tien Tsin
to guard the legation. There is also
a smail force in Peking.

the nation, is a basic duty of the gov

Linked with their declaration for a
stronger military establishment, the
Progressives assert that industrial ef
