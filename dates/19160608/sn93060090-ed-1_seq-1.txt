Desecrator of Flag
Severely punished
BOUCK WHITE IS FINED
$i.ooo And told America
IS NOPLACE FOR HIM.
New York, June 2 Bottck
White, paster of the Church of
the Social Revolution! who last
nigh L participated in the burn
lng of' the American flag and
otner national emblems in the
rear of his church, was today
found guilty by the coun of
special sossions of desecrating
the American emblem and was
sentenced to thirty days in the
penitentiary and to Day a tine
of $1, 000. The offense of whieh
tie was convicted today was in
the desecration of the American
ilag in circulars he caused to
he distributed some weeks ago.
Police Commissioner Woods
today ordered an investigation
of the burning last night of the
American flag: The affair was
described by White as ' the
birth of internationalism," It is
alleged the : American flag was
thrown to the flames by Albert
Hbnkel. described as an artist,
who afterward unfurled a ban
ner of "international industria
lly,, i'
Tbe circular upon which
White was convicted bore a car
toon representing the flag lying
blood soaked beneath an "Inter
national flag" and with dollar
signs in Ueu of stars. "I
admit the . distribution uf this
cartoon." White said- to the
court, "but it was 'only what I
bad a right to da under the fun
damental' privilege guaranteed
me by tbe constitution,' I yield
to no one in my respect for tho
noble things in "history that the
flag stands for. I bavu gone be
yond idealism and in this , car-
toon have mapped out a way in
which mankind can fellow and
institute on this earth the right
eouness for which God stand."
White was, asked if he had
not once said,:
"That flast no longer repre
sents idealism, but stands for
the vulgarist and greedest set of
profit grabbers since history
White admitted making this
remark whereupon Justice Mc
Inerny said;
"I think U you feel that way
about it you had better go and
rind some country of your own.
If you don't believe in Amer
iea and. Old Glory, you had bet
ter quit this country."
"Thank you for your sugges
tion." replied the defendant.
"Were you educated in Amer
ica? ' he was., asked.
"Yes at Harvard university, "'
answered .White.
The three justices of the court
found jWkite guilty without
leaving the bench and 'imposed
the 'maximum penalty. Justice
Moss announced that they re
gretted 'tbat the term specified
in the statutes is insufficient to
fit the oritae' and Justice Mc
Inerny added:
"There is no room in America
for men wno think and act as
you do.'", :,
From Wjcell in the Tombs
WEiteTater announced that his
case would be taken to the
higher courts providing funds
for his defense could be obtain
ed. - An investigation before Chief
Magistrate McAdoo into tbe flag
burning affair would be begun
