day of the republican national con
vention opened in a downpour of
rain, which visibly affected the spirit
of the delegates.
The second day's convention was
called to order at 11:22.
The temporary organization
immediately made permanent
Senator Harding was given an
was
and
ova-
tion.
The credentials committee report
was adopted and the Philippine, Ha
waiian and Porto Rican delegates
were seated.
The rules committee report was
adopted after a brief delay. Chaun
cey Depew was escorted to the plat
form, where he spoke for thirty min
utes. He was followed by Joe Cannon
who spoke for fourteen minutes. Sen
ator Borah then took the floor and
at the conclusion of his speech at
1:31 a recess was taken until four
o'clock to allow the resolutions com
mittee to finish its work.
Inasmuch as the temporary organ
ization was made permanent yester
day; nothing remained to be done
today but to report the proceedings
to the convention and asks its ap
proval. "Uncle Joe" Cannon was one of
the early arrivals today. He had
some trouble getting to the Illinois
delegation and a big policeman Due
through.
When called upon by Harding, Sen
ator Smoot read the report of the
credentials committee. He presented
a supplementary report by the cre
dentials committee, giving votes to
the six delegates from Hawaii, Poi'o
Rico and the Philippines. It was
adopted without opposition. That
made the total number of voes in
the convention 999, making 495 votes
necessary for the nomination.
The report of the rules committee
was then presented. The rules were
virtually those of the house of iep
resentatives. One prohibits a state

3lled Depev to
the platform. E. no yeai's eld,
this famous old N -w Yorker faced
the convention. His voice was still
full and round and carried better
than those of the younger men who
preceded him and he was given
close attention. Depew lauded reptc
lican diplomacy, asserting that the
"world always understood us up to
now." He brought laughter by re
ferring to President Wilson as "the
professor," and referred directly to
Bryan, who was in the press stand,
in commenting on the pacifists. The
general tone of his speech was for
national preparedness, and the con
vention approved it, urging him, af
ter he had spoken for seventeen min
utes and tried to stop, to "go on."
Harding next introduced former
Speaker Cannon as "Grand Old Uncle
Joe."
The resolutions committee voted
to include a plank endorsing suffrage
in principle and against including
prohibition.
The sub-committee of the repub
lican committee on resolutions adopt
ed a plank respecting the Mexican
relations offered by Fall of New Mex
ico, which is a strong attack on
the administration's policy. Other
ism. national defense and other ques.
tions have been adopted in a form
intended to meet the progressive
sentiment.
Hughes Gaining Strength.
The Hughes boom appears to be
gaining strength and it is predicted
by republican leaders that his nomi
nation will come enrlier than has
been predicted. These predictions
are said to be based on a careful
canvass of the delegates.
SAYS HE WILL GO TO CHICAGO
IF REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
DESIRES HIM TO ATTEND IT
MAKES REPLY.
Oyster Bay, June 8. Roosevelt will
come to Chicago "if the republican
convention desires me to address it."
This was his announcement today
in the reply he made to the invita
tion received last night from Senator
Jackson of Maryland, to come to
Chicago.
The colonel declared in his answer
that he hoped both the republicans
and progressives would nominate a
man who if elected would place the
nation "where it belongs by making
true to itself and therefore true to
all mankind."
Wilson, he said, rendered the most
evil "service that can be rendered to
a great democracy.
Returned from Tennessee.
J. R. Pennington has returned from
Memphis, Tenn., where he attended
the annual session of the Southern
Wholesale Grocery association. After
the session adjourned he visited at
Nashville and at his old home at
Lynchburg. He also made a trip to

nington, has spent the past year in

TWO ROOMING HOUSES AND
OTHER BUILDINGS DESTROYED
AT EARLY HOUR THIS MORN
ING CAUSE NOT KNOWN.
Ringling, Okla., June 8. Fire which
started from an unknown cause this
morning cleaned a quarter of a block
of the business and rooming house
district in this city. The area fire
swept is located on the west side of
the street leading from the railway
station to Main street. The total
loss is approximately $8,000, and it
is said that no insurance was car
ried. The blaze began in the Colson
rooming house and quickly spread,
owing to the class of buildings in
that section of the city. No person
was hurt, and immediately following
the alarm a large number of persons
were on hand to fight the flames.
Some of the smaller buildings were
razed to check the progress of the
flames, some were saved by the
bucket brigade which was very act
ive, and private fire extinguishers
were brought into action, and the
timely help saved the city Vrom
threatened destruction. Among the
buildings destroyed wvre Frank WilJ
man's drug store, which was a totiii
loss; the office of the Southern Land
company and the Ringling Saddlery
company. The latter company saved
a large part of its stock, but the
building was destroyed. Other build
ing's destroyed were the Colson rocm
ing house, where the fire started.
Ed Dowdy's rooming house, a res
taurant was destroyed, the building
in which it was located being owned
by Don Cochran. The flames did
not cross the alley hack of the town
site company's office at the corner
of Main and the street leading to
the station.
It is stated that the burned district
will be rebuilt and a better class
of houses will be constructed. The
buildings destroyed belong to that
class chiefly which are hurriedly
built in a new town, and while the
city regrets the losses to its property
owners, yet it is known that a series
of fires will be required to get the
pioneer buildings out of the way to
make room for the building of a
better and a greater city. Ringling
also congratulates itself upon the
timely work of the people of the
town who worked intelligently to
stop the flames.
Will Arrive Home Today.
Gomer Pennington, who has been
in Lebanon, Tenn., as a pupil in
Castle Heights school, is expected
home today. Gomer was In three
oratorical contests during the year,
and won first place in two of them.
He will bring home the gold medal
of his own school in declamation.
Here from Wilson.
John Lively, who has charge of the
C. P. Hall store at Wilson, is here
today. He came to see his father,
J. C. Lively, who is ill at his home
on F street, northwest. Mr. Lively
says Wilson is doing a good busi
ness, and prospects are fine for crops.
The town of Wilson is building a
Fystem of waterworks and will soon
have fine protection.

ducting a grocery store at 209 West

The loss of Fort Vaux to the Ger

been reduced to ruins. The French
still occupy the outskirts of the fort
as well as the trenches to the right

continues.

by the Russian embassy at Rome, the
Austrians have evacuated Lutsk, one
of the Volhynian Triangle fortresses.
Germans Finally Successful
Paris, June 8. The fate of Fort
Vaux which the Germans officially
claimed to have captured last night,
remained in suspense for a time to
day, but its capture by the Germans
was later admitted by the French war
office. Its loss will be resetted for
the sake of the garrison which so
valiantly defended it, although mili
tary critics assert it is of little stra
tegic value. The fort has long been
dismantled and was used by the
French merely as an observation
point..
