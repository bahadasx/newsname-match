NUMBER 5
Recall Petition
Filed Tuesday
4
A petition signed by 523 peti
tioners was filed with the city re
corder Tuesday, asking the recall of
Bert R. Greer as springs commission
er. The text of the petition, which
It is understood was drawn up and
circulated by H. G. Enders and his
associates, and a copy of which has
been open for public examination at
the office of J. A. Lemery, reads as
follows:
"To Charles H. Gillette, City Record
er, Ashland, Ore.:
"Whereas, the present Ashland
Springs Water Commissioner, Bert
R. Greer, having been in the office
of Springs Water Commissioner of
the city of Ashland, Oregon, for about
two years; and
"Whereas, he has shown himself
generally incompetent in the admin
istration of said office of Springs
Water Commissioner; and
"Whereas, he has been instrument
al In letting a one hundred thousand
($100,000.00) dollar contract to
Smith, Emery & Co. without compet
itive bids; and
"Whereas, he has paid six hundred
' ($600.00) dollars for 50,000 book
lets which were printed for the city
of Ashland, and did not ask tor com
petitive bids, and refused the same;
and
"Whereas, the said Bert R. Greer
has taken all the printing for the
Springs Water Commission, refusing
competitive bids and using more
space than necessary In publishing
the same In his paper (Ashland Tid
ings), in the above and other things
large sums of money have been lost
to the city of Ashland and the tax
payers of said city.
"Therefore we, the undersigned
legal voters of said city, availing our
' selves of the provisions of Section IS
of Article II of the Constitution of
Oregon, hereby demand a recall elec
tlon to be had of the Springs Water
Commissioner of said city."
Under Section 18 of Article II of
the constitution of the State of Ore
gon It is provided that it he (the
party sought to be recalled) shall not
resign within five days- after the pe-
tition Is filed, a special election shall
be ordered, to be held within twenty
days within his electoral district, to
determine whether the people will re
' call said officer.
Under the law, If Mr. Greer does
not resign within five days from
Tuesday a special election shall be
ordered, to be held within twenty
days, to determine whether the peo
pie will recall him.
Mr. Greer states that he has no in
tention to resign, has no reason for
resigning, and points to the physical
.plant of the mineral water mobiliza
tion system and to Llthla Park as
refutation of the charges made and
alleged against him. Hence it ap
pears that within twenty days an elec
tion will be held, at which the people
will have a chance to recall the chair
man of the springs water commission
or show their confidence in him and
appreciation of what he and his fel
low workers have accomplished. Mr.
Greer expresses himself as" being
much gratified that the recall peti
tion has been filed and states that
he welcomes the opportunity to learn
what the people of Ashland think of
him and his work.
The petitions have been In circula
tion for several weeks and a house to
house canvass of the entire city was
made to secure the signatures neces
sary.

While strains of music from the
horns of the Ashland band drifted
over from the Commercial Club
across the Plaza, and vocal harmonies
drifted in the opposite windows of
the city hall from the auxiliary club
room, the city council began their
June labors Tuesday evening. Coun
cilman Root was absent, having de-1
parted a few days previous on an
auto trip. The warm breezes which
wafted into tho couacil chambers
brought dreams of auto trips to tho
other douncllmen, but after Recorder
Gillette had droned through the min
utes, reports and bills the plunge Into
business drove all dreams of summer
vacation away.
The matter of decorating the city
hall for the coming celebration was
referred to the recorder and finance
committee with power to act. Requi
sitions for material for a cut-around
for the power house and material for
the electric light department were
granted.
A committee was appointed to co
operate in securing camping locations
for the celebration crowds.
The garage in the McCarthy build
ing at the corner of Granite street
was granted permission to place a
gasoline dispenser at the edge of the
sidewalk.
A number of landowners of the re
gion at the foot of Nevada street of
fered to co-operate with the street
department in putting this road,
which Is ordinarily impassable, into
good shape. The use of the city tools,
one man and a team was asked. The
matter was favorably received and
was referred to the chairman of the
street committee with power to act.
A. L. Irwin was awarded the con
tract for the construction of the curb
and gutter on Granite street, his bid
being 34.4 cents per foot, which was
one-tenth of a cent less than the
other bidder, Mr. Tiffany.
The lighting of the park was au
thorized. Some fruit trees on Ashland streets
were authorized to be removed.
The appointment of Kenneth Mc
Williams as extra man on the fire
department was confirmed.
The mayor reported that by the
appointment of two extra men the
checking up of the water system had
been accomplished.
Mr. Banta reported little progress
in getting his special committee and
the Chautauqua people together on
the matter of arranging for the wid
ening of Park avenue, and asked
whether the council wished to pro
ceed with condemnation proceedings
or give the committee further time
for negotiating with the Chautauqua
people. The mayor with the permis
sion of the council extended the
committee's period of service.
A representative of a fire hose
company was present and offered
some samples of hose for inspection.
Five hundred feet of Maltese Cross
rubber hose was authorized pur
chased. An ordinance regulating connec
tions with sewers was given Its sec
ond reading. The ordinance was
formulated to provide a method for
disposing of the drainage from the
Swingle barn by connecting it with
the sewer, and Its reading led Into a
lengthy discussion of whether the
passage of the ordinance would not
set a dangerous precedent as putting
drainage from barns Into the sewer
Is not allowed anywhere else. The
ordinance lost out, Councilman Banta
voting in favor of It In regard to
the Swingle barn, the board of health
was instructed to have the nuisance
removed.
After a half hour's discussion of
regulation of jitneys during the cele
bration the council adjourned After

Narrow escape and war time
flight of Violinist Skibinsky, the re
nowned Russian artist, who appears
at the Chautauqua Tuesday,, July 11.
That Skibinsky was able to return
to this country after visiting his home
in Moscow, Russia, at the outbreak
of the war, he owes to an accident of
four years ago, which in the opinion
of eminent physicians and musical
critics appeared to be an irreparable
misfortune.
He had just reached the zenith of
his fame, bis name a by-word in
the concert halls of the world, when
his left hand was mutilated by an
explosion of a cannon cracker. The
thumb was about torn off and the in
dex finger entirely severed, the rest
of the hand being terribly lacerated.
It is characteristic of the man's in
domitable will that almost instantly
in the teeth of the practical certainty
of defeat he set himself to the gigan
tic task of regaining the wonderful
touch and marvelous technique for
which he is famous.
Surgeons asserted that the hand
should be amputated above the wrist;
be defied them and recovered. He
went to an artificial limb manufac
tory to see what could be done. His
friends believed that the shock to
his nervous system, the grief over
his loss had deranged him mentally.
The superintendent of the works
said: "we can't make a finger that
you can play the violin with, what
you need is a head made for you".
Skibinsky replied, " you need one
more than I do". The young Rus-
A long, smooth slide, a dip over
"the bump" and an exhilarating
swoop over the waters of tho great

J j Natatorium Is done and will be one
ot tne uig leatures at tne opening
Friday. The slide starts high in the
rafters In the far end of the building
and bwoops down at just tho right
slope to the water in tho shallow end.
Building a slide at this time of the
world's history is expensive, too, as
the copper sheets with which it Is
lined are worth their weight in gold,
almost.
The "Nat" has been leased for the
year by Mrs. V. V. Young, an attract
ive young San Francisco business
woman. Hum Pracht will manage
the Institution. LaHt year under his
management the Nat did a much bet
ter business than In-former years and
became a most popular place.
A new lighting system has been in-
slan preserved. Fourteen fingers
were made before a suitable one was
obtained.

Commercial Club
Will Make Changes
The report of the committee of ten
which was appointed at last month's
meeting of the Commercial Club to
make recommendations for changes)
in the affairs of the club was read la
full at Monday evening's meeting oC
the Commercial Club and then taken
up a section at a time for considera
tion and action. The meeting was
well attended and the plans for re
organization met with enthusiastic)
approval in most instances.
The recommendation that the club
close out their billiard and pool
tables and take suitable quarters else
where, on the lower floor, establish
ing cozy ofCices for secretary and
trustees, and possible space for read
ing room, was, unanimously accepted.
This was the most notable change
recommended by the committee, and
It Is expected that arrangements will
he made within the near future to
carry out the plan'as outlined. Thero
Is no doubt but what this should In
crease the efficiency of the club to
a great extent, as the secretary will
be In closer touch with the traveling
public and strangers In the city, and
the Commercial Club headquarters
will be easily located by strangers
and visitors. It Is not definitely de
ckled as to just where the club will
locate the office but a room has beon
offered them In the Hotel Oregon.
Other notable changes in the con
stitution which were recommended
and accepted were the provisions for
the1 increasing of the board of di
rectors to 12, six to be elected for
six months and six 'or 12 months,
and the election of the officers for
a term of one year instead of six
months, as It Is at present.
The amendments were laid on the
table until the next regular meeting
at which time they will be voted on,
and election of officers was deferred
until that time.

will, on the 15th day of June, 1916,
having finished the development work
in Llthla park, submit a final re

We are giving you this notice In
advance, believing that it will be
necessary for the council, ln co-operation
with the park board, to formu
late for the maintenance and opera
tion of the park after that date.
As the funds In our hands for park
development will be exhausted it will
be necessary for us to withdraw our
employees from the park and it would
appear necessary that the council, in
conjunction with the park board,
formulate such plans for the further
maintenance as may be proper so it
will go into effect oi that date. , '"
