royal time.

TRAVEL TALK.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The summer travel season has
arrived. Thousands of mothers
and children will soon be on their
way to the country and the sea
shore. Observation would seem to jus
tify the statement that the ma
jority of mothers traveling with
small children fortify themselves
against possible contingencies by
providing cakes, sweets, fruit or
something edible to pacify their
youngsters.
Every traveler is familiar with
the sight of infants of various
ages engaged in feeding them
sefves. Despite the efforts to
keep the aidles and seats of pas
senger coaches clean they be
come soiled by contact with dirty
boots.
Children are quite commonly
permitted to play or creep over
the car floor and seats and then
stick their fingers and toys and
any available food into their own
mouths. It is obvious to the
most casual observer that this is
an exceedingly uncleanly habit.
It is likewise a dangerous one.
Disease leading bacteria are car
ried directly into the mouths of
these children in this fashion.
This makes it easily understood
how babies and little children of
ten contract consumption -tuberculosis.
No one should eat without first
washing the hands. The possi
bility of contaminating food by
handling with dirty fingers is
great. When children are too
young to understand this their
mothers or nurses should be care
ful not to permit them to eat un
til their hands are washed.
Memorial at Warfcrdsbnrg.
The Memorial services at War
fordsburg, May 30th, were un
der the management of the local
I. O. O. F. Lodge in the Presby
terian church. Notwithstanding
the rain, the crowd was such
that not more than one-third of
the people could find seats. The
Needmore Band furnished the
music. I. W. Zimmerman open
ed with prayer, followed by Dr.
Remsburg in a patriotic address
of welcome. Dr. McKibbin re
sponded with an equally stirring
oration to the "Boys in Blue."
Miss' Andrews recited a touching
war incident. A score of young
ladies gave a flag drill. A choir
of thirty young men and ladies
rendered old-time war songs.
Lunch was then served after
which there was more music,
with addresses and recitations
by Rev. C. W. Tanyhill and Miss
Jennie Smith. A "Rifle Drill
Troop" of boys went through the
manual of arms to the delight of
the spectators.
Letter to the tutor.
Philadelphia, Pa. June 2.
Mr. B. W. Peck.- .
Owing to the death of
my mother, Mrs. Brierly, you
may discontinue sending the
News to her address.
My. mother was Maggie Wil
son, daughter of James Wilson,
of Buck Valley. She married
William C. Shives who died short
ly afterward. Then she came to
Philadelphia where she married
again and died April 2, 1916.
She always enjoyed reading the
News up to the time of her death
because she was acquainted with
that part of the country, but my
sister and I do not know any one
there, so you can see that the
paper would not interest us.
Very truly,
Wm. J. Shives.
y. M. Patterson and sisters
Elizabeth and Blanche, and their
guest, Mr. Paul C. McKnight
motored to Baltimore latter part
of last week. Miss Elizabeth
remained in Baltimore, Mr. Mc
Knight went from there to Pitts
burgh, and the others returned
to Webster Mills. Will went
back to Pittsburgh Sunday.
Fine Musical June 17th.
The Mozart Concert Company
of Johnstown, Pa., will appear
here June 17th, at eight p. m. in
the Auditorium, under the aus
pices of the C. L. S. C. of this
place.
This company is composed of
eight talented musicians, each of
whom plays one or two instru
ments besides being vocalists of
exceptional ability.
Miss Anna Leola Hatcher, the
talented young violinist and lead
er of the orchestra, is also the
Reader of the company and her
solos and readings are alone worth
the price of admission. She has
a most pleasing personality and
a grace of manner that immedi
ately captivates her audience.
Miss Clara Egerter, director of
the vocalists and Contralto So
loist, is a teacher and singer of
wide reputation. Miss Egerter
is a graduate of the Indianapolis
Conservatory of Music and has
sung before Chatauqua audiences
throughout several states.
Mrs. Edwin P. Byers, the Cor
net Solist, has played before the
public since a child and has had
many flattering offers to travel.
Mr. Edwin P. Byers, the Tenor,
is a singer whose full round tones
have delighted many audiences
in his home city and surrounding
towns. He is constantly in de
mand as a solist.
Miss Katherine Horner, So
prano, Mr. J. K. Bole, Bass, Mr.
E. M. Bole, Baritone, and Mr.
Joseph Joy, Clarinet Soloist are
all up to the standard in the
rendition of their respective
parts.
McConnellsburg is indeed for
tunate in being able to secure
this company for an engagement
here and they should be greeted
with a full house. Which would
also make it both a financial and
social success for the C. L. S. C.
of this place.
Prond? Yes.
There are automobiles plain
and fancy that attract more or
less .attention, but a beautiful
mettlesome horse will never fail
to call forth admiration. Dolly,
Rev. J. L. Grove's ex-driver, is
now more than 21 years old. We
are safe in saying that the rev
erend gentleman attracts les3 at
tention while driving his Willys
Knight than when sitting behind
Dolly. Not long ago, she set her
own pace and went to Fort Lou
don in an hour and a quarter.
That saucy toss of her head leads
us to suspect that Dolly is a Suf
fragette. Proud? Well just no
tice her when she comes to town
from the Brookside Farm.
Crop Reports.
We have just received Statis
tician L. H. Wible's latest crop
report for the State. For Fulton
county he reports as follows:
Thompson township Livestock
wintered well with practically no
loss. Ayr township Livestock
of all kinds are in . big demand.
Tod township Wheat has picked
up considerably since last report
and grass is looking fine. Tay
lor township Grain and grass
are looking fine and prospects
good for bumper crops.
For the State in general, he re
ports normal conditions for crops.
Male farm help will be scarce in
many parts of the state.
He Advertised.
There is much corn in "Fulton
county Egypt," but there are,
also, many "Joseph's Brethren"
who need it. Recently S. B.
Woollet advertised in the News
175 barrels for sale, and a day or
two after the paper reached the
northern part of the Countv. he
sold all of it at the crib on his
farm in Dublin township, for a
dollar per barrel. The ad cost
him lSjcents; he got $175.00 cash
for his corn. Bring on your Ads.
We'll sell the corn.
Miss Mary K. Hoke expects to
return home from Chambersburg
latter part of this week, to re
main for the Bummer months.
Letter from Egypt.
We hear much about letters
passing between this and foreign
countries being censored, but it
remained for Mrs. W. C. Patter
son to demonstrate to McCon
nellsburg people how closely all
communications are inspected.
Last week, Mrs. Patterson re
ceived a letter from her sister
Bertha, Mrs. (Rev.) W. H. Reed,
of Asyut, Egypt, which was lit
erally clipped to pieces. Among
the items censored by the Eng
lish government in Egypt were
references to some of the things
that occur in a hospital camp
near where the Reeds are locat
ed. About 600 sick or wounded
soldiers have been provided by
the ladies of the United Presby
terian Mission with a tea room to
which the invalids could repair
for refreshments, reading, &c.
Some of the accounts of details
of their work were clipped from
the'.letter. Portions of many re
marks on other international
matters were cut out.
A lady who lives near the
Reeds makes lace to help support
a sister who lives near Rev.
Charles R. Pittman, in Tabriz,
Persia. The only way the Eng
lish government will send her
money to the Persian sister is
through the United Presbyterian
Mission in Egypt. She draws a
money order on the Mission, aft
er the manner in which we draw
orders on United States post of
fices. Mrs. Patterson received a
sample of the lady's needlework,
a large, circular piece of real
lace for which the maker asks
but $1.00.
Farmers' Institute.
Last week, County Chairman
of farmers' institutes called at
tention through the News that
three Institutes of two days each
were to be held in Fulton county
this year. These institutes will
be held at points selected by re
quest. It has been his custom to
spend a day in June at the Court
House for the purpose of receiv
ing applications. But, as Mr.
Ranck said, no one ever appear
ed, hence, he will not be there
this year, but will receive appli
cations in person, or by letter.
These institutes have been of
vast interest in the past, having
been the means of awakoning all
of us to the importance of keep
ing abreast of the times in all
phases of rural life. So much
that is new and better than the
old has been developed that we
can not afford to miss any of it.
The speakers give us hints of
what is going on, and frequently
settle questions of local interest
in the short time allotted for the
meetings. They are the forerun
ners of great things for the ris
ing generation.
Play Fair.
Complaint is being made that
teamsters leave stones of various
sizes in the middle of the Lincoln
Highway over the Cove moun
tain. Since the horse-killing
breakers have been removed,
stones are being used to scotch
wheels while the team is resting.
There is no objection whatever
to their use, but we greatly fear
that action for damages will be
brought against some thoughtless
driver who fails to remove the
stones after the team starts. The
stones should be removed and
laid on the wall at the lower side
of the road to prevent lighter ve
hicles from striking them with
possibly fatal results. The road
has been made good for all, and
all should play fair in the use of
it without waiting for the hand
of the law to reach out after
them.
Costly Fencing.
For every 436 rods of worm
fence built, an acre of ground is
lost to cultivation. Woven wire
fencing requires about half the
space, or 802 rods to the acre.
Of course, where land is used for
pasture only, the fence corner
space is not lost.
