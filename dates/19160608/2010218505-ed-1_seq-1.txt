Nomination Of

To Be Assured
Delegates Show More Ic(erest In
j Moose Convention
(By Associated PI-CBB.)
Chicago, June 7.-More Icad
ors are predicting tonight that
Hughes, will be nominated than at
any time, since the republicans,
began to assemble, : They de
clare that unless eigns fall tho
nomination of Hughes' will come
sooner than predicted. Thia view
is based on tho fact that 'con
ference:! between _.the leaders to
discuss the advisability of can
didates hi:vo practically ceased,
indicating that A majority of tho,
delegates' have already reached
a decision to name . Hughes.
Some say the Hughes boom han
grown ed ; that Roosevelt , no
longer holds tbo vote power
which hadj been conceded him as
a part of the program to bring
republicans and .progressives to
gether.
