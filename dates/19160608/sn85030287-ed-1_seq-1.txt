The rain so much needed, and
so long1 looked for came Sunday
night, to the extent of two and
one-half inches, and since that
time every wheat raiser is Meade
county has had the millionaire
feeling.
There is no question but that
rain was needed, but the general
condition of the wheat was not
as serious as might be supposed
considering the long dry-, spell,
and it now has a chance to make
a good crop. '
Reports from various sources
say ihat the barley has suffered
much for the want of moisture.
Spring crops are making a
marvelous growth, as are also
the weeds.
Married
Mr. Fred E. Peat and Miss
Lilith Reed, both of Fowler,

June 4th, by the Rev Mr. Jones,

The Hobo Question
With the approach of harvest
will come the harvest hands, and
the hobo. Meade, this year, as
little brighter this year thanfii years passed, will have her
share of these "tourists" to con
tend with. , Many will be worthy
and willing to work, while others,
the hobos,, will be here for no
purpose other than to cause
trouble. They will come long
before the harvest season, and
if they are here when it opens,
they will think . the farmer ought
to pay them a handsome' salary
for having them around.
It seems tba' there csght to be
some way provided whereby the
men who arrive before harvest
begins, who are out of money,
bnt who are really looking for
work, could earn a living, or at
least their board and lodging.
To those who show no inclina
tion to work, and invitation to

ther have ever been before. At
no previous time has our flag
meant so much to us. . It stands
for the might of a great nation
of one hundred million free peo
ple. - It stands' for American
rights, and these rights we dare
to maintain at whatever cost, but
even more than our rights, it
stands for our duties It is' not
power alone which the flag means
to us. It is synonymous also
with peace, with liberty, with
national aspiration, and with
good will toward all the world.
It is not an emblem of aggrand
izement at the expense of other
people. It mightily stirs our
patriotism, but it is not a symbol
of the perverted love, of country
which fosters ill will toward any
other nation great or small. It
glorifies America. It is for
"America First," but it is for
America first in the world's ser
vice. It means friendship rath
er than menace. It is the bravest
flag in the world because it is
the flag of a people brave enough
not merely to make sacrifices
for their own liberties and ngbts
but brave enough also to" stand
for the universal rights of men.
It is singularly appropriate
that, on one day of the year,
special homage be paid to the
nag, mat we remember upon
such a.day the rights for which
it stands, the duties tov which it
becons us, and the hopes it holds
out for mankind. For nineteen
years, June 14 has been observ
ed as Flag Day. This day is
this year the 139th anniversary
of its adoption as our national
emblem in the midst of a great
struggle for human rights and
liberties, which we achieved for
ourselves, and in a measure for
the world.
As governor of the state of
Kansas, in whose honor a star
was added to the flag in 1861, I
direct that the flag be dislpayed
upon flag Day, June 14 upon all
state buildings, and I urge that
it be unfurled upon other places
of business and even upon our
homes; that the editors of our
newspapers bring Flag Day and
its meaning home to our people,
and that, where ever possible,
appropriate exercises be held in
honor of the flag, especially in
our schools.

Peerless Concrete Silo
J. E. Evans, of Emporia, Kan
sas is spending some time in the
neighborhood of Meade and Fow
ler soliciting for contracts for
his Peerless Cement Silo. His
crew has just finished a silo
18x60 for A. D. Walker eight
miles north of Fowler and are at
present at work on a silo 18x60
for W. P. Bunyan four miles
north of Fowler. Mr. Evans
says that his experience for four
years in erecting sixty-eight
such silos that when his foreman
puts in the standard and special
reinforcement be designates,
that no one need be afraid of
cracking. Any troubles with
his silo, if any, are his troubles
and not the trouble of the owner.
He is urging Cattlemen to visit
the Bunyan Ranch Friday, Sat
urday or early next week and
notice ' the features absolutely
necessary to be a perfect silo.
. Mr. Evans will be present Fri
day aqd Saturday at Bunyans
and will be glad to explain all
matters. At any time telephone
Pete Elison at Fowler and be
will tell you where Mr. Evans
may be found.
"move on" should be extended.
The housewives of our city
can help materially, if they will
require every able bpdied man
who comes to their back 'door
asking for something to eat, to
earn it. It these fellows are
subjected to the "work test" it
will be an easy matter to separ
ate the two classes.
Liberal has adapted a plan,
and it seems a good one. It fol
lows:
The Chamber of Commerce
has made arrangements for tern
porary employment for all who
desire to work. A pile of ties
has been secured and is kept in
the material yard of J. G. Ault
When a man wants to work he
is given a cross cut saw and an
ax and has a chance to make
kindling out of the ties. He is
furnished in exchange for bis
work tickets good at any of the
restaurants in Liberal, entitling
him to one meal for each ticket
He can secure a bed at any of
the Liberal rooming houses in
the same way. No man is per
putted to earn more than three
meal tickets and a bed ticket in
one day. The kindling will be
sold to the residents this winter
for fuel. Mr. Ault has agreed
to look after the handling' and
selling of the kindling.
Housewives and others who
are solicited for money or meals
by strangers are urged to send
all applicants to the office of the
Chrmber of Commerce in the
Liberal Light, Ice, ard Power
office, where they will we taken
care of."

An increased interest is beinsr
shown in th nnppdmav nf
daily, both from the riders and
from persons who are counting
on viewing the race. Applica

coming in for some time from all
over the United States. When

start July Fourth, the cream of
the World's riders will be seen
in the keenest sort of competi
tion at the Dodge City speedway.
The management of the event
is looking for a record breaking
attendance and are laying plans
to care for more than 20,000
visitors. The two mile track is
being given a thorough dressing
and when finished will be able to'
accomodate the speed of. the
fastest machines. The Federa-

tion oi American Motorcyclists
rates the Dodge City track as
capable of caring for a speed of
more than one hundred miles per
hour. Prizes for the winners
