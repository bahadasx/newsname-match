term in Henderson ville. The school
was moved here from Lincolnton In
tiie fall of 1914. One hundred and
three students were enrolled during the
1913-16 session, making the largest en
rollment in the history of the school.
The final concert was given by the
students of the intermediate classes
May 29. The piano and vocal solos
were performed so well that space will
not permit taking up each number sep
arately; but any conservatory of music
mteht justly feel proud of the piano
recitals of the Fassifern girls. Ther.
lyere no false notes, no hesiting touch;
and the freedom and ease of action and
self-confidence showed that Miss Pix

the piano. ' .

bell Pixley at the piano. In the first
act a number of Japanese girls in
beautiful costumes are visiting O Hanu
San, a yoimg Japanese beauty who is
about to celebrate her eighteenth
birthday, regarded in Japan as "the
coming of age. After greetings are
exchanged between the hostess and
her guests, they all depart for her i
home in order to make preparation
! for the auspicious occasion. As they
depart they leave upon the stage,
Chaya, A Hanu San's faithful servant,
who gives the audience a little song,
in which she tells how overburdened
she is with work and care.
In the second act two American
girls, who are touring in Japan with
their governess for education and
pleasure, are impelled by curiosity to
enter this beautiful garden and while
their governess is sketching, they slip
away from her. The Japanese girls
returning, resent the intrusion of the
foreigner and . awake the governess,
who has fallen asleep at her easel, and
pretend not to understand her expla
nations, which she gives in several
languages. O Hanu San comes to. the
governess'' rescue and in the ' end in
vites the American ladies' to remain
as her guests and witness the inter
esting and quaint ceremonies that are
about to commence.
In the second act Miss Alice Atkin
son appears as the -Mikado, the ruler
of the land of flowers. The Mikado
will .be accompanied by eight attend
ants' in Eastern costumes, namely ;
Misses Erma Morris,' Mary Eiizabetii
Justus, Ashleigh. Ray, Mary and Neal
Few, Edwina and Jo. McMillan and
Mary Alice W'illson. The Japanese na
tional anthe m:'s sung and the Mikado
goes out. A graceful Japanese dance by
sixtcen young girl's demonstrates
Miss Pixley's unfailing, efforts in the
training of the figures.
The play ends, with a song "All

cession of lanterns and chorus. The

hardly be recognized that an election"
Was . being held here last Saturday, ex- ,
cept for the small group of men sta ,
tioned at the voting precincts. A
light vote fo:r the Democrats was cast,,
owing to the factthat theer ; was not - -
a full county ticket , in the field. Thet- V
Republicans made a better showing " f
as the candidates were plentiful for
most every: office' and the races had' . '
grown into rather a warm affair. -Strenuous
campaigning had been in..; i-,
dulged in by many of the Republicans '
for the past few months, as clearly .

Persistent efforts were - made - late
Saturday night by the Hustler to re
ceive the ' returns of the various pre-v
cincts-over the county. Owing to tel- -ephone
lines being down and the, long,
time it took to count the-ballots it was
impossible to get a full return. Not
until Monday morning did the candi- ,
dates find out the exact vote. v
The Republicans received a fair es-'

for sheriff and tax collector Saturday
