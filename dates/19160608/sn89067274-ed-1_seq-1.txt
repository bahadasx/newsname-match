The Fulton train due in Mexico at

a baggage car, in charge of Conduc

wreck might have been more serious.
A special train was made up in
Mexico to carry the doctors to the
scene of the wreck and the injured
were brought to Mexico where they
were taken to the Hospital. There
were about twenty-five passengers
on the train and several had narrow
escapes. Another train was made
up and left for Fulton at 10:30 only
about two hours late.

The fussiest baseball game played
on a Moberly diamond since the fans
seized an umpire in the old Hunt ball
park and threatened to duck him in
the "tank" pond, several years ago,
was played at Athletic park Sunday
afternoon, when the Athletics, who
have been sailing along with per
fect percentage, lost to the Mexico
team by the score of three to two.
Although Moberly's boat was rocked
yesterday's game, the vessel is
still leading the league.
From the first the Moberly fans
took exceptions to decisions made by
the umpire from Mexico. Two Mob
erly players thought it was neces
sary to "rough" the "ump" a little
and each of them engaged in a game
of "push face" with him. the um
pire stood by his decisions and made
no offer to retract The demonstra
tion of the fans in the grand stands
was steadily growing hotter each
minute and when the game was over
with Moberly defeated, the demon
stration reached its crisis. Rocks and
cinders were thrown at the umpire
by several fans as he rode away in
an automobile. Gene Williams, who
was driving the auto, came the near
est to being hit, as a heavy cinder
struck his cap and sailed on through
the auto, and a fusilade of rocks
was thrown at the rear of the ma
chine. One fan had a brickbat in
his hand ready to throw it but some
one knocked it away from him. At
the train a cordon of police was
formed to protect the umpire, if
necesary, but there was no further
trouble.
Yesterday s demonstration was a
repetition of the 'rush made on a
local umpire on the Mexico diamond
last season.
Lancaster, who pitched for Mex.
ico, was too strong for the Athletics
and Moberly did not register a hit
until the fourth inning, when Blake
singled. Only four hits were made
off Lancaster, Blake making two of
them. Reise hit for a single and
Nichols, pinch hitter in the ninth,
singled.
Mexico scored two runs in the first
inning, the first two batters pound
ing Ricse for doubleB. The Mex
icans got eight hits off Rcise, one hit
for three bases.
In the eighth inning it looked like
the game would finish by a score cf
at least 4 to 3 for Moberly. Rcise
singled and went to second on P.
Marshall's passed ball. R. Williams
was hit by a pitched ball. Sullivan
flied to center, Reise went to third
and Williams to second on P. Mar
shall's passed ball. VanStuddiford
flied to center, where the ball was
fumbeld. Reise scoring. With Wil
liams and VanStudiford on third
and second Housley fanned. Blake
was safe at first, Williams scoring.
Hassler clouted one to left field and
Van Studdiford and Blake crossed
the counting station, but were called
back by umpire Marshall, who said
it was a foul. The jigg was up for
Moberly and the fans went wild, de
claring the umpire was wrong in his
decision. The Moberly Democrat.

and best warships, with Lord

on their way to Russia for a con
ference with officials was sunk

R. P. Brown one of the largest feed
ers of Audrain county contributed
three loads of cattle Tuesday consist
ing of 67 steers that averaged 1205
pounds and sold to Morris & Co for
$10.35 per hundred.
This sale is nothing out of the or
dinary for Mr. Brown as it is natural
ly conceeded that his steers always
create considerable excitement This
is more of a habit with him than any
thing else. He is a big feeder and a
good one. His sale was a very satis
factory one from every angle. He
averred that the cattle made good
gains. He also stated that crops in
his section of the state with the ex
ception of wheat were in excellent
shape and said that a good stand of
grass was going to encourage more
cattle feeders this year. The Live

Catholic Dances Forbidden.
New York, June 7. That dancing
no longer, will be part of the enter
tainments given by the Catholic
churches throughout the country, was
made known positively this week
when a letter from the Chancellor of
the archdiocese of New York was re
ceived by all the pastors of Catholic
churches in the archdiocese.
The letter is "pursuant to a decree
of the Sacred Congregation of the
Consistory, dated March 31," which
"forbids under severe penalty all
dances at church entertainments."
This is one of the most drastic rul
ings ever promulgated by the Cathol
ic Church. The revival of a church
blue law, originating at the Third
Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1883
came as a great surprise and shock to
both clergy and laymen.
