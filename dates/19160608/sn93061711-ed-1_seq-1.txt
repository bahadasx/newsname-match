k WIND STORM DE
STROYS
PROPERTY
UAY
COON
A wind storm pnssed through this
county from the northwest last Sun
day afternoon and nearly gained tliu
proportions of a cyclone in some parts
of the county especially northeast of
town near the Canadian and Pajarita
rivers.
Several windmills and liarns on the
Shiflette, Dickey and other place-i on
the Pajarita. also the silo on the Ham
ilton dairy, were Mown down or badly
damaged.
Mrs. Hell's house on her farm lo
miles northeast of here was blown
over while Mrs. Hell and three daugh
ters wero in it and three of them os
caped with only slight injuries. One
of the daughters was rendered uncon
scious hut recovered without any very
(crious effects.
Fred Surety's house was turned
over hut Mr. and Mrs. Surguy suc
ceeded in got out of the house before
it turned upside down and smashed
dishes, furniture and stoves. The
house started and stood for a few sec
onds on one corner, the wind .seeming
ly not being strong enough to turn it
over. At this juncture Mr. and Mrs.
Surguy left the house. They had hard
ly gotten out until the house rolled
over on the roof. The children wore
up to their grand parents about a
mile west and wero safe.
At John Surguy's the wind was not
quite so bad but it was strong enough
to unroot a llve-year-old locust tree,
which stood at the bnck door where
the ground whs nearly as hard as n
rock. The rain came down in tor
rents and washed chicken coops far
out into the pasture, drowning nearly
all the small ones and also drowned
hens in the coops. It smashed wa
gons, and implements all along its
route.
Mr. Conger's windmill and ham
were in the route of the storm and
his ham and wind mill were torn down
together with other damage. Fence
posts the size of a man's leg, wero
broken otf at the grountT.
Al. Head's house was badly dam
aged, and it is said that trees were
stripped of their limbs and leaves.
A man traveling through the coun
try by wagon, reached the Canadian
nenr dripping springs and tried to
drive his team across. When he got
quite a distance out in the river his
team balked. He tried for some time
to persuade them to pull his wagon
and goods out of the river, but to no
avail. lie finally unhooked them from
the wagon and drove them back out
of the river which was rising fast.
In a few minutes the river rose sev
eral feet and took the wagon, clothing
and everything down the swift cur
rent. He came back to Mr. Congers

USE CARE IN APPLYING HRAKES
Mr. Montgomery of tho Union Gar
age says that a motorist cannot jamb
on his brakes without affecting his
purse. Locked wheels are immediate
ly responsible for tire bills. Ho show
ed the writer a new casing which had
been driven only a few miles, yet the
rubber was scraped away, exposing
the fabric. At the very moment the
wheels were locked by the brakes, the
tire was passing over a stone which
was dragged along with the tire. This
stone sawed right through the fabric
in one spot and fhinctured tho inner
tube. This careless customer, obvious
ly the author o fhis own misfortune,
complained that there was a "weak
spot in his tire!" Yet all his trouble,
delay and disappointment were caused
by smashing on his brakes when he
should have applied them gently. As
a matter of fact, Mr. Montgomery
says a car will stop more quickly in
almost every case if the brakes are
applied gently.

YOUNG MEN IN TUCUM
CAM AND QUAY COUNTY
The Firm Regiment of the Now
Mexico National Guard, which was
mobilized for border duty, May Otb,
JU10, at Columbus, New Mexico, af
ter the medical examination by Fed
eral examining oflicers, found them
selves something like three hundred
men short of the required number
which constitutes the peace strength
of an infantry regiment. This re
quired number. -even hundred eighty
men. is essential before the regiment
will be accepted by the Federal Gov
ernment. The First Regiment is now
waiting to recruit three hundred men
before being mustered into Federal
services as volunteers.
On May 28th, Adjutant General
Herring, of the New Mexico National
Guard, organized a campaign for re
cruiting in every section of the state.
A part of this campaign will lie car
ried on in the town of Tucumcnri. An
enlisting oflice will be established in
tho Hancock building for the next few
days.
Your State ,uaL Country needs the
services of every able-bodied young

tional Guard for the term of two yen s
A common error hns been that tho
public has conceived the idea thn the
First Regiment of Infnntry . to bo
mustered in ns regular troop of the
United States Army. This is not tho
fact. The mm of tho New Mexico
National Guard are waiting accept

boiler-maker, has, through his coun

in El Paso, against that company ask

Prof. J. A, Atkins, of San Jon, Is
announcing through the News that he
is a candidate for superintendent of
schools of Quny county, subject to the
action of the Democmtic primary, to
be held Saturday, June 17. Tho fol
lowing article taken from the Snn Jon
Times, a paper published in his home
town, is self explanatory and is very
complimentnry to him:
"Prof. J. A. Atkins, Snn Jon's pop
ulur school teacher, is seeking tho

could do NOW IT IS UP TO TU
CUMCARI! This city can hnvo its
own V. M. ('. A., and hold its head as
high as any city in the east as a pro
gressive town.
Mr. W. II. Day of El Paso, Inter
state Secretary of New Mexico and
Arizona, and West Texas, who was
here a few weeks ago looking over
the situation, will return about the
fifteenth of this month to begin oper
ations in earnest. Mr. Dny is one of
the big men in the Association work.
For the past few months ho hus put
in his timo exclusively, with tho sol
diers on tho Mexican border. He trav
els from camp to camp and post to
post, carrying magazines, books, and
papers to break the wearing monotony
of camp life. In the small out-posts
where there are but four or five men, ,
where news trnvcls slowly, he is a
most welcome visitor.
Mr. Da, is laying aside his work
with the army boys to come to Tu
cumcnri and help us establish our
"school for grown-up boys." Mr. Day
is cnthusinstic over the prospects here
He rendily saw the need of such an
institution at his last visit.
We had expected to be able to an
nounce that Mr. A. H. Richardson,
Secretary at Hisbce, Arizona, would
be hero thrnugh the campaign to co
operate with Mr. Day in this work.
When it comes to real live- workers,
Mr. Richardson stands right up in the
foreground. He is a born organizer
and promoter and can inject enough
enthusiasm into a dead fish to make
it swim in boiling water; it is hard to
tell what he could do to Tucumcari,
but conditions are such in Hisbce nt
tho present timo, that Mr. Richard
son will probably be unable to be hero
through the entire campaign. Never
theless, ho will do his best to bo her
part of the time, according to his Inst
communication.
Now, you enn talk Y. M. C. A., sing
Y. M. C. A.; dream Y. M. C. A.; and

papers for authentic news nnd bo
ready to pass it on to tho follow that
