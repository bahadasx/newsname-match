CHICAGO, Juno H Ah political
leaders gathered for the second duy's

gresslve national conventions It be-1
I came more and more apparent that
I there would b?? two tickets In tlto
u field. Victor Murdock. chairman of
the Progressive national committee,
I Buminod up the whole situation when
I he said today:
j "Well, we loft the door open and
the Ilepublicana don't seem to bo
coming In."
That wn? the Progressive lender's
reply to Inquiries an to whether there
remained any prospect for harmony
and whether there was lllcely to be
appointed today conference commit-^
tees representing both parties to receive
and pass upon peace suggestions.

delegates already have decided
to proceed without regard fc any
I third party ami nominate Justice
u Hughes, to whom the most support
i has been gathered.
There ate some among the Progressives
and some among Roosevelt
Republicans as well who s ill believe
the colonel could save the day If he
would come to Chicago. Representative
Gardner, of Massachusetts,
who was defeated for Republican delegate
at large from Massachusetts on
a Roosevelt ticket pleaded with Progressive
leaders to bring Colonel
Roosevelt on without delay. Word
came from Oyster Buy. however, that
Roosevelt had received the telegram
from Republican National Committeeman
Jackson, of Maryland, sent
, yesterday urging him to come here
f In the lntorost of harmony While
the colonel announced It was not his
present Intention to accept the Invitation.
he would make public bis reply
luter and be did not Indicate
what Its t,onor would be.
Tii Nominate Friday.
The Republican nomination for
president probably will be made in
the Coliseum tomorrow, but it is not
expected the convention will adjourn
before Saturday. Ostensibly the sosj
sion will be prolonged to give more
| deliberate consideration than is usual
to a nomination for second place, but
the real purpose, it la believed, is to
| avoid adjournment before the Progreslve
convention has acted.
Tho Progressive convention prob'
ably will not nominate before Saturday.
There v.ill only be a few hours
of session today and that will be devoted
to platform making and other
routine. The delegates are confident
that on Saturday they will name as
I their ticket Roosevelt and Johnson.
their standurd bearers of four years
ft go.
l-'nirhntik.? or Burton.
While there lias been little renl
discussion by Republicans of vice
K1 presidential possibilities and It is
recognized that geographical conditions
nnd political expediency will
govern, considerable talk was heard
< today indicating that there might b*?
I concentration on either Former Vice
President Fairbanks, of Indiana, or
former Senator Burton, of Ohio.
Nothing will be settled as to the
#v!ce presidency, however, until the
head of the ticket has been chosen.
