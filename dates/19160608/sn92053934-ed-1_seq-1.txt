Teut Losses
in Sea Fight
Berlin, Juno S, (via London, 11:45
a. m.) An official statement issued
i today gives the total soss of the Ger
! man high sea forces during the battle
Jutlanrl and up to me present time
h tl mijsor one ship of the
line of older construction, four small
cruisers and five torpedo boats.
The statement says:
"Of these losses the battleship Pom
mern was launched in 1905. The loss
of the cruisers Wiesbaden, Elbing,
Frauenlob and five torpedo boats has
already been reported in official state
ments. For military reasons we re
frained until now from making public
the loss of the battle cruiser Lutzow
and the cruiser Rostock."
"The Gorman victory was gained by
able leadership and by the effect of
our artillery and torpedo weapons.
"Until now we have refrained from
contradicting many of the alleged of
ficial English assertions regarding the
German losses. The latest assertion,
again and again repeated, is that the
German fleet lost not less than two
vessels of the Kaiser class, the Weist
falen two battle cruisers, four small
cruisers and a great number of tor
pedo boat destroyers.'"
The destruction of the Lutzow was
claimed in the first statement issued
by the British admiralty. At the
same time the British claimed that
two German battleships had been sent
to the bottom and six destroyers as
well as the ramming of a submarine.
The British, however, only claimed to
have sunk one German light cruiser.

Chicago, Jane 8. The standing of
Justice Hughes in the contest for the
ippuoncan presidential nomination
seemed stronger than ever today when
ine second days session of the na
tional convention opened at 11 a. m
developments of the last 24 hours
seemed to have made it plain that
neither the republican convention, nor
the progressive convention, which was
scheduled to open its dav's work at 2
p. m. would reach nominations before
Friday, if then.
Committees of both conventions,
named yesterday, worked most of the
night and this morning endeavoring
to clean up their work. The resolutions
sub-committee of the republican con
vention finished its deliberation at
1:30 o'clock this morning, having
drafted a platform. Other committees
pressed forward with their programs,

Meanwhile the rumor became per
sistent that Colonel Roosevelt might
come to Chicago and appear before
both conventions in the role of peace
maker. Republican leaders destroyed
a proposal to invite him and decided,
it was said, that if he is prepared to
declare himself out of the contest for
the nomination the invitation will be
forthcoming.
Leading progressives declared that
Roosevelt would be nominated by the
progressive convention regardless of
what was done by republican party
leaders. William Allen White of
Kansas, insisted that Roosevelt would
be nominated before midnight tonight
and that Governor Johnson of Califor
nia, would be nominated for vice pres
ident by the progressives.
SUB-COMMITTEE
REJECTS SUFFS
Proposed Plank in Republican Plat
form is Defeated by Tote of
Five to Four.
Coliseum, Jnne Th i nbli
can committee on resolutions by
a Tote of 26 to 21 decided to in
corporate, in the platform a plank
endorsing, in principle, woman
suffrage.
Chicago, June 8. A proposed plank
in the republican platform declaring
for woman suffrage has been rejected
by the sub-committee on resolutions
by a vote of five to four. The fight
will be carried before the full com
mittee.
Those voting in favor of the plank
were Senators Borah, Sutherland and
Fall and Representative Madden of Il
linois. Those voting against it were
Senators Wadsworth and Lodge
Charles Hopkins Clark of Hartford
Conn; former Representative Howland
of Ohio and Senator Oliver of Penn
sylvania. If the republican convention should
concur in the attitude of the sub-committee,
the rejection, in the opinion of
delegates, would form a direct answer
to the threat of the new Woman's par
ty, organized last Monday by the Con
gressional Union for Woman Suffrage,
to swing the woman vote of the twelve
states, with 91 electoral votes, against
the republicans.
The same threat, however, applies
to any other party and rejection af a
similar plank by the democrats, politi
cal leaders pointed out, would nullify
the suffrage attack as between the
two old parties. The progressives all
along have stood for equal suffrage.
Miss Maude Younger of California
and Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont of New
York, leaders of the Congressional Un
ion, in addresses at the Woman's party
convention, referred to the weapon in
the hands of the women of 12 suffrage
states, where it was claimed three mil
lion women are eligible to vote, as the
final weapon in the hands of the wo
men to gain the ballot for their sisters
in the so-called "slave" states.
The Woman's party stands squarely
behind the Susan B. Anthony amend
ment. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Cart, presi
dent of the National Association for
Woman Suffrage viewed the action of
the republican sub-committee on res
olutions in refusing to place a woman
suffrage plank in the republican plat
form, philosophically.
"I shall be disappointed if there is
not a minority report to the whole
committee," she said. "If we fail ther-
I t-hall be equally disappointed if the
committee minority does not take the
question to the floor of the convention,"

Republican Convention Gossip
I5T J. 5L C0LLIGAN.
(Special to The Argus.)
Chicago. June S. "Boys, the first
ballot will not be taken before Satur
day." That was the word that Sena
tor Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania
passed to his state delegation Tuesday
night in the Congress hotel. It was
the official word from the old guard,
the element that is in control of the
republican national convention in
progress at the Coliseum. There have
been intimations that Penrose was not
opposed to Roosevelt as the nominee
of the republicans, but from the wise
ones you get an altogether different
story. Penrose is among those of the
old guard who refuse to forget what
the colonel did to the party four years
ago. And they are determined that
Roosevelt shall not be chosen by the
Coliseum convention. The quoted re
mark of Penrose indicates, however,
that the standpatters are fearful lest
Roosevelt has a secret combination
whereby he could today make possible
the nomination of Hughes on the sec
ond ballot. On the first it is to be ex
pected that the vote will be divided
among the favorite sons. After that
it is purely speculative in what direc
tion the votes will drift. The stand
patters do not want Hughes. Roose
velt likewise has been quoted as as
serting if Hughes is the republican
nominee he will become the candidate
of the moose party. That is believed
by many of the insiders to be purely a
bluff. It is suspected that in the event
of Hughes winning the nomination
Roosevelt will support him and claim
the credit for his candidacy. Hughes
comes nearer to standing for the
Roosevelt policies than any other man,
with the possible exception of Borah,
who is seeking the place at the head
of the republican national ticket. Of
course Roosevelt is yet hopeful of
landing the nomination for himself,
but he realizes his chances are wan
ing every hour.
A story that comes out of the east
is to the effect that Hughes was
brought forward by the old guard for
the purpose of putting a quietus on the
Roosevelt boom among the republi
can delegates. The plan was to side
track Hughes when this had been ac
complished. Now that Hughes has
played successfully the role the stand
patters elected him to fill it is desired
to drop him. But the organization is
in a predicament not unlike the fel
low who had hold of the bull's trolley.
They can't let go. Hughes' strength,
it is said, is a surprise even to himself
and to his backers. The organization
has been on the verge of panic since
Mondav. Hughes' sentiment has been
i spreading like wildfire. The fear is, as
said before, that it tne convention de
cided to begin balloting today the su
preme court justice would come under
the wire on the second ballot.
In the meantime conferences are
being held by emissaries of the repub
lican and moose conventions. The
nower of Roosevelt is not underesti
mated by the republican crowd. The
efforts of the next few days will be
devoted to an attempt to so placati
the colonel, outside of a nomination,
that he will not run as the nominee
of the third party. Senator Borah of
Idaho is one of the chif factors in the
republican contingent that is seeking
to pacify the Rooseveltians through
George W. Perkins, who is the prin
cipal wheel in the moobe national con

vention. Roosevelt has declared that
I lie win iivl visjt vuiuagu wuiie tut: i.uii
. vpnt.inns are in nrnprpss. Neverthe
less the impression is growing that he
will march into the city not later than
Saturday, regaled in his Teddy hat, his
spangles and his red bandanna and that
the stage will all be set for him. It
would not create much of a surprise
if he attended the Coliseum convention
in a last desperate attempt to stam
pede the delegates either for himself
or Hughes. It should not be under
stood that the colonel has abandoned
hope altogether of being made the re
publican nominee, but if he can't get
it there is a growing conviction that he
would be satisfied with Hughes. If any
one else is chosen Roosevelt will have
his moose convention repeat the pro
gram that he executed four years ago
with such disastrous consequences to
the republican party. It is generally
agreed among the republican leaders
that a third party nominee would in
sure the reelection of President Wil
son. Moose chiefs share the same
opinion. But their argument is that
if they can't have their man named by
the republicans they are ready to ac
cept Wilson for another term rather
than see the adminstrative powers of
government passed to their enemy, rep
resented by the element that forced the
nomination of Taft in 1912.
SHERMAN HAS HOPES.
Those engineering the campaign of
Senator Sherman, Illinois' favorite
son, are basing their hopes for their
candidate on the possibility of breaks
to him from western and southern
delegations. Sherman is reported to
have gained considerable favor in the
past week among the southern delega
tions, which heretofore have been di
vided between Roosevelt and several
other presidential seekers. An eastern
friend who had the confidential ear of
Captain Walter A. Rosenfield of Rock
Island, campaign manager for the Illi
nois senator, suggested that Sherman
would be a strong man for the vice
presidency. "That's like inviting a
man to attend his own execution," re
plied the captain. "Mr. Sherman is not
yet ready to retire from public life.
His ambition is to climb, not back up
No such proposition will be enter
tained either by the senator or his
supporters. He is a formidable candi
date for the presidential nomination.
He has loj'al delegates and a big state
behind him. He is in the race to re
main until a choice is made. We feel
that he has an excellent chance to win.
He is gaining strength outside of his
home state. He is no longer merely a
favorite son. The candidacy of Sher
man is not a move on his part to get
free advertising. He doesn't need any.
He is a solid, sensible, long-headed
stateman. He would be another Lin
coln in the White house; not because
he resembles the martyred president
in physique and facial contour, but
because he stands for the ideals of cit
izenship and government that were
espoused by Lincoln. Io, sir, my
friend: you can't make books with
Sherman on any such basiB. He is
presidential timber. He'll either be
nominated for head of the ticket or he
won't be. If he does not win, he'll still
be a loyal republican." As the cap
tain concluded his speech, which was
delivered in the gold room of the
Congress hotel, where the Sherman
headquarter are located, he was cor
ralled by a dark delegate from Mu&-
issippi and led over into a corner,
where five minutes of close harmony
ensued.
AMONG THOSE PRESENT.
Rock Island county is well repre
sented at the republican and moose
conventions. Those seen moving about'
the hotel lobbies included Captain W.
A. Rosenfield, Captain H. A. J. Mc
Donald, County Clerk Henry Hubbard,
Sheriff George Richmond, Dr. F. A.
Smith, William Walker, Simon Lewis,
Dr. B. E. Jones, F. O. Van
Galder, M. 0. Griswold, John Miller,
P. J. Cary, Senator F. A. Landee,
Frank Gluesing, G. A. Shallberg, L. C.
Blanding, John Wallace, R. B. Lourie,
Frank G. Allen. Cary, Lewis, Miller and
Gluesing are assistant sergeants-at-arms
at the Coliseum. Cary has filled
the same position for many years at
republican national conventions, with
the result that he enjoys an extensive
acquaintance and popularity. One
thing P. J. never did and that is
turned down at the door a friend from
his home town. Pat says even that he
has let an enemy get by occasionally.
The assistant sergeants-at-arros of the
Fourteenth district held a conference
an hour before the opening of the con
vention Wednesday and agreed on a
plan to take care of those visitors from
their respective localities who were
not fortunate enough to come into pos
session of convention tickets. Tuesday
night seat tickets were quoted as high
as $300 each. Captain Rosenfield has
been besieged by hundreds of friends
the past few days for tickets. He has
almost made himself disliked by the
committee in charge of the distribution
of tickets by his demand for more and
still' more. But he declares he will
not quit begging until the committee
has hira forcibly ejected from its quar
ters. HELPING HIS BIG BROTHER.
In the busily engaged crowds filling
the lobbies of the loop hotels may be
seen moving industriously about, button-holing
every delegate whose atten
tion he can attract, a modest appearing
little old man with a gentle appealing
voice and a kindly face. Until you aw;
informed to the contrary, you would
imagine him a fund solicitor for a for
eign missionary society. But he isn't
He's the little brother of Senator Bur
ton of Ohio. He is older than the sen
ator. You will see the resemblance
after you look him in the eye. "Do you
know about my brother?" is his first
question. "I formely lived in Illinois,"
he told a Rock Island visitor. "Of
course, for years I have been a resi
dent of Ohio. My brother is a good
man. He would be a fine and capable
national executive. I want to see hira
nominated. I am not trying to induct
any delegate to desert his favorite, but
what I want you to do is to say a good
word for Theodore whenever you get
a chance. If you and other talk fav
orably of him you might change
enough votes when the time comes to
land him the nomination. My brother
isn't here, but he would be glad to
meet you at any time." And the little
old man flitted from one person to
another repeating his appeal in behalf
of his brother. His sincerity was al
most pathetic.

a man who, if elected,
would "place this nation where tt

and therefore true to all man
kind." President Wilson, he said, "
had "rendered to this people the
most evil service that can be ren

Colonel Roosevelt declared that

republican national convention re
cessed until 4 p. m. to await the report
of the resolutions committee which
was still working on the platform.
The convention wa3 in session about;
two hours and did nothing more than
perfect its permanent organization and
listen to some speeches.
A plank calling for nation-wide com
pulsory military training was defeated
by the republican resolutions commit
tee after much discussion, 19 to 23.
Two Tickets Seem Certainty.
As political leaders gathered for
the second day's session of the repub
lican and progressive national con
ventions it became more and more ap
parent that there would be two tickets
in the field.
Victor Murdock, chairman of the
progressive national committee, sum
med up the whole situation when he
said today:
"Well, we left the door open, and
the republicans don't seem to be com
ing in."
Republican leaders also discounted
the success of the peace talk, saying
that action had been delayed for so
long that a majority of the republican
delegates already have decided to pro
ceed without regard for any third
party, and nominate Justice Hughes,
to whom the most support has been
gathered.
There are some among the progres
sives and Roosevelt republicans who
still believe he could save the day if
he would come to Chicago.
The colonel announced it was not
his intention to accept the invitation
to come to Chicago Saturday by Na

lic statement later.
While there has been little real dis

WILSON FRAMES
DEMO PLATFORM
Washington, June S. President

a declaration of the administration's
success in guarding the honor and in
terests of the United States and at the
same time keeping the nation at peace.
The foreign affairs planks probably
will praise these acts of the adminis
tration: - .
Protection of the neutral rignta or
the United States and other nations.
Refusal to allow the country to be
drawn into Mexican internal troubles.
