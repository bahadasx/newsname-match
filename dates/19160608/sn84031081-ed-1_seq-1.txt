Raymond Robins, temporary chair-1
man of Ihe convention, had f-poken
three sentences of his keynote speech
when he mentioned Colonel Roose-ilhe,
velt's name. A wave of enthusiasm
(hat amounted to nothing less than
a paroxysm resulted. "The foremost
citizen of the world." was the char
acterization Robins used in connection
with his imention of the colonel's
name. The response was lnstantane-
ous. "We want Teddy," roared the i
ileleir.ites and the demonstration was
on. With umbrellas raised they tie
gm marching about the hall. They
flowed upon the stage und wrung Vic
tor Murdochs hand as they fi'ed by
until the stalwart Kansan's collar was
wilted. Hamilton Fish, Jr, and an
other man seised a delegate bearing
an American flag and carried him
around tho hall on their shoulders.
I'.anners were torn from their places
and stanchions were lifted from the
floor as the shouting host tramped
arou nd.
Can't Stop Demonstration.
Chairman Robins made several at
tempts to quell tlie demonstration but

progressive buttle hymns and soon

so blocked that no one moved for
several minutes. While the march
ers stood still in the jam, they kept
up Hie din, and after it had been go
ing on one hour, George W. Perkins
left the stage and decided to so to his
hotel und wait for it lo subside. The
Michigan delegation trumped in from
the rain outside and their leaders de
manded an outdoor demonstration
"Teddy is not afraid of the rain,"
they shouted. "Get out nnd march."
And in a body they fi'ed from the
ball into the deluge outside chanting,

Robins' Address.
The keynote address, delivered by
Raymond Robins, asserted in vigorous
terms:
.1 That the progressives will stand
by the announcement made by the na
tional committee last January that the
party will Join the republicans if the
latter nominates for president a man
true to progressive principles:
2. That the principle, however, is
greater than the party, and if need
be the progressives will go on alone;
