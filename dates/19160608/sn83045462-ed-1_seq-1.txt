?Col. Theodore Roosevelt will
SO to Chicago if "the republican
convention desires me to address
it." This he announced today in
a replv made to the invitation he
received last night from Senator
William B. Tackson of Maryland,
asking him to come to Chicago.
The colonel declared in his an- \
swer that he hoped both the re- j
publicans and progressives would'
nominate a man. who. if elected,
would "place this nation where it
belongs by making it true to itself
and therefore true to all mankind."
President Wilson, lie said, had
"rendered to this people the most
evil service that can be rendered
to a great democracy."
Col. Roosevelt declared that the
"differences that have divided not 1

sives. but good Americans of all i

"Can . we not." he asks, "for
getting pa*t differences, now join
for the safety and honor of our j
.country, to enforce the policy ofj
genuine Americanism and genu- i
ine preparedness?"
"Nation Supine and Helpless "
Col Roosevelt further declared that ,
.In "the face of the awful world cataclysm
this nation has stood supine and
helpless." and that "no excuse now
made by those responsible for this in- !
action is entitled to serious considera- j
t_ion. It is for you and your associ- :
ates to show the people that they have
a worthy alternatixe to which to turn."

"President Wilson, however amiable his

most evil service that can be rendered to :

CHICAGO. lune 8.?Even
though the republican and pro- c
gressive parties reach a deadlock s
on a presidential nominee, sub- c
stantial harmony in platform i
declarations was assured today. F
Leaders of resolutions committees s
of both parties today co-operated
to frame documents in parallel p
vein on practically all political is- V
sues, including Americanism and tl
preparedness. t<
Adoption of the platform today p
promised to be the principal busi- ti
ness of the progressive conven- tl
tion. which was scheduled to a
meet at 2 o'clock Reports of the
rules, permanent organization and
other routine business was on the H
program to precede consideration T
of the platform Walter Brown "
of Ohio was the "organization"'
rhoice for permanent chairman, to b
-ucceed Temporary Chairman d,

-o-called insurgents again threatened
to oppose Brown with Robins
or Gov. Hiram Johnson of tr
California, but these moves did f
not have the indorsement of d
;ither man si
Basis of Opposition to Brown.
Those who disapproved of Brown did
po on the g*round that he had partiri- ?*
to
pated in many of the harmony con
ferences with republican leaders The
gi
insureenrv was so boated that the <om- .
bl
mittee on permanent organization
postponed its regular meeting for two j
hours to give leaders opportunity to
teach an agreement if possible m
The purpose of the co-operation be- pi
tween the resolutions committees of the m
two conventions was to work out their
drafts so that no hitch in a possible
union would come on that score. Tt was
desired that the progressive platform g
should not be so radical as to preclude ac- p
reptanre bv the republican nominee or
the republican platform so conservative a'
the progressives could not accept it in
case of a joint nomination. in
While it was expected that the final n<
draft of a platform would be completed R

da*-, there v. as a report current that j 4?
formal submission might be delayed j

Record Ovation Given. m
The progressive convention opened m
in the Auditorium yesterday with a
record-breaking demonstration for Col. **
Roosevelt.
For one hour and thirty-three min- ai
utes the delegates and spectators
roared, shouted, cheered and applaud- a'
ed. They sang the progressive battle B
hymn, paraded the aisles and over the ^
stage and howled down all attempts to
check them. it
The demonstration exceeded the previrus
record for such affairs of one m
hour and rwenty-nine minutes estab- bi
lished in the democratic convention in
I>enver in 1908 in behalf of William ^
Jennings Bryan, which had exceeded by
lour minuifh in** record niaue mat Bam?
year in the republican convention in
Chicago when *'ol. Roosevelt's ?up- w
porters sought his nomination over
William Howard Taft."
Raymond Robins, temporary chair- r*
man of the convention, had spoken just
three sentences of his keynote speech
when he mentioned Col. Roosevelt's
name. A wave of enthusiasm that
amounted to nothing less than a paroxysm
resulted "The foremost citizen
of the world," was the character!- !
zation Robins used in connection with j
his mention of the colonel's name. Th? I v'
response was instantaneous. "We want | t<
Teddy," roared the delegates, and thefh
demonstration was on. With urnbrel- j
las raised they began marching about c
the hall.
They flowed up on the stage and I vv
wrung VP-tor Murdock's hand as they P
filed by until the stalwart Kansan'i)
collar was wilted. Hamilton Fish, jr., I
arid another man seized a delegate ! h
bearing an American flag and carried I a
him around the hall on their shoulders. | w
Banners were torn from their places |
and stanchions were lifted from the 1 P
floor as the shouting host tramped
around.
Band Also Chimes In.
Chairman Robins made several at- P
tempts to quell the demonstration, but P
after a few raps of the Ravel gave it
up. The band chimed in with the pro- u
gressive battle hymns and soon the
surging crowd was tramping the aisles tl
to the strains of "Onward, Christian V
Soldiers " Despite the handicap of the
steps leading up into the balcony, the a
demonstration spread there and soon v

JOHN COSTELLO.
John F. Costello, democratic national
ommitteeman from the District of
olumbia, was today nominated by
resident Wilson to be recorder of
eeds of the District.
The nomination will cause wide- j
oread interest, not only because the
resident thereby declined to appoint a
egro, following a custom inaugurated
y Grover Cleveland, and continued by
very administration since, but also beluse
the nomination is just in advance
f the District appropriation bill, which
irries a provision that the District
ommissioners shall appoint the
acorder of deeds.
The office of recorder of deeds has
een vacant for twn years, the President
having obtained the resignation
f the last negro occupant of the office,
L. Johnson, a Georgia republican. |
or a long time after the resignation |
r Johnson it was generally taken for;
ranted that another colored man
ould be named for the place, and the I
imes of several democratic leaders in I
fferent parts of the country were laid j
afore the President by Bishop Walters i
f the A. ML D. Church, recognized by j
le President as the spokesman of col- j
-ed democrats.

The President had promised Bishop

About the time of this promise the
itention of the President was called

ie conclusion that his duty was to
