Head of Chamber of Com-;

' tude of City's Problem.
Bridgeport needs 10,000 houses at
once. The city now has the greatest
opportunity that ever presented itself
in the period" of its existence. While
all the manufacturing ' interests are
willing to do their part the require
ments of the city are pyramiding so
fast it would be impossible to keep
pace :with them if the combined capi
tal of all the banks in Bridgeport
were put' at the disposal of those re
sponsible "for the i welfare of Bridge
port. '
This is the substance of statements
made by George E. Crawford, presi.
dent of the Chamber of Commerce,
under a housing committee appointed
for the purpose, is attempting with
the aid of public spirited persons to
lay plans for judicious housing.
Numerous projects for raising funds
and planning housing have been sub
mitted to the Chamber of Commerce
committee which is headedvby H. H.
DeLoss. - . -
'The work of the housing com
mittee at this time," - said Mr. Craw
ford, "will be to determine how1 a
stimulus can be given to building of
houses for, workmen. .Whether this
will be by individual building; by cor
porations or by private or public in
terests is not material as long as we
get good housing. We need nearly
10,000 houses at once.- It is likewise
not material at this time whether
they be of the single type, the block
type or. the New York apartment
trpe. These are matters to be con
sidered later." , - . -

Second Days' Session of Two Conventions Open
With Outlook For Regular Republican Nomi
nation Going to Supreme Court Justice on
Ballot Tomorrow Progressives Say Old
Guard Hasn't Accepted Invitation to "Come
in," and the Selection of Roosevelt and John
son to Head Progressive Slate Now Seems
Certain. -
Chicago, June 8 As political leaders gathered for the sec
ond day's sessions of the Republican and Progressive national
conventions, it became more and more apparent that there
would be two tickets in the field. v
Victor Murdock,chairman of the Progressive National 0om-
mittee, summed up the whole situation when he said today:
"Well, we left the door open and the Republicans don't seem
to be coming in." '
, That was the Progressive leader's reply to inquries as to
whether there remained any prospect for harmony.
Republican leaders, too, discounted the success of the peace
talk, saying that action had been delayed for so long that a mai
jority of the Republican delegates already have decided to prcn
ceed without regard for any third party and nominate Justice
Hughes, to whom the most support has been gathered.
- There are some among the Pro
gressives, and among Roosevelt Re
publicans as well, who still believe
that " the Colonel himself could save
the day if he would come to Chicago.
Representative Gardner. of Massa
chusetts, who was defeated for Re
publican delegate-at-large from Mass
achusetts on a Roosevelt ticket, plead
ed with Progressive leaders to bring
Col. Roosevelt on without delay.
Word came from Oyster Bay, how
ever, that Col. Roosevelt had deceived
the telegram Republican National
Committeeman Jackson, of Maryland,
sefnt , yesterday, urging, him to come
here' in the interest of hapnony. While
the colonel announced it was n.ot his
present intention to accept the invita
tion, he said he would make public
his reply later. . '.
The Republican- nomination lor
President probably will be made in
the coliseum tomorrow but it is not
expected the convention will iadjourn
before Saturday.
The Progressive convention proba
bly will not nominate before Satur
day. The delegates are confident
that on Saturday they will name as
their ticket Roosevelt and Johnson,
their standard bearers of four years
ago.
The Republican convention was call
ed to order at 11:22 a. m. -
When the doors of the coliseum
were opened this morning, ' two hours
before the Republican convention was
due to begin butsiness, the pouring rain
which has soaked delegates and spec
tators for three days was still fall
ing. . -
The hall, was cold and damp but
the delegates made the best of it. The
band up in the gallery enlivened the
wait as the crowd began assemb
ling. The usual line of ticket speculators
braved the rain, hawking admissions,
the prices of which steadily declined.
Inasmuch as the temporary organi
zation had been made permanent yes
terday, nothing remained but to put
the proceeding to the convention for
its approval. The feeling among the
early arriving delegates showed a dis
position to believe the gloomy weather
might hasten the proceedings toward
a final adjournment on Friday but
among the men who control the ses
sions of the convention there was an
absence of prediction as to final ad
journment. Chairman Hilles finally got in and
had a short conference with Former
Secretary Stimson and Nicholas Mur
ray Butler, of the New York delega
tion. Chairman Harding also arrived
and the platform began to fill.
At 11:20 o'clock the band broke in
to the "Star Spangled Banner". The
crowd rose and there was scattered
hand clapping.
Monsignor Francis G. Kelly read a
prayer. The convention stood in si
lence as he read the invocation.
Chairman Harding was ready to go
on with the next business but the
band-Miegan "Rock of Ages." When
through the first bar. however, the
band leader saw he was out of order
and stopped it. Mr. Harding hen
called for the report of the creden
tials committee.
Senator Smoot, the chairman, came
up on the platform to make the re
port and was applauded.
The report, recommending the seat
ing of 987 delegates, was read by the
senator with . a list of the decisions
in contested cases. " It excluded two
delegates from the District of Co
lumbia, admitted two each from Alas
ka and Hawaii.
The reading of the -report was a
lengthy affair. Scattering applause
greeted announcement of some of the
conetsts. At its conclusion Senator
Smoot moved the adoption of the re
port. -
A rolling chorus of ayes put it
through.
The report of the committee on
permanent organization was next.
William S. Hahn, of Ohio, made the
report recommending the temporary
organization be made permanent.
Former Representative Bennett, of
New York, took the gavel and put the
question, and it was carried.
Mr.' Benett then presented Mr.
Harding as permanent chairman.
There was quite a demonstration and
PRICE TWO CENTS
when he tried to stop it with gavel.
the crowd cheered a little louder. Re
peated whacks of the gavel - only;
brought more of a demonstration.
The delegates rose and the cheera
rolled louder.
It was the longest sustained dem
onstration of the convention so far.
Finally, the crowd quited and Mr.
LHarding thanked the convention for
its approval.
Mr. Harding, ln a brief speech,
thanked the convention and then
called for the report of the commit
tee on rules. The report was not
ready and at the chairman's request
the band played, while the report was
being awaited.
Senator Smoot was recognized for
a supplemental report from the cre
dentials committee. It proposed to
give votes to the six delegates from
Hawaii, Porto Rioo and the Philip
pines and was adopted.
That made the total number oC
votes in the convention 898, making
495 votes necessary to a nomination.
Finally, the report of the rules com
mittee was ready and National com
mitteeman C. B. Warren, of Michigan,
presented it. It was an unanimous
report and has been published. Brief
ly, the rules of the convention are
those of .the House of Representatives
with certain modifications .to adapt
them to the needs of so different a,
body.
The report of the resolutions com
mittee was the -next order of busi-' v
ness but the chairman announced that
with the arbitrary authority which.
goes with the gavel he would appoint
former Secretary Stimson and Speak
er Sweet, of New York, to escort
Chauncey M Depew to the platform..
Bowing and smiling, Mr. Depew took;
his place while the delegates ap-
plauded.
This was taken to mean there waa
a delay in bringing in the resolutions,
report. "
-Soma of the delegates shouted'
"Speech." Eighty-two years old, the
famous New Yorker faced the con
vention. His voice still full and
round, carried better than those of
younger men who Jiad preceded him,
and he was given closest attention.
Mr. Depew tol the convention it
was the sixty-first anniversary of his
preaching of Republicanism.
"Today we have a world crisis in
which 1 even Christianity is doubted,"
he said in referring to the war. "Wa
are entering upon this canvass eith
er with an assertion of Americanism
that will keep us out of it, or a mollyT
