A great many people who earn le9s than others have
hank accounts because they are prudent, saving regularly a
part of what fhey earn.
It doesn't take much figuring to see the folly of spending
all you earn, thus robbing yourself of future independence
and happiness.
A bank account is the result of a sand look ahead. We
will help you save. Begin with any amount, however small.

AN AFTERTHOUGHT
A few daye ago, to be more exact
May SO, their was a day set apart by
the mayor of Beaver called Clean Ur
Day when all inhabitants of the town
wore asked to clean up their premises.
In this day ot advanced civilization f
teems that tolling people to clean up
is unnecessary, but It is not. We
approve of the mayor's policy aitd
believe that all who have the best
Interest of the town at heart Jolt, us
in tho approval.
Why not go still farther In this
clean up and do away with a nuisance
that la just as harmful, If nut more st,
than the numtroos things we are
cleaning up? None of us need be told
ot the countless diseases that are
spread by this puisanoe. Campaigns
were instituted long ago for Its thor
ough eradication, and the good that
has, been accomplished from them lb
already noticeable far and wide,
While jou are reading thii article that
very nuisance is in till probability near
at hand . Do your part by relisting in
the lnrge army that has declared war
on this nulance, THE FLY.

FIVE-INCH RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT
The continued dry spell which bad
begun to reach alarming proportions,
was broken Sunday night by a torren
tial downpour ot rain, Five inches of
water fell. From the reports which
wo have been able to get. Beaver,
seemed to be the center ot the storm'
The rain fell in torrent here and was
a flood rather than a rain. Btreets and
alleys were running full of water like
rivers,, basements were flooded and
many caves were filled by the'overflow.
The water came down Douglas avenue
extending the full width of the street
nnd with a swift current which carried
everything before it. Deep gulleys
were washed out and when the water
subsided a bed of sand covered large
portions of the street. -The greatest
damage was occasioned by the ravin
which crosses Second street, leading to
the Court House. The large metal
culverts were insufficient to carry off
the .flood waters and it spread to the
side flooding the Beaver laundry and
the Beaver Cleaning A Dye Works.
The water rose about a foot in this
building. The Arkansaw cafe was
also flooded and water entered Dad
Mansfield's rool hall and Cain's cale,
In fact, all buildings bordering on this
ravine were somewhat flooded. The
basements ot the Long it Lawson, Niles
nnd Stranathan buildings were each
filled more than half full by the flood
which came down Douglas avenue.
No damage was done to the buildings
by reason ot the water in the base
ments. The river Is running bank full but
the wagon and railroad bridges at thiB
point were not effected by the flood.
The railroad bridtfu at Laverne went
out and train service over the W. F, &
N. W-, was tied up for a few days
The heaviest rain fall seemed to be
la the vicinity of Beaver but all parts
of the county received a good soaking
While the rain came too late to save a
nort of the wheat yet there are thou
sands of acres which this rain has now
made, The harvest which only a fen
days ago seemed mighty doubtful h
now assured and hundreds of Beaver
county farmers will once more(have
bulging granarleB filled with the Gol
den grain.
MORGAN FOR CONGRESS
Honorable Dick T. Morgan, con
gressman from this district for many ' along
years, is again In the race for re-elec- ' whereas
qualified, and should he b nominated I for a number of years and at Forgan

him to enter upon the same and carry
the work without interruption

this Issue )t the Herald. Congress
man Morgan Is known to practically
gvery-voter jn Beaver.county and his
official career Uan open book, He hw
served the people ot this district faith
fully and well and, while there may be
those who do not endorse mil his actions
in Congress,-' those few will be found
opposing him chiefly because of differ
ence In political affiliation. e doubt
if another man in the the district could
have safe-guarded our Intertsts or
served the people generally more sat
isfactorily than has Congressman Mor
gan. We believe that should he be
nominated and re-elected for another
term that he would serve the district
and state creditably and perhaps better
than any other man who might be
chosen for the reason ot his long ser
vice in thai capacity and his familiar
ity with the duties of a congressman
and the needs of the people. We
believe that the voters ot Beaver
county are for Dick T. Morgan for con
gress and we are glad to again present
his name tor their consideration.
