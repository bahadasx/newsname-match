A bunch of Baxter fellows went
out to Neosho river last Saturday
night on a fishing trip. They
got the fish, too.
Mr. and Mrs. Ed Covey and
Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Harmon mo
tored to Neosho last Thursday to
see the Missouri State Fish
Hatcheries.
Porter Clark is getting in new
goods with which to make his
opening. Just as soon as tne

L. L. Dunham, formerly a res
ident of this city, died last Sat
urday in Joplin. He left a wife
and three children. Funeral ser
vices were held in Joplin, after
which the remains were brought
to this city for interment.
It has just been developed that
those big strings of fish which
have been coming to Baxter
Springs, being brought by Baxter
people, were bought with good
hard cash. The river is too high
for fishing, but some enterprising
fishermen out there keep a lot of
fish on hand, and the would be
disciples of Isaac Walton just go
out and buy them. And we can
prove it.
It now seems to be an assured
fact that Baxter Springs will be
fore the summer is past, have ra
pid transit communication with
the camps of Picher, Cardin and
Commerce. When that day comes
it is going to be asolutely neces
sary that at least two- hundred
houses be built to accommodate
people who will desire to live in
Baxter Springs, although work
ing and doing business out at the
camps. There is also going to
be another big camp opened up
within three miles of town. More
houses are needed. And the
more houses that are built and
occupied the more valuable will
be the other property in the city.
More houses mean a larger as
sesed valuation and a consequent
lower tax rate. More population
in Baxter Springs means in
creased business for the mer
chants. And of course that is
what is desired by the business
men. More people living in the
town mean more in the churches
and schools, and an increased
population means more civic
pride. More houses must be built.
The people who are building
houses today are not the moneyed
class. They are those who are
planning a home for the future.
If some people who have money
would build some bouses to sell
on the payment plan, or would
sell lots on the payment plan to
people who would build you would
tee a big growth in Baxter
Springs just as soon as transport
ation facilities are furnished so
people can get back and forth
from the camp. Come, let's get
busy. If it is going to take money
to get the transportation, let's
spend the money. Let's get a
move on. This is the golden op
portunity. Baxter Springs never
before had the chance to get in
the swim of progress. Let's not
overlook a single bet.

Dowell, who died on Tuesday of

Another nice rain early Mon
day morning fixed the corn for a
few days more. Corn is up and

growth it ought to at this time of

About fifty people spent the
day at the home of Bob Frazier
out on Neosho river last Sunday.
It is a regular Sunday occurrence
however. Everybody who knows
Bob Frazier likes to visit at his
place. The latch string is al
ways on the outside.
Bob Frazier is as sure to be the
Democratic nominee for sheriff as
the sun is to come up tomorrow.
A lot of Republicans are boosting
for him so they can have a chance
io vote for him in November.
Bob is far and away the most
popular man in the race in either
party. And he is going to win.
In these days of trouble over
the water, the American people,
some of whom talk the other way,
and others who do not let on at
all, are mighty thankful there is
a man at the head of things in
Washington who is doing his ut
most to keep this country out of
trouble. They may not talk in
favor of Wilson, but they are,
just the same.
If the worse comes to the worst,
Woodrow Wilson is going to
cause a force to go in and give
Mexico a good licking. He will
keep out of trouble if possible,
but the Greasers are trying his
patience sorely. He is not "too
proud to fight," as some people
think, but he does ' not want to
jump onto such a people as are in
Mexico unless it is "necessary.
All on the theory that it is rather
cowardly to whip some fellow
who is easy.
The biz strikes being made on
the Hocker land, three miles
southwest of Baxter Springs,
mean another mining camp close
to Baxter. So far three whop
ping big drill strikes have been
made, and the drilling campaign
will be continued until it is deter
mined just how long and how
wide the ore body is. It has been
proven 65 feet thick. When it is
determined what sort of develop
ment is needed arrangements to
that end will be perfected.

As Romans Do
There is an old saying, "When you are in Rome, do
as the Romans do." In other words, adapt yourself to
your environment
Irvin Cobb went even further and said, "When you
are in Rome you must have an aroma," which is carrying
the idea a little too far. But there's a good deal to be
gained by adapting yourself to the customs of t he country.
If the community is a modern one like ours,' and merchants,
farmers, stockmen, and people in all lines of industry keep
their funds in a bank and transact their business by check,
it's a good plan to do as they do. It's the custom of the
country, and a good custom, too.
