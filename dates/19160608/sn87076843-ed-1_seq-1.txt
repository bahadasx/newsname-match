The date for the celebration of
Pcrrysburg's Centennial has been
set for Thursday, August 24th.
A meeting of the Civic Associa
tion will be held on this (Thurs
day) evening, June 8, to perfect
plans and appoint committees for
work necessary for the big cele
bration, which it is proposed
shall be made high class and fully
in keeping with the importance
of the event which gave to the
great state of Ohio its most beau
tiful village.
The cheap, side show features of
carnivals and summer festivals
will be notable for their absence.
The program will include an ad
dress by Attorney F. E. Rhein
frank, an eloquent orator and a
product of Perrysburg.
Dr. Dwight R. Canfield, who is
one of the best posted men of the
state in matters pertaining to the
early settlement of the Maumee
Valley, has been chosen to read a
sketch relative to the history of
Perrysburg s early days.
Miss Bertha Ilillabrand has been
invited to drill 100 school children
n "songs for the occasion.
It is also expected that a pa
geant representing ten decades'of
Perrysburg's history will be one
of the big features of the celebra
tion. Many other features of enter
tainment will be added to the pro
gram which will make it a credit
to the town and the people.
The following poem by Dr. Can
field is worthy of preservation:
Eve at Old Fort Meies.
By Dwight R. Caxfield
The evening sun haajust gone down,
Behind the curtain cloud,
That rose from out the darkened west,
Light a sightless funeral shroud;
The cattle grazing in the field,
Their young beside them feeding,
Had to the barnyard taken path,
The faithful watch dog leading.
Voices from the distance borne,
Bv the fragrant air of tlowers,
Had, one by one, ceased to be hoard,
Disturbed by the threatning showers;
But like a specter in one's life,
That o'pr the path comes stalking,
And as quickly icceding from the
sight,
Or seen as illusions walking,
The storm cloud hid its ugly head,
The stars came out so tender,
That the muttering thunder ceased to
roll,
And the moon shown down in
splendor.
So all was still in the hush of niqht,
Not even the cricket was deeming,
To disturb the pall of the quiet scene,
And I was alone, in my dreaming.
By magic the ramparts seemed to
stand,
The block houses strong at each
angle,
While below, the moonlight lit the
stream,
That shone like a golden bangle ;
And from the Hag staff's airy height,
I saw the cojors Hying,
Me thought I also heard strange
sounds,
Weird moans, like some one dying,
I stood stark still upon the scene,
Which enchantment lends to story,
The field, none living now, were saw,
Then, as now made gory.
Then o'ped the mouths of Britain's
guns,
From o'er the stream's dark water.
And they bellowed forth their hellish'
lead,
With a flend-llke love for slaughter;
Till the Heavens tlamed with burst
ing shells,
And the earth in terror trembled,
The picture of a meteor's Btorra,
A pageant of demons assembled.
Then I heard the order, firm and
strong,
To the brave from the "Bloody
Ground"
"Maroh across the stream and spike
the guns,
But return at the bugle's sound ;"
(Continued on Eighth Page.)
The Perrysburg village schools
closed last week in a very spirited
manner. Besides the general rou
tine and rush which characterizes
the close of school, the attention
of the people was attracted to the
school by five programs in three
days, preceded by the baccalaur
eate sermon Sunday, May 28th.
More people saw and heard
these programs than have wit
nessed such occasions for some
time. For the three night pro
grams, the auditorium lacked ca
pacity, and especially on Thursday
night, when at least 100 more peo
ple were present than there are
seats in the auditorium. This
speaks volumes for both the public
interest in the school, and for the
effective work done by the chil
dren. Throughout all the school
spirit ran high.
The baccalaureate sermon was
delivered in the Presbyterian
church by Dr. Win. II. Pheley. He
took for his subject the motto of
the class, "Building Character, not
Fame." The sermon was filled
with inspiration and advice, not
only for the class, but for all pres
ent. Wednesday night the High
School Dramatic Society present
ed "A Strenuous Life." By most
it was pronounced the strongest
and best play ever presented in
Perrysburg. The characters
played well their parts, and espe
cially Tom Harrington, played by
Edmund Shuster, Reginald Black
by Carleton Fiukbeiner, James
Wobberts by Donald Pheley, Dan
Davenant by Raymond Spilker,
Chia by Mildred Witzler, Dulcie
by Violet Kazmaier, Marian Dave
nant by Helen Anion, and Ruth by
Janice Leydorf attracted atten
tion.
Thursday afternoon the senior
class exercises were held. Sim
plicity was its charm. It began
with a piano solo by Gertrude
Shuster, followed by able class
productions. The president's ad
dress was given by Carleton Fiuk
beiner, nistory by Josephine
Davis, Prophecy by Gertrude
Shuster, Oration by Raymond
Spilker, Poem by Gladys Simmons,
and Valedictory by Myrtle Franz.
Thursday ended with a great
feast to a great audience. Digress
ing from the usual custom of hav
ing everything given by the high
school, a charming entertainment
was given by the grades, all grades
below the eighth participating.
The audience was enraptured as
the various drills, choruses, recita
tions, folk dances and musical pro
ductions were beautifully ren
dered. All were interested, all
were pleased. The compliments
given speak well for the pupils
and teachers.
The eighth grade exercises took
place Friday afternoon, and were
well attended. The program con
sisted of three symposia one on
Stevenson, one on agriculture, and
another on Michael Angelo reci
tations and national anthems, all
of which were well rendered.
This large and brilliant class of
eighth grade graduates speaks
well for a large freshman class
next year. Those passing in all
branches received certificates of
promotion, but those failing in one

Greatly Benefited by Chamberlain's
Liniment.
"I have used Chamberlain's Lini
ment for sprains, bruises and rheu
matic pains, and the great benefit I
have received justifies my recommend
ing it in the highest terms," writes
Mrs. Florence Sllfe, Wabash, Ind. If
you are troubled with rheumatic pains
you will certainly bo pleased with tho
Erompt relief which Chamberlain's
dniment affords. For sale by all
dealers.
No game last Sunday and the
fans were disappointed.
The Oak Harbor team started
for Perrysburg in an auto truck,
but a break-down prevented the
boys arriving here on time.
Arrangements were then made
for a game with Maumee, but
when the locals appeared on the
ground they were greeted with a
cloud burst and the hopes for an
interesting game were drowned.
Next Sunday the Future base
ball club will be here for a game.
The Futures have a fast team aud
play real base ball. Last year they
lost and won a game here, and
they aro anxious to do better this
season.
Come out and enjoy a good
game and give your encourage
ment to the home team.

THE INDIAN BELL
Will Return to Its Former Home
at Perrysburg.
The old Indian Bell is now on its
way from Maryland and will soon
arrive in Perrysburg where its
musical tones first excited the at
tention and admiration of the na
tives. The ladies of the Civic Associa
tion have purchased the bell and
expect to give it a home possibly
erecting a log cabin for it on the
Way Park grounds. '
BOWLING GREEN RACES.

lovers of good racing.

is assured of fine entertainment.
