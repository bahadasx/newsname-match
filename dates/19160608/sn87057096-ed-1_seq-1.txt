THE PRIMARY ELECTION
Harding Nominated for Governor.
Results in Decatur County for
Governor and Local Offices.
The primary election on Monday
brought a good many surprises in
both the state and county. Hard
ing was nominated by an overwhelm
ing vote, and it is thought he will
have a clear majority over all the
other republican candidates. He car
ried Decatur county by a vote of 65i
to 415 for Allen, 359 for Cosson and
242 for Keuhnle.
Harding was nominated for gover
nor, his total vote in the state being
96,930, Cosson 46,477, Allen 36,491
and Keuhnle 13.S11, giving Harding
a majority over all the other candi
dates. For lieutenant governor on
the republican ticket Moore was nom
inated, and Brown receives the nomi
nation for state treasurer. For at
torney general there were six candi
dates, and it will go to the state con
vention. For railroad commissioner
Guilier is the top candidate in the
list of five candidates. Scott Skinner
of Creston, was nominated for state
senator over Heaton, of Ringgold
county, by about 350 majority.
In Decatur county the following
county candidates were nominated:
Bob Craig for sheriff, ..Irs. Orra Gard
ner for recorder, Will J. Springer for
county attorney, P. C. Morgan for
member of the board where there
was a contest, Elba Shewmaker for
treasurer, Birt Baker for Clerk and J.
H. Hill for member of the board hav
ing no opposition. The big race was
for the nomination for representative,
there being five candidates. B. M.
Russell of Lamoni, leads the bunch
with 520 votes, but the nomination
will have to go to the county conven
tion, as in order to secure the requir
ed 35 per cent of the votes a candi
date had to receive 576 votes, so Mr.
Russell is 56 votes short of the re
quired number.
There were only three contests on
the democratic county ticket, John
A. Fulton, of Leon, being nominat
ed for sheriff, Mrs. Mabel Judd Ar
nold. of Garden Grove, for recorder,
and Charles Kelley of Richland town
ship, for clerk of the courts. Auditor
Walter Osborn, A. T. Weldon for
treasurer, county attorney Geo. W.
Baker, and W. H. Colter of Decatur
and E. J. Wilson of Woodland, for
members of the board having no op
rosnicr..

The latest returns up to the time
The Reporter went to press at noon
on Wednesday, indicate that the suf
frage proposition was defeated in tlie
state by between 5,000 and 6.000
votes. Tiie Register and Leader of
yesterday had tabulated returns from
94 of the 99 counties in the state,
which gave 13 9,253 votes for and
144,996 votes against. In the re
maining five counties both sides were
claiming they carried the county, so
there could not possibly lie much
change in the final results from the
above figures which would defeat the
of the election in more than half of
the precincts failed to give the figures
on tlie question on the outside of the
envelopes containing the poll books,
only nine precincts returning the of
ficial vote as follows:

Wouldn't Stand for Postmaster'
Little Scheme.
The little scheme of tlie Leon post
master who was appointed by the
Reed-Reynolds gang, against the pro
test of the county organization and
the big majority of the democrats, to
capture the county organization and
secure a delegation to the county
convention which would endorse Rey
nolds l'or committeeman, was inglor
iously defeated, notwithstanding the
pleading of the postmaster that she
was entitled to an endorsement for
Reynolds. Printed lists of delegates
were used, and on the lists were some
democrats who were known to be op
posed to the postmaster, but their
names were used in an attempt, to
pull through delegations which had
a majority who would respond to the
wishes of the postmaster, but the
democrats in all parts of the county
would not stand for the scheme and
the postmaster went down in defeat
in every precinct. In Leon there was
a very warm fight over the selection
of party committeemen, Dr. F. A.
Bowman defeating Jas. W. Hurst in
the third ward by a vote of 35 to 25.
A worse defeat was administered in
the second ward where Chas. E. Hurst
defeated Louis Elweil by a vote of
25 to 10, and in the first ward Lester
Hutchinson defeated T. J. Griffin by
a vote of 19 to IS. In all three
wards the delegates selected at the
caucus were elected by good big ma
jorities. The postmaster was thus
served with notice that although she
could control the Reed-Reynolds or
ganization, she could not control the
Why There is No Commencement
Writeup.
The commencement exercises of
tlie Leon High School were held at
the opera house last Thursday even
ing and for the first time iti thirty
years The Reporter will contain no
riteup of the commencement. Tiiis
year the class saw fit to ignore tlie
'oco.l printing offices and bought
their invitations from a house in Al
bany, New York, when the local
printers could have furnished them
the same thing in this line as cheap
or cheaper than the Albany house,
bat they were not even permitted to
make a price on the work. It has
ne\cr made any difference with us
hoi her The Reporter printed the
invitations or whether they weie
printed at another printing office in
Leon, as regards our writeup, but
when they are ordered from an out
of town house we are not inclined
to devote space in our paper to a
writeup. An examination of the tax
books in the county treasurer's office
disclosed that the owners of the two
Leon printing offices pay this year
for school taxes alone a little over
$750.00-. The Albany house pays
nothing. We believe that the print
ing for the Leon schools should be
done in Leon by people who pay taxes
for the support of the schools, provid-
Leon newspapers devote many col
umns of space each year to school
notes and to boosting the Leon
schools and it is a rank injustice to
the papers to have printing for the
schools sent out of town without giv
ing the locai papers an opportunity
to make prices on the work, so the
writeup of the commencement exer
cises tliis year will have to be made
by someone else besides this paper.

Early Riley Will Take Naval Cruise.
Postmaster Earl Riley, of Decatur,
last week received word that lie had
passed both the physical and health
examination which he recently took
at Des .Moines, in connection with his
application to make the citizens
cruise on a first class battle cruiser
which starts on August 15th. They
will make a cruise from Maine to the
Bermuda Islands, and it is the first
time citizens have ever been allowed
on board a United States cruiser dur
ing a cruise. There will be about
300 members in the party, the object
being to instruct them in war
maneuvers, aeroplane, gun and sig
nal practice. Each member of the
cruise will be required to deposit $30,
which pays all expenses of the thirty
day trip. The examinations is a very
strict one. and we believe that Mr.
Riley is the third person from Iowa
to be accepted. He is anticipating a
great deal of pleasure and instruc
tion from the cruise.

A BREST GARDEN GROVE MAN ON
FRAUD CHAuGE.
Hines Sent Letters Through
Mails Soliciting Orders
For a *ee.
Creston, May 31.—F. G. Hines, of
uarden Grove, 33 years of age, was
arrested and brought here today and
arraigned before United States Com
missioner Hunt on a charge of sing
the United States mails to defraud.
Hines pleaded not. guilty and was re
leased on liond to appear before the
commissioner on Friday, when Unit
ed States District Attorney Porter
will lie here to conduct the hearing
and also the hearing of Postmaster
Fleming of Arispe, who is charged
with the misuse of government funds.
Hines admitted to the officials to
day that lie had received about 13,000
letters in a very short time, and a
postoflice inspector reported his mail
exceeded 100 letters a day at times,
indicating, they say, that he was do
ing a flourishing business. Tlie in
vestigation of Hines' business came
as a result of complaints to the post
office department.
It was said that Hines advertised
for persons to address circular en
velopes or letters, and that to pros
pective customers he wrote a second
letter saying lie would give addition
al particulars for a remittance of 10
cents. He claims, it is said, there
was nothing illegal in his manner of
doing business.
At the preliminary hearing at Cres
ton on Friday, Hines waived examin
ation and was bound over to the Fed
eral grand jury under a bond of $100.
He deposited a cash bond and was
released from custody.
