GERMANS CANNOT TAKE VERDUN,
DECLARES WHITNEY WARREN
By WHITNEY WARKKN.
;iu ( ,b!? tn Th? T* . -
Pans. June 7.?In view of the deep interest and anxiety felt m
Ameriva concerning Verdun, from whence I have this momcnt
returned. I desire to inform you that in spite of thc continued bom
bardment Verdun remains intact in point of its military defences.
The civil sections. induding the bospitals, havc suffered.
I had the honor of dining with General Petain and hil staff
Sunday. He ii most confident nnd not impressed with the German
successes about Verdun
General Petain combines all the qualities Americans like to
attnbute to a French chief, in appearance, generosity. modesty.
talents and courage. The morale of his troops is supcrb, unconquer
able.
The most miserable fearure of the Verdun affair is that the pnce
at stake is the heritage of the Hohenzollerns. Hundreds of thousands
ol French and Germans are MClificcd striving for a prize which.
acrording to all authorities, is e! no military value whatever, that
the Crown Prince may be made a Marshal of the Empire on the field
of Verdun and. bathed in their blood, then have permission to return
to Berlin.
From my personal knowledge and observation of conditions. I
believe that all the German armies may bc concentrated on the task.
While by sheer weight they may momentarily hold advanced points
of detence. they wil! never reach Verdun. Never!
