ed by the Pittsfield union.
The Berkshire street railway com
pany officials aro to be notified of the

CHEER ROOSEVELT
All Records lor Enthusiasm Broken
in Moose Convention
UPROAR STOPS PROCEEDINGS
Doubt of Ability of Leaders to Prevent
Former President's Nomination on
First Ballot.
ChkPRo. June II. The progressive
national convention opened in the
Auditorium yesterday with a record
breaking demonstration for Col. Hoose
velt. For one hour and 33 minutes the
delegates and spectators roared, shout
ed, cheered and applauded. They sans
the progressive battle hymns, paraded
the aisles and over the stage, and
howled down all attempts to check
them. The demonstration exceeded
the previous record for such affairs of
one hour and 20 minutes established in
the democratic convention in Denver
in WIS in behalf of William Jennings
Iiryan, which had exceeded by four
minutes the record made that same
year in the republican convention in
Chicago when Col. Roosevelt's support
ers sought his nomination over Willam
Howard Tat't, and exceeded by eight
minutes the celebrated demonstration
for William Jennings liryan in Denver
In ISiHi.
Raymond Robins, temporary chair
man of the convention, had spoken
just three sentences of his keynote
speech when he mentioned Col. Roose
velt's name. A wave of enthusiasm
that amounted to nothing less than a
paroxysm resulted. "Tho foremost
citizen of the world," was the charac
terization Robins used in connection
with his mention of the colonel's name.
'J'he response was instantaneous. "We
want Teddy! roared the delegates and
the demonstration was on. With nni-
brellas raised they began marching
about the hull. They flowed upon the
stage and wrung Victor Murdock's
hand as they filed by until the stalwart
Kansan's collar was wilted. Hamilton
Fish, Jr., and another man seized a
delegate bearing an American flag and
carried him around the hall on their
shoulders. Hanners were torn from
their places and stanchions were lifted
from the Hour as the shouting host
tramped around.
Chairman Robins made several at
tempts to quell the demonstration, but
after a few raps o! the gavel gave it
up. The band chimed in with tho
progressive battle hymns and soon the
urging crowd was tramping the aisles
to the strains of onward ( hristian
Soldiers."' Despite the handicap of
the steps leading up into the balcony,
the demonstration spread there and
soon the spectators la the balconies
joined in. Hanners were snatched
from their hangings and waved, bear
ing these inscriptions:
Teddy and safety first."
If Teddy was president where
would Villa be?,,
Why.take chances. We know what
Roosevelt can do."
Then the band switched to "March
ing Through Ceorgla" and a medley
of popular airs, and the aisles became
so blocked that no one moved for sev
eral minutes. While the marchers
stood still in the Jam they kept up the
din, and after it had been going on one
hour (leorge W. Perkins left the stage
and decided to go to his hotel and
wnit for it to subside. The Michigan
delegation (ramped in from the rain
outside and their leaders demanded an
outdoor demonst ration.
Finally at 2.37 o'clock Mr. Robins
resumed his speech, ntfer telling the
lenders that he would not risk men
tlonlng the colonel's name again. Dur
ing the remainder of his address
there were outbursts and demonstra
tlons, but they were short. When Mr
Robins declared tho American people
were waiting for tho progressive con
vent Ion to nnme a leader, tho delegates
chorused: "We'll name him."
Tho announcement of temporary
committees followed and the Prst day's
fossIoii of the convention was over
The prediction that the leaders would
not be able to hold their delegates
from the nomination of Col. Roosevelt
at the mention of his name had not
materialized. How long they will be
able to control them, however, Is con
coded by the progressive leaders them
selves to be doubtful.

BELIEF GROWING
THAT HUES IS
TO BE HUE
Circumstantial Evidence Favors
Justice, His Friends Declare
CLAIM 300 ON FIRST BALLOT
Second Ballot Should Show Sufficient
Lead To Assure the Naming of
the Justice.
Chicago, June 8. More political lead
cis were predicting the nomination of
Justice Charles Evans Hughes last
night than at any time since the repub
lican national convention began to as
semble. They declare that unless
the accumulation of overwhelming
circumstantial evidence fails to re
flect the situation in 'its true light,
the nomination of the justice will come
even sooner than has been predicted.
The men who take this view are prac
tical politicians who do not make es
timates unless they are bused on care
ful canvass of the delegates.
The situation is illustrated best by
the fact that conferences between
leaders to discuss the availability or
different candidates virtually have
ceased, indicating their belief that a
majority of the delegates already
have reached a decision to name Jus
tice Hughes. Convention observers
rind it impossible not to be impressed
by the confident predictions of these
leaders, who say that the Hughes
boom now has grown to such for
midable proportions that Col. Roose
velt no longer holds the veto power,
which until yesterday afternoon had
been conceded to him as part of the
program to bring the republican and
progressive parties Into accord.
The Hughes managers last night re
peated their claim that he will have
about 300 votes on tho first ballot.
Frank H. Hitchcock, spokesman for
the Hughes followers, said there would
be no attempt to nominate the Justice
(.a the first ballot and that It was their
desire to have all the favorite-son del
egates deliver their complimentary
voler.. He believed, however, that the
second ballot, with the release of
many delegates from their obligations.
would swell the Hughes vote to such
proportions that his nomination would
almost certainly be made on the third
ballot. Many of the Hughes support
ers were even more optimistic and
tald they thought that before the re
sult of the second ballot was announc
ed the tlrift would be apparent to all
delegates and there would be enough
changes of votes to bring a nomina
tion on the second ballot.

Opening Session Was Dull and
Uninteresting
HARMONY TALK CONTINUED
Conference With Progressives Expect
ed to Show Some Definite
Developments.
Chicago, June 9. The republican na
tional convention assembled in the
Coliseum yesterday, heard a keynote
speech delivered by Senator Warren G.
Harding of Ohio, perfected an organiza
tion and adjornued until 11 o'clock
this morning. It all took just two
hours, and in its lack of demonstration
and its strict attention to the busi
ness in hand was reminiscent of the
Philadelphia convention of l'JOO that
nominated McKinley and Roosevelt.
For one hour and 2H minutes Senator
Harding, the temporary chairman, de
livered a carefully prepared speech,
punctuated in the telling points with
brief periods of hand clapping and ap
plause, but at no time did a demonstra
tion occupy more than a half a minute
by the watch. The convention was 25
minutes behind the hour arranged for
its assembly, but when Chairman
1 lilies of the republican national com
mittee brought down his gavel at 11.25
o'clock it moved quietly and with pre
cision until adjournment at 1.25.
The talk of harmony with the pro
gressives who assembled in convention
about the same time was lost for the
time being in the work of organizing
the republican convention but it went
on under the surface meanwhile and
there were renewed Indications that
the republican leaders were consider
ing the plan of appointing a confer
ence committee to talk with the pro
gressives in the hope of 'finding a com
promise ground. Among members of
the republican national committee, the
report persisted that there was a plan
to have the republican convention it
self name such a conference com
mittee nt today's session.
Former Senator Jackson of Mary
land, republican national committee
man from that state, last night sent
a telegram to Col Roosevelt at Oyster
May. urging him to go to Chicago in
tho Interest of harmony and announc
ing that he would do his utmost in
case of an acceptance to have Mr.
Roosevelt given the privilege of the
(i nvention floor.

Listers Have Completed Work for

TOTAL VALUATION $5,646,917
Some Shrinkage Due to New Offset
Law and Reduction in Quantity
of Live Stock.
The listers, II. I!. Hutchlns, E. F.
Hock wood, James II. Grennan and Ed
mond Lafranchise have completed the
annual assessment of property for tax
ation purposes and closed their books
Wednesday afternoon.
In completing the totals the listers
find that the valuation of all property,
both real estate and personal, is $9-,-
381 in excess of the valuation secured
last year.
There was a loss of two in the num
ber of poll taxpayers but the listers
are of the opinion that there are more
bona fide residents in the list than
was the case a year ago.
In view of tho loss sustained through
the amendment to the tax laws per
mitting offsets up to $10U() and the fact
that not nearly so much live stock is
being kept on the farms, the listers
feel that the town has made an excel
lent showing, especially in view of the
fact that in some of the cities and lar
ger tow ns the grand lists are not near
ly so large as they were last year.
The total valuation of both real and
personal property Is $5,f)4ti,8l", divided
