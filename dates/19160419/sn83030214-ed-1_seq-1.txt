Ambassador?President's Speech Guarded
with Utmost Secreey.
I From The Tribune Bureau. '
Washington, April 18.?Presadeni Wilaon will la) tha mib>
marine issue with Germany before Congress to rnorrow.
Im ihe House of l-teprescntativeg, with ConfreM convened
in joint session at 1 oVIoek, tho President will say his tinal word
on tho distniSSion of nearly ? year that has brought the tWO BaV
tions to tho \erge of a break.
Developments of the most sotemn importance. giuuried
even from the President's elosesl sdvisers, sre expected to foi
low quickly.
The President. accoiding to a high oflkial, will indid tho
Kaisor of hrearh of international law, of the lawi of l.umanity
and of his own solemn pronii*-'^.
He will also start to Berlin hus earofully prepared note,
setting forth Bixty-live counts against the German submarine
polley.
The President will tell CongreSS, it is belir\od. that diplo
matic relationa with Germany are no kmger jnstifled. If Coe*
gress concurs, the next step would be to deliver his paagports
id rVmbassador von Bernstorfl and recall AmbassarJor Grerard.
The <>nly alternative, it is said. is an ultimatum to 0?r
many. demanding ? change in her U-boat policy. Then only
a eomplete backdown by Berlin would averf ? break.
