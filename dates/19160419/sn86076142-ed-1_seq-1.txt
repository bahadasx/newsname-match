Ultimatum Sent By President Wilson on the Submarine Warfare
WASHINGTON, D. C, April l0.--The President has sent a note to Germany warning her that unless attacks
on merchantmen carrying Americans, in violation of international law, are stopped, diplomatic relations will
be severed. President W ilson explained that the note is practically an ultimatum, but does not contain any
time limit. A demand, however, is made that Germany reply immediately.
Congress, alone, has power to declare war. There is only one instance in modern history where a break in
diplomatic relations between two first-class powers has not been followed by war. This is the situation be
tween Germany and Italy. The latter is at war with Austria, but not with Germany.

EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
"I have deemed It niv duty therefore to Bav to the Imperial Ger-
map government if still its purpose is to prosecute a relentless and In-
discriminate war the government of the Unites Slates la forced to the
conclusion that there is but one course it can pursue and unless the
Imperial German government immediately declares and" effects an
abandonment of its present methods of warfare against passenger and
freight carrying vessels this government can have no choice but to
sever diplomatic relations entirely."
After tracing the historx.of negotiations over submarine warfare
he said: "
"Tragedy has followed tragedy on the seas in such fashion with
such attendant circumstances as to make it grossly evident that war-
fare of such sort. If warfare It be, cannot be carried on without the
most nalnable violation of the dictates alike of right and humanity.
"The eovernnient of the United States has been very patient. It
has sought to be restrained from any extreme course of action by
thoughtful consideration of the extraordinary circumstances of this
iinnrecedented war and was actuated In all It said or did by sentiments
of genuine friendship which the people or the united stales always
have entertained and continued to entertain toward the German
nation."

ROME, Apr. 18. A crisis in the sul
phur production of the mines of Italy
has become a subject of grave con
cern to the government. This trou
ble Is partly due to the Increase in
recent years of the American mine pro
duction, nartly to a reduction In th-
output through technical mining diffi
cultles, and partly to the lack of man
ual labor. The whole of Italy's pro
duct averages 2,750,006 long tons, with
the mines of Sicily , considered the
richest. With the price of sulphur In
creasing from $11 a ton In 1895 to
nearly-$20 In 1914, the output In the
latter year fell below mat oi .
being but 337,232 long tons, the low
est output In a period of 21 years. In
the same year the United States' pro
duct almost equalled that of Sicily,
twlng 327,634 tons valued at $5,945,2:16.

BERLIN, Apr. 19. -Professor Hein
rich Cauer, a well known sculptor,
who has been engaged for some time
on a bust of Hindenburg, contributes
to the Bauseltung a pen picture of the
popular military leader.
"Hlndenburg's entire figure," he
writes, "from the crown of his head
to the soles of his feet, measures a
trifle over six feet. He h.ilds himself
with soldierly erectness, but his hoad
is usually bent forward, a habit which
one always notices In big men accus

a knight In armor. His deep voice,
and his remarks, often whimsical, but
never Injurious or Ironical, are full of
kindness and friendliness.

CRISIS
OVER CONSCRIPTION
POLITICAL LEADERS ARE TRYING
TO BRING ABOUT A MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING
Illy AniMM'Intrtl 1'reaa.l
WASHINGTON, Apr. 19. The pre
sident told congress, assembled in
joint session that he had given Ger
many Irrevocable notificatloin that the
United States would break off diplo
matic relations if the Illegal subma
rlne campaign is continued.
The American last word presumably
was In the Berlin foreign office as the
president spoke.
The president asked no action what
ever of congress. He simply informed
It of the accumulation of facts prov
ing that Germany's assurances to the
United States were being violated,
and that the submarine campaign,
despite earnest protests of the United
States, Ib being continued with re
newed vigor In contravention of all
laws of nations and humanity, and
that he means to serve relations un
less it Is brought within the law.
The president's note and address to
congress are final. They mark the
end of diplomatic, exchanges. A con
tinuance of the long standing friendly
relations, the president made clear,
depends upon German's conduct.
