ranking Republican members. WU- ?
Kon's determination to. address con
gress came suddenly after today's cab-1
inet meeting. He has guarded with
unusual precaution the words ho will
deliver. \To copies of the address will
be given out in advance and it was
said only the cabinet members sworn
to secrecy know lils' intentions. Von
Bernstorff called on Lansing almost
at the moment President Wilson was
arranging for a Joint session. The
German ambassador waa Informed
that" Lansing would not discuBs the
situation at chis time. It was evident
that Von Bernstorff was seeking in
formation on the United .States plans.
Willi ' the exceptions of the case of
Germany and Italy in the present war
there ls no Incident in history that
the severance of diplomatic relations
did not ?le-ir; a' declaration of- war.
While it was Indicated that some sort,
of communication would go forward
to Berlin about the same time as the
presiden t's address, terms of tho note
?were not clearly indicated tonight.

have oiptured troUizond, Turkey's
most important Black Sea'port. Trob
lzond fell after a joint attack of the
Russian land and cea. forces, a Petro
grad official communication announc
es. Trozlzond has been strongly forti
fied since the fall of Erzorum and the
Turkish garrison Is said to number
fifty-four thousand. The Russians
also are continuing to drive against
Balburt to the southeast, the capture
of which gives the Russians a solid
line for an advance eastward into the
Turkish province of Anatolia. ThlB
ls part of tho Russian plan to Isolate
Turkish forces at Mesopotamia.
Inclement .weather has* Impeded ac

Tho British Infantry entered the
German trenches at several points in
