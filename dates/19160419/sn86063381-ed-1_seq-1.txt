the laws had recently originated
and were based on imperative
principles of humanity. He then
detailed the attacks of the sub

unjustified and truly
cruel. He recited the Lusitania,

Attacks Made Frequent.
"Without a shadow of justifi

Germany made unwarned at

given the United States," he I Bemidji
said. "One of the most recent
and shocking instances of this
method of warfare was the deD.,
struction of the steamer Sussex.
It stands forth as did the sink

singularly, tragical and unjusti

the German commanders have

"If this stood alone there
could be a disavowal, some ex

criminal mistakes or wilful dis
obedience of the commander of

But unhappily this does not
stand alone. It is but one

the Cass Lake yards would be moved
