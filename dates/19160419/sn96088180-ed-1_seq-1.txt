Washington, April 19. A brilliant

"It waa a hypocritical speech,"
sld Congressman Mann, "probably

president hss been pro-English all

the same thing now."
"If the contents of the messsge

Washington, iprtl 19. President
Wilson today told congress of the dis
patch of a note to Germany that may
mehn the breaking of friendly rela
tions with that power. He spoke as
follows ;
"A situation has arisen In the for

It is my plain duty to Inform you
very frankly. It will be recalled that
In February, 1915, the Imperial Oer
man government announced Its In
tention to treat the waters surround
ing Great Britain and Ireland as em
braced within the seat of war and
destroy all merchant ships owned by
Its enomles that might be found with
In any part of that portion of the
"high soas, and that it warned all
vessols of neutral, as well as of bel
ligerent ownership, to keep out of
the waters It had thus prescribed,

much as the rules prescribed by that
law, rules founded upon principles
of humanity and established tor the
protection of Uvos of noncombatants
at sea, could not In the nature of the
case be observed by such vessels. It
based Its protest upon the ground
that persons of neutral nationalities
and vessels of neutral ownership
would be esposed to extreme risks
and that no right to close any part
of the high seaa against their use or
expose them to such risks could law
fully be asserted by any belligerent
government. The law of nations In
these matters upon which the govern
ment of the United States based Its
protest Is not of recent origin or
founded upon merely arbitrary prin

"It ! baaed, on the contrsry, upon

"Notwithstanding the earnest pro

the government of the United States
that It would take every possible pre
caution both to respect the rights of
neutrsls and to safeguard the lives

"What has actually happened In
the year which has since elapsed hss
shown that those hopes were not Jus-

of being fulfilled. In pursuance of the
policy of submarine warfare against
the commerce of Its adversaries thus
announced and entered upon by the
Imperial government In spite of the
solemn protest of this government,
the commanders of German undersea
vessels have attacked merchant ships
with greater and greater activity, not
bound upon every sort of errand.
Vessels of neutral ownership, even
vessels of neutral ownership hound

have ibeen destroyed Along with ves

times the merchantman attacked has
been warned and warned to surrend

PLOT EVIDENCE
New York, April 19. The arrest
of Wolf von Igol, formerly secretary
to Captain Franz von Papen, of the
German embassy, and the seizure of
papers In bis Wall street office were
reported today to have revealed much
new Information concerning bomb
plots of an international aspect sec
ond In Importance only to the sub
marine Issue.
It Is understood that German Am
bassador von Dernstorff has laid the
matter of von Igel's arrest before
Foreign Minister von Jagow In Ber
lin. Secretary Lansing Is being kept
Informed concerning local moves in
the situation. Bornstorff Is said to
be very anxious to recover the seised
documents. He has demsnded that
they not be photographed and that
they be returned to von Igel Imme
diately. The papers, however, are
still In the United States district at
torney's hsnds In New York, and
they have been both photographed
and copied.
Von Igel la Indicted for a crime
alleged to have been committed In
September, 19 14. It Is reported that
he did not become a German embassy
employe until one year afterward.
WOMKX WORKERS MAY
HAVK WAGES RAISED
Portland, April 19. The wages of
woman workers will be raised by law
If recommendations of a sub
commltee to the state Industrial wel
fare commission today are followed.
The sub-committee proposes a gradu

to the ability and length of service
of the employes.
Nsmtqulps, Mexico, April 18.
(Via Motor to Columbus. N. M.,
April 19.) The country hereabouts
Is being combed on the theory that
Francisco Villa may possibly, have
doubled back after the fight at Guer
rero and that he may be hiding tn
the hills and villages near. Naml
qulpa. He Is almost dally reported
from all points of the compass in
places hundreds of miles apart. The
entire territory is therefore constant
ly patrolled. With troops marching
In and out at all hours, army head
quarters is probably the busiest spot
on the whole system of communica
tions lines. Several minor clashes
with Villlstas to the southward have
been reported, but they are not veri
fied, Constant reports of scattered
Villlstas units come in, but Villa him
self has apparently , dissolved Into
thin air His wheseabouts Is a mys
tery to iGeneral Pershing and his
staff.
' The . strongest circumstantial re
port is that Pablo Lopez, who has
been repeatedly declared dead, but
who Is known to have heen wounded
In the dash with Colonel Erwin's
cavalry at San Qeronlmo, has aban
doned the litter In which he was
being carried between two mules and
Is now riding with twenty men.
Manuel Baca, reported killed In
the same fight, was later seen v In j
Namlqulpa and Is believed to have a
small force In the hills. Even the 1
former VIlllHta, '.General" Cervantes,
Is reported In the mountains with 80
men. . .
Their ability, to keep beyond the
Americans Is due to the rugged. char
acter of the district. Las Cruces cap-

Hunt for Villa Is Halted
Awaiting Confirmation of
Razors of Bandit's Death
and for Reinforcements
El Paso, April 19. While the
American expedition hunting Fran
cisco Villa halted awaiting confirma
tion of his reported death, or wait
ing for reinforcements to enable It
to pursue the chase safely, the revolt
of Felix Diaz again raised Its head
today.
Secret service agents are Investi
gating reports tbst a Diaz revolution
waa being perfected at border points
and that it would break out Immedi
ately after the withdrawal of the
American expedition. Financial In
terests favoring Intervention In Mex

new movement if the expeditton'a
operations did not result In interven

were trying to run down definite
clews' which might lead to the insti
gators.

the eastern part of Mexico, hut he is
said to he In touch with his follow
ers here and abroad. The movement
In which he was interested was tem
porarily suspended. It Is said, when
the American expedition entered
Mexico.
Carranzlstas at Juarez, disappoint
ed at the ridicule of American officers
at El Paso, still Insist that they ex
pect confirmation of Villa's reported
death and burial before night. Amer
icans have practically discarded the
theory that Villa is desd.
yon, through which . General Per
shing's headquarters moved from
Dublan to Namlqulpa, is a succession
of steep, Jagged walls, Its floor cov
ered with rocks and loose stones,
which endanger horses and men. The
whole country la Villa's old stamping
ground. The Villlstas know every
foot of the trail, every road and every
cave.
Pershing's headquarters have en
camped In a plateau near 'Namlqulpa.
The altitude Is 7,000 feet and the
nights are almost unbearably cold.
Heavy winds render the tents un
stable, and It la even difficult to walk
In the faoe of the chill galea.
