Action Closes Second Big Fight on
Army Bill?MiLitary Men Claim
That Bill Was not Proper Pisco tor
Water Power Legislation?
Washington, April 14.?The senate
late today adopt? d the army hill
amendment of ? enator Smith | of
South Carolina appropriating $15,
000,000 for a government nitfat?
I plant. The vote wjia 4 3 to 22.
This action disposed of .the second
big fight in the senate over the sen?
ate substitute for the house army re?
organisation bill. Senator Smith's
amendment provides for the sale of
[Panama canal bonds for raising the
required $15,000,0(0 and the
[dent is authorised to designate, hot
, more than five water power sites for
power plants. When products of these
plants, which will be operated exclu?
sively by the government, are not
needed for manufacture, of munitions
of war the surplus could he sold for
fertiliser.
Three Democrat!i?Senators Cham?
berlain, chairman of the military af?
fairs committee; yard wick gad
Johnson of Maine?voted against the
amendment, while iieven Republicans
?Senators Clapp, Gronna, JfceayOn,
La Follette. McCumber, Norrie and
Poindexter?Joined the majority in
suporting it.
Today's action wan taken in spite
I of the contentions of the military
committee that an army reorganisa?
tion measure was no place for. water
power legislation. A nitrate water
power section In th<? house bill was
defeated when the Hay bill was un?
der consideration In the house so
[that final determination of the,Issue
must await action In conference.
Over the objection of the military
committee an amendment by Senator
Pomerene giving military rank to
members of the dental corps! was
adopted.
Senator Wadsworth urged adpi
I of his amendment to
I to obey the orders both of .ths
dent and of the governor of their
[State. He said the amendment
would strengthen the proposed fed
lerallzatlon of the National Guard by
making ths officers and men federal
soldiers from the moment of enlist?
ment Instead of only in time of war.
Senator Chamberlain was willing to
accept the amendment, but consider?
able opposition developed among
Southern senators.
Asked by Senator Hoko Smith as
to the purpose of the amendment,
Senator Wadsworth said:
"The purpose is to place the Na?
tional Guard soldier primarily in the
service of the United States and sec?
ondarily In the service of the State."
"That makes it impossible for me
to vote for the amendment," said
Senator Smith.
The roll call on the amendment
disclosed the lack of a quorum and
tho senate receded until tomorrow at
11 o'clock whon debate on the bill
under the ten minute rule will be
resumed. i

"Money Bogs'" Answer to His
Stand on State's Rights and Com?
mercial Freedom.
Columbia. April 13.?All of the In?
surance carried by State Senator J.
, Arthur Banks, of St. Matthews, on
I his property and that of Mrs. Wim
berly has been cancelled, notice to
this effect having been received by
Senator Banks in a telegram today
from Samuels, Cornwall & Stevens, of
New York, through whom the insur?
ance was placed. Senator Banks came
to Columbia this afternoon and gave
out the telegram here. This insurance
was placed by Senator Banks while
he was in New York a few months
ago with Senator McLaurin.
In this connection it may be inter?
esting to note that Senator Banks is
one of the warmest advocates and
supporters of the State warehouse sys?
tem.
The following was given out here
this afternoon by Senator Banks:
"In my letter published in the News
and Courier on last Monday I used
substantially the following language: ;
'I have no doubt that this letter will
find its way to New York. It may be
that my insurance will be cancelled.
I hope not, but if it is, let it be. I
prefer insecurity and poverty in
freedom to security and wealth in
servitude.1'
The Telegram.
"I have now received the following
telegram from New York:
" 'Senator J. A. Banks, St. Mat?
thews, S. C: Companies notify us all
insurance for yourself and Mrs. Wim
berly cancelled.
("'Signed)
" 'Samuels, Cornwall & Stevens.'
^ 'T dared to raise my voice in the
cause of commercial freedom. I dared
to speak for the rights of a sovereign
State. This Is the reply of the money
kings.
jePra^^
be interests of this widowed woman
and her children, but I greatly over?
rate the temper of South Carolinians
if these facts do not stir them to ac?
tion. 1
"Men of South Carolina, let me say
to you in all earnestness, no truce
will ever be made between money and
liberty. Organized wealth is a mighty
power. :Cf the people do not destroy
it they will surely be destroyed by it.
You have only one weapon with
Which to fight. That weapon Is your
government. If you use this weapon
you will be free. If you fall to use it
ypu and your children will be slaves.
There can. be no compromise. "Choose
ye this day whom ye shall serve.' The
people of other States are choosing.
The federal Government has chosen
and Is acting with the federal re?
serve banking law. Our own State has
taken a short step In the Insurance
department of the sinking fund, and
wo have the experience of Germany
and the Republic of Switzerland,
where Insurance is controlled by the
Government and only costs the people
ten cents per hundred dollars, as
against the average of one dollar and
twenty-five cents In South Carolina.
"Let us use our only weapon?
our Government.
"There Is absolutely no other help
nor hope."
Insurance Record.
In conversation with tho News and
Courier representative Senator Banks
said:
"I have been engaged in business
since 1882, principally in the mercan?
tile business as a member of the firm
of Banks & Wlmberly, of St. Mat?
thews. In the conduct of my business
affairs I have been carrying consid?
erable lines of Insurance on storo
buildings, dwellings, ginneries, mer?
cantile stocks, etc. I estimate that if
the Insurance which I have paid in
my business connections were added
up and interest calculated on It up to
date It would amount to between forty
and fifty thousand dollars. During that
time in all my business connections
there have been three small losses,
amounting in the aggregate to a sum
not exceeding fifteen hundred dollars.
So that It is Inconceivable that my in?
surance should have been cancelled
because of its special hazard, but it
must have been cancelled solely be?
cause of the fact of my participation
in the Insurance legislation during the
recent session of the General Assem?
bly and my statements made througli
the newspapers."
Mr. E. E. Aycock of Wedgefield was

RAILWAY MAIL CLERK WINS
SUIT AGAINST A. C. L. RAIL?
ROAD.
Case Was one of Longest Which Has
Been Tried in Suniter County Court
in Recent Years, Consuming Nine
Days?Southern Railway Does Not
Have to Pay.
A. J. Andrews, colored, rail?
way mail clerk on the Atlantic Coast
Line train No. 68 on the morning of
July 7th, 1915, was Friday night given
a verdict of $3,012.50 against the At?
lantic Coast Line Railroad company,
which was one of the defendants in a
suit brought against it and Southern
Railway for $25,000, because of al?
leged injuries sustained by the plain?
tiff in a wreck which occurred be?
tween an Atlantic Coast Line passeng?
er train and a Southern freight train
between the Columbia union, station
and Royster.
The case wtu) one of the hardest
fought and longest which has been
tried in a Sumter county court in re?
cent years. It was commenced on
Wednesday, April 5th, and has been
in progress ever since that time, with
the exception of one day, when court;
was recessed in order that Judge De
Vore might be in Columbia at the en
banc sitting of the court.
The fight was a three-cornered one,
for the plaintiff on one side, and be?
tween the Southern Railway and the
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad on the
other side, each of these defendants
endeavoring seemingly to shift the
blame for the collision on the other
road. Messrs. L, D. Jennings and A I
S. Harby conducted the case for the
plaintiff and Messrs. J. H. Clifton, I*
W. McLemore and Mark Reynolds
were attorneys for the Coast tine and
Messrs. Frank G. Tompkins, J. C.
Kimball and Lee & Molse represented
the Southern Railway.
The arguments were heard Friday
afternoon and the case was submitted
to the jury at about 6 o'clock. Court
was reconvened at about 10 o'clock,
when the jury announced that it was
ready with a verdict.
^It, was general^ predicted by those
who heard tho case that a verdict
would be returned against the Coast
Line, the amount of it however, vary?
ing in the estimation of many from
$2,000 to $15,000.
The Coast Line has given notice of
a motion for a new trial. Mr. Jen?
nings stated this morning that he
would not appeal the case.

FIRE DESTROYS BUY ULI.
LADDIES DO GOOD SERVICE IN
PREVENTING SPREAD OF
FLAMES.
Large Piles of Lumber Burned Fierce?
ly for Nearly Three Hours, before
Flames Were Extinguished?Loss of
Penn-Sumter Lumber Company
Estimated at Between $5,000 and
$6,000, Which Was Covered by In?
surance.
Fire which was discovered at 3:30
o'clock Friday afternoon in the dry
kiln of the Penn-Sumter Lumber Co.
completely destroyed the kiln and
caused a loss estimated roughly at
between $5,000 and $6,000. For near?
ly three hours the fire burned fiercely,
and repeatedly it threatened to Jump
bey on' walls of the dry kiln and
exten djacent piles of lumber, but
the s i consistent work of the lire
ladd ?pt it back and finally con
que o ven when the walls gave way
*?
anc c e was nothing between the
m
bit & id the huge piles of lumber,
w" e# covered the yard.
? ted by a stiff breeze, the firemen
1 ? difficult time in going near the
1 w om the v;lndward side and had
^ t been that two streams from
^ steamer were turned on just about
** time the outside wall gave way,
flames might have spread despite
their utmost efforts. However, the
walls held for a time and the blase
on that side was met with a strong
stream of water which beat it beck
and kept it in check. The fire was
the hottest and fiercest the Sautter
department has had to face in a long
time.
Responding to the alarm of fire the
auto truck found the lumber in the
dry kiln in a blaze and word was sent
back that the steamer was needed. It
did not arrive until it was too late to
save any of the lumber in the kites,
but it proved of immense service in
preventing the spread of the flames.
The streams of water were very weak
until the steamer was attached, and
this served to suck up most of the wa?
ter from the water main, leaving little
for the other streams. Three st reime
were attached to thsv* irtsaaasr after
some time. HandictcpifMfi as they W*l#
by the absence of their chief, Who Was
out of the city, the department, aided
by the employees of the Penn-Sumter
Lumber Company, fought hard and
did not let up for a single minute un?
til the fire was nearly all over, and
there was no longer any danger of its
spreading. Several times a pile Of
lumber near at hand caught and was
extinguished by the hose. One time
one of the employees, of the company
went up on top of the pile and threw
down some of the boards which had
caught and put out the rest of thb
blaze with buckets of water.
The dry kiln was divided into three
compartments, with brick walls on thb
outside and separating them. Thb
outside wall of the kiln on the east
side gave way first, and as this Was
the direction the wind was blowing. It
seemed that the fire might spread, but,
as stated, the streams from the steam?
er held the blaze back. Later the out?
side wall on the west fell, but at this
time there was little danger of catch?
ing the lumber on this side, the wind
was blowing away from the lumber.
Parts of the other walls fell, but all
stood until the firercest part of the
blaze had died down, keeping the
flames confined and making the heat
mostly go upward until it was too
high to catch the other lumber. The
three kilns were all totally destroyed
with the hundred and forty thousand
feet of lumber in them. This lumber
was pine and popular and estimated
as worth around $3,000.
Mr. D. H. Foresman, manager of
the Penn-Sumter Lumber Company,
stated yesterday afternoon that the
loss would probably be around $6,
000, and that it was covered by in?
surance. He stated that he could not
say positively how the blaze started,
but that it was supposed to have
been caused by the hot sun without
and the heat within the kiln, where
the lumber was drying. Mr. Fores
man praised the work of the firemen
unstintedly, saying that they had dons
excellent work, especially considering
the fact that their chief was not
present to aid und direct them.
