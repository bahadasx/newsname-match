KNOXVILLE BOOSTERS
Well Pleased With Their Re?
ception in BifJ Stone Gap.
I On lust Thursday the Knox
-villn Trade Trip Boostei b visited
Hig Stone Gap and this section,
and according to the reports of
their trip they were delighted;
with their reception in South
west Virginia. There were
about 12(1 in the crowd and to
US they appeared to he ahoilt
' the nicest bunch of boosters
that has ever conio through
here. They were brought over
front Appalaehia in Appalaehia
and Big Stone Grip automobiles,
accompanied by a largo num?
ber of Appalachians enterprising
citizens, including their splen?
did band, which assisted in fur?
nishing music for the reception
here. The Journal ami Trib?
une, of Knoxville, had a repre?
sentative with the boosters,
and here is what he Bays in his
paper about their trip to the
"gap country :"
Auto Trip lo the Gap.
Knowing that wo were it dry
crowd from a dry town, and be?
ing wise, because they live in
Wise County, the people of Ap
pnlachia and Big Stone Hap
met us at the tram with '?The
Old Oaken Bucket," brimming
full, played by their band in its
best style. The university bund
returned the compliment, and
joined by the school children ,,f
Appalachian formed a proces?
sion that strung out for a dis
taube of a half a mile and
marched through the main
street of l he town, counter
marching and limn, without
any speaking, entering auto?
mobiles for the trip to Big
Stone Gap, for the party aban?
doned their train at Appalaehia
for the trip through the gap.
The Big Stone (lap reception
committee, headed by Will
t ioodloe, chairman. C S Cal ?
ler, Kurl Stouhr and It. It Al
HOVer, president of the hoard iff
trade, and president of the
South and West Coal and Coke
Company, were awaiting the
K'no wiliians at Appalaehia
with a string of forty uutoino
biles. The trip to Big Stone
Cap is three and a half miles
over one of the lines! roads we
have seen anywhere. The road
runs along the hanks of one of
the prongs of the Powell's river,
and indeed it is a beautiful
stream, while the sdertery along
the drive through the gap,
with the rocky dills touring
hundreds and hundreds of fool
on either side, surpassing any
thing yet seen.
At Big Stone Gap, the party
were greeted by another band
and by a crowd of between two
and three thousand, including
the six hundred ami fitly pupils
of the school.
Gen. Ayers' Welcome.
The address of welcome to the
gap country was made by < ion
It. A. Ayers, a Confederate vet
teran and n former attorney
general of Virginia, who greet'
od the visitors most cordially,
and remarked that (hey Inid
tried to make the Knoxville
parly's reception as warm as
the one be received at Knox
ville during the civil war when
for two years, anil t he others of
the Confederate army tried
without avail to break into the
town. But since then, ho said,
bia relations with Knoxville had
always been most cordial and
happy, be add. d that in all the
years the people of the Gap had
been doing business with the
business nien of Knoxville,
they bad received only fair and
courteous treatment, and lie
had never known a fairicr sei
of business people anywhere.
Big Sinuc Gap and Knoxville
had long und many business
relations, he said, und lie hoped
they would have longer anil
more. General Avers was
photographed with .fudge
Lindsay by ".Moving Picture
Jim" Thompson as the general
was presenting the judge.
The judge wore Iiis prettiest
smile, and made one of his liest
spoechos at this place, telling
tho crowd that be felt inspired
ti> ili? Iiis best because of iin
mcnsily of llio cordiality ?>f iho
reception tin' parly had recoiv
i-cl. Tlio judge than prosonte.d
l>r. Stuart, whom all tie- Y.elh
odist (nnd southwest Virginia
is full of tliciii) und most every?
body else. hereabouts know per?
sonally, and the doctor made a
splemiiii talk, cloning with a
line tribute to the people of Dig
Stone Gap and of Knoxville.
"Kidded" Mr. Helm.
Judge Lindsay then continu
ed ins can opening process, and
called out George Helm. He
"kidded" Mr. Helm a bit by
telling the orowd that he bulled;
on George at Richmond the
other night, and he fell down,
lint Ihiit he believed that Mr.
Hehn ought to have unotln r
chance, ami lie gave it to him.
Hut not for long, for In- soon
called hith down, in fact grab?
bed him by the tail of hi-- eo.it
and pulled linn down und push
ed him out of the automobile
from which the speaking was
done. Mr. Hehn opened with a
few jokes, and then set in to
try to loll I lie big crowd how
anxious the party wits le get to
Big Stone (iap. ".lust to show
you how how anxious wo eve re
to get here, I may tell you thai
we paid more than $3,000 for
the train to tiring an heie, and*'
?bin he got no further for
Judge Lindsay grabbed him by
ihu coattail ami dragged him
down, taking his place
and telling the crowd that
George ought to be ashamed of
himself. "Why, I lie idea of
getting up here dial complain?
ing to these people because we
had to pay a little matter of
three thousand dollars to come
up here and see them", said the
judge: "Why"', ho declared,
"it would have been worth the
money if it had cost us ten
thousand dollars. This reccp
tion is wortli any price," he
continued, The Judge then
added that he wasn't going to
take any more chances of open
ihg a "can of bud stuff," and
was goinn to do thi' rest of the
talking himself, BO the people
of the Gap country Would he
sure to hear a good speech. The
Jtidge then told the crowd
something about Knoxville us
an industrial and jobbing eon
tor, and dwell particularly up?
on the city's educational ad?
vantages, being the boat of tin
university of tho State and the
Summer School.
After the speaking, the Knox
villiuns were taken for an auto
tour of the residence Bection,
and saw, without doubt, some
of the prottisl homes they have
seen on the tour. One of the
homes they saw was the huh
gdlo of John Kox, Jr., the celo
brated no^i li-t, anil after see?
ing something of tlie beauty of
tili) Gap country, one can IIn
dorstand where Fox got the in?
spiration for the stories lie has
written about the wonderful
mountain section. About the
only thing Fox lias made
famous in this section that wo
didn't see is the rhododendron,
and that flowtr isn't blooming
yet?
The party then returned to
Appalachiu, covered with diist,
but tilled with pleasure because
of their wonderful cordial rc
ucption and filled with admira?
tion for the wonderful develop?
ment here and for tin- splendid
scenery for which this country
is famous.
At Appalacliia.
On tho return to Appalacliia,
tho boosters found another
large crowd awaiting l hem, and
there was another short speech
making session. The party
was welcomed by Prof, II. L.
Sulfiidge, principal of tho
school of this thriving mining
town, to which brief replies
were made by Judge Lindsay
and Dr. Stuart.
One of the gentlemen who
greeted the visitors on this stop
was lir. I. I'. Martin, former
pastor of Church street M K
church, South, now serving his
fourth year as presiding elder
of the Big Stone Gap district of
the M. B. church, South.
J. P. Elendricks, editor of the

To the country churches of

a necessity of civilization, and
not only must it bo perpetuated
and encouraged, hut its sphere
bf usefulness must lie constant
widoued, so that it reach its
ptoper position as the communi?
ty center.
it gives nie pleasure, there?

lives.
In witness whereof, I have
thereunto set m> hand, and I
