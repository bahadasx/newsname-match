The unpleasantness in Mexico f,with tLiB- '"d wlj ch groat
teems to be r rowing. War U o indignation? Haven't our arms
fashionable nowadays that every- and munitions manufacturer the
body wants to be doing it.
In those piping days of Demo-
. cratic "prosperity" it seems sin
gular to see such a rush for pub
lic job9 that hardly pay a living.
- li-Vtnt T.ar m Europo is to
crush militarism the Allies
should be fighting themselves as
well as Germany. The "militar
isna "reason for the war is pure
bunk.
If General Prosperity is mar
shalling t.ho'peoplo of this coun
try, as tho Democrats claim,
we want to know why he fco per
sistently overlooks o many
willing recruits.
Strange, how suddenly the
Democratic Jatate o'tice seekern
have conceived such au abhor
rence for liquor influence in poii
lies. We wonder what they
heard at that stato convention
recently held at St. Joseph'.'.
If we are going in forali th.it
projected preparedness, we will
besouo what 'uiilitaristic" right
hero in our own United State,
Maybe then Kagland wii! find it
necessary to crusn us, so sue
can continue to tell us where we
get off. 1

inspiring sight it would be to
aa to see the U. O I'. come
Bringing to lick the hand that
struck it with destroying feroc
ity four years ago. Roosevelt
roust be blind if k thinks he
can come baok as n 'Republican
on bis own terms, that he is to
have the nomination for presi
dent handed to him, and still
claim the resect and fealty f
the whole party. We would be
glad to welcome the I'oienel back
into the ranksbut hand Lim

four years more of Wilson com

tntics. If Roosevelt- is demand

will otherwise head the Progres

the Republicans to do is to toll

A "canned" editorial In onr
Onmocratia exchanges says:
"That 'bustod' treasury is still
paying every warrant against
Missouri (i.e minute it is present
ed." Well, that's uice. If tho
taU treasury Is so plethoric
with cash, why has it not paid
over to the schools that thr
hundred odd thousand dollars as
the Supreme court directed It to
io. ery school district in the
state was short in its revenues
the past yaar because this mon
ey was withvld.aud iuuumeious
instances tho school termj had
to be curtailed n that account.
If that money had been paid

would the treasury still e meet-
log every warrant up to th min

been restored to the fund to
VWhieh it legally bulongs, it is still

in tho face of consistency to de
ny him the privilege of buying
his guns and cartridges from us.
Resides that, isn't business bus-

true, determine to have a little
war with us before long, and
those guns wc have sold him will
be turned upon our soldiers and
tho bullets from those cartridges

the bodies of brave American
boys,' and there will be tears and
deep sorrow in hundreds oi
American homes. And our
chickens will be coming home to

better how 'the Germans feel
about our tales of arms and mu
nitions to hr foes.
The Democratic candidates for
the gubernatorial nomination op
ened their campaign at Columbia
last Thursday by slamming each
other around verbally. Here is
home of the. remarks they passed
at one another:
Lieut. Gov. Painter. 'There
are two things I cannot clq. I can
not buy my way into eftieo and I
cannot danco and sing." Mr.
Painter also reminded his audi
ern e that the statu finances were
not iu the best condition.
.las.A.Houchiu : "I am against
rotation in office. I want the !isb
and game wardens aad Capitol
workers to stay at borne and cot
run around over the state trying
to beat someone for office who
has no corps of clerks. 1 am
against putting the family on the
psyrelt."
John M. Atkinson. "W e
should not ge through this cam
paign pussy footing on the great
mora issues that confront us.
Ix't us come clean, gentlemen."
Free Sugar Gene.
Democracy has lost its great
battle cry. Free sugar gone
Tho old faithful staudby of the
Democracy has been thrown ov
erboard. Iast week the House
of Representatives, fcy a unani
mout vote, so far as the Uino
crate are oonccrned, voted te
take sugar off ol the free list,
where it wonld have gone auto
matically this fall- Instead they
placed a tariff ou susr.
Perhaps the Democrats of tho
House do not remember the
faithful services of Kroe Sugar
It has bean ta battle cry, and
the slogan, and tho rallying point
of Democrats when "Free Sil
ver," and "Phillippines" and
"Froo" everything else failed.
The orator who talked about
"free sugar for the uup of coffee
for tho working man," wilt liars
to revise his speeches.
The Democratic party has offi
cially and finally declared, that
so far as the working man is con
cerned, hi Ua got to pay for the
sugar that goes faUj bis cop of
ooffeo, as well as for the edffed.
Rut the party did what it could
to give us "free sugar."
It came near ruining some of
tha sugar planters of Louisiana,
and it scared some of the beet
planters of the west, but free
sugar wet in sight. Of course it
really did not make much differ
ence to the consumer. Ho was
paying a little bit mora for sugar
andcr a low tariff that was gradu
ally getting the augtr free, than
be ever had la hit life, but offl-
eially and govorntnontally speak
ing, sugar waa to be five.
And then came this horrid
war.
The govorutoat had to hav
revente, and more of it, and fre
eugar had to go.
"Free Sugar," for all its faith
ful years of service, deserved
something better from Democrcy

In (he Meantime, Drag.
Eon if wo were all agreed as
to just what kind of hard surfac
ed roads te build, and if we had
the money all ready, it would be
a lont time before we would ac
tually have the roads. Siuce we
are not agreed on the best thing
to do, and since wo do not yet
have the money to do it with, it
is evident that on most of our
roads we must get along for
some tiia,e to come with the ma
terial which nature used in build
ing the-Ei originally.
lho experience of the pr,st six
or eight years has shown that of j
all the iuipkmect used for roaJ
building, the simple dras, which
any man can make, in the best.

will have this summer. The j Gu..t

That Missouri r edt a change
In the conduct of herstate affaire
is admitted by a vat majority of
her citizens, resardles of tbeir
political affiliation. The St
Louis Republic, the recognized
organ of the Democratic party in
the state in a recent editorial,
says:
' The State of Missouri it goitg
to have a reorganirition of,
business methods. It is going
to see to it that ev&ry official who
handles state money, accouDts
for every dollar's worth that

is going to see that the spending

VALUABLE SOAP BERRY TREE

a Cieanaar of tha Skin.
The jabonceilo. or soap berry (iw
(Sapindus s&pocarial. grows in the
humid parts of western Ecuador. It
attains a height of about fifty feet
and has wide-spreading branches and
Immense quantities of fruit of the site
and shape of e&errtea.
The nearly transparent yellowish
skin and pulp surrounding the round
black seeds are so saponaceous aa to
be used Instead of soap by many peo
ple of Ecuador, being equivalent to
more than fifty times their weight of
that material
The hard, polished seeds have been
used extos!re!y in Spain and England
for waistcoat buttona. for they are
very durable and eldom brvak. They
are used also aa beads.
Although conaSderable quantities of
the berry r utilised totally, toes of
them rot co the ground every year,
there beiaj as yet little foreign de
mnnd for tbom Since they contain a
large percentage of vm!n. they
should be of value la the mxatifoctaro
