HAD SERIES OF FIRES '
House of Corliss Morrill Burned One
Day and His Barn the Next.
Two fires, one on Wednesday and
the other on the following day, de
stroyed the house and main barn on
the Corliss Morrill place above North
Danville, causing a loss estimated at
nearly $10,000 and carrying an Insur
ance of $5,500.
Mr. Morrill and his son, Lyman G.
Morrill, lived on the farm and em
ployed Mrs. Sadie Gamble as house
keeper. The two men were in St.
Johnsbury on business Wednesday
afternoon and about four o'clock in
the afternoon Mrs. Gamble started a
fire in the stove. A short time after
wards she discovered fire about the
chimney and started for the residence
of William Clement, about half a mile
away, to give the alarm. By the time
people reached the house the fire was
under such headway the house could
not be saved but they removed some
of the goods on the first floor and with
a bucket brigade saved the barn.
. On Thursday while the family were
at Mr. Clement's for dinner fire broke
out in the large barn. This structure
90 x 45 feet with the farming tools and
about 20 tons of hay was entirely de
stroyed. The only excuse given for
this fire was the possibility that a
spark from the house lodged in the
hay the day before and smoldered
without detection until the next day.
The Messrs. Morrill are staying for
the present at Mr. Clement's and have
not decided whether they will rebuild.

IN BUSINESS S3 YEARS
Henry J. Goodrich Began As Plumber
and Hardware Man When 21
Years Old.
Yesterday was the 33rd anniversary
of H. J. Goodrich's entry into the
hardware and plumbing business in
St. Johnsbury. He was a young man
21 years old then and began business
in the Demers block, now ossupied by
F. G. Landry. A year later Mr. Good
rich needed more room and moved
into the Odd Fellows block where he
has been ever since. The store was
thoroughly remodelled last winter and
is now one of the attractive places of
business in town. Mr. Goodrich is
54 years old now and is still in the
active management of his business.
There are no signs of a has-been
about Mr. Goodrich or his store. Keen
and active in his work, he has kept
well informed about any improvements
made in his line of business and has
adopted every one that would enable
him to do better or more modern
work. He has adopted the policy of
engagingmen for what they can do
rather than for what they charge and
eo is keeping fully abreast of the
times. -
Mr. Goodrich thinks the year he was
21 was an eventful one for him as he
went into business for himself, joined
the Masons and got married all in that
year.
Only one man is now in business on
Railroad street that .was In business
there when Mr. Goodrich started and
that is E. N. Randall. There are only
four other men in town still in busi
ness that were in business then. They
are A. L. Bailey, C. A. Calderwood,
C. C. Bingham and Charles Flint. Not
a practicing physician of that day is
left in town and only two lawyers,
Elisha May and Harry Blodgett.
Edwin L. Spencer was given a de
lightful party "Wednesday , evening in
observance of his 66th birthday. The
supper guests were his children and
grandchildren and his sister, Mrs. T.
E. Brewer of St. Johnsbury Center.
The menu included two fine birthday
cakes with candles and the affair was
in every way a most happy one.
TO BIEDHOTE
Contract Let For Addition to St.
Johnsbury House To Be Fin
i ished September First.
The contract for building the addi
tion to- the St. Johnsbury House, a
description of which was given by The
Caledonian a few weeks ago, has been
let. The woodwork is to be done by
the Cummings Construction company
of Woodsville, N. H., and the plumbing
and heating by the C. H. Goss com
pany of this village. The contractors
agree to have the house finished and
ready for use by September 1, this fall.
Men from the Woodsville office were
on the ground Monday morning mak
ing plans for the removal of the old
kitchen part that is to be kept in
operation during the construction
work, and men to begin the work will
come at once.
The bid submitted by the Cummings
Construction company . was $27,687
and the Goss company's figures were
$6,092. In addition to their work,
there will be the electric fixtures, an
elevator and the furnishings which
will cost better than $5,000. It is ex
pected the completed building will
represent a cost of $85,000 or more.
The stock paid in and subscribed
amounts to $51,700 and the hotel com
pany has secured the promise of an
additional loan of $15,000, the total
indebtedness when the building -Is
completed amounting to from $30,000
to $35,000.
The inside finish of the addition will
be the same as that in the main part
and with a good elevator installed it
will be one of the most attractive and
convenient hotels to be found in Ver
mont, qp New England for that matter.
This contract which will amount to
$40,000 or more, the parish house for
Notre Dame church costing about $15,
000 and a new armory costing $25,
000 will give considerable activity in
the local building trades. There are
several residences besides a large
amount o fremodelling and ' repair
werk also to be done this season.

Burke have been engaged to have
eharge of the . town 'house and farm

a Cantata, "Stainer's Crucifixion."
The combined choirs of many of
the churches . of St. Johnsbury will
join in rendering the above Cantata.
This chorus, made up of about 25
picked voices will, give a power and
volume to the music that will produce
a much finer rendering of this unus
ual cantata than ever given . in St'
Johnsbury before. The music most
graphically depicts the last scenes in
the life of Christ.
The choirs cannot sing together of
ten. They are glad to give tJieir ser
vices in giving a musical and religious
treat. Come and hear them.
Honor the days that brought death
to the body, but eternal life to the
Soul, of Christ, the hureh and the
World.

services In Memory of
The Great Sacrifice.
