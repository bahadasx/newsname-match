Somewhat Famous Case of Wright &

and Lawrence Goldheim Ends
MOTION TO SET VERDICT ASIDE
Should Court Deny New Trial, Case
May Be Appealed to Supreme
Court—Denison's Lo&s.
The somejvhat famous ease of
Wright and Kinney against Renfro &
Lewis and Lawrence \V. Goldheim,
brought to recover damages for the
falling of the Wright & Kinney brick
bu'lding on the west side of Main
street in the city, was on trial in the
district court for several, days and
concluded on Friday, when a verdict
was returned by the jury in favor of
ti\e plaintiffs for'two thousand dol
lars.
The readers of the paper will recall
that on the 12th day of October last,
the brick store building of Wright &
Kinney suddenly fell to the grornid,
causing the loss of the building and
the injury and death of a portion of
those who were tenants of Wright &
The Wright & Kinney action for
damages for loss of their building was
the first case brought on for trial, it
being first on the calendar. It appeared
from the evidencp that at the time the
building collapsed Itenfro & Lewis
-were the agents of the plaintiffs for
the repair of their building, the repairs
being still incomplete at the time the
building fell. Renfro & Lewis were
engaged in wrecking the Goldheim
building at the time of the collapse of
the Wright & Kinney building.
The case naturally attracted con
siderable attention and aroused the
interest of those who usually concern
themselves with actions tried in the
district court# The case lasted some
thing over a week on account of the
large number of witnesses examined
and the time spent by the court in
hearing arguments on legal- proposi
tioris effecting the rights of the part

was that they were guilty of nogli
gence in underpinning the party wall
of the Goldheim and Wright & Kin
uey buildings. A second ground of
negligence was that the defendants in
excavating the basement for the Gold
heim building to a depth of three feet
did not leave a sufficient berm or
ledge immediately south of the party
wall to protect it against falling. The
evidence showed the 'underpinning un
der the party wall was about twenty
feet from the east end of the build
ing and was about five feet in length
and of the same thickness of the wall
and that the width of the berm was
throe feet wide at the top and three
andwone-half feet at the base, and ex
tended the full length'of the wall.
The plaintiffs contended that the law
governing a party wall made the de
fendants practically insurers against
any damage which might result from
injury, by the defendants, to the
Wright & Kinney building, while the
contention of the defendants was that
they could only be made liable in case

they were negligent in what they werel',er
doing upon the Goldheim property.
The court took this view and instructed
the jury that the defendants could not
be held liable unless the plaintiffs
proved the defendants were negligent
in the particulars charged by the
plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs them
selves were free frOm negligence,
which contributed to the accident. The
defendants further claimed that plain-

idated and that its own weakness was
the cause of its collapse. While the
evidence disclosed something of the
history of the improvements and the
falling of the building, the central
features of the case were about the
underpinning of the party wall and
the sufficiency of the berm which was
left along the south side of the party
wall.
The evidence of the plaintiffs to
prove negligence in placing the un
derpinning where it was located was
at most a meagre showing, while the
defendants produced a number of
competent engineers and contractors
who testified that the underpinning
was entirely proper and in harmony
with the practice of the best builders
and engineers in the country. The
same was true as to the berm or ledge
left along the south side of the party
wall. A number of experts testified
that the width and depth of tho berm
were adequate and sufficient and that
good engineering would require potli
ing more.
The court instructed the jury that
if the evidence showed the de
fendants in doing what they did were

jury that the defendant, Goldheim, had

CONTRACTS FOR 20c CUBIC YARD
Lrrcc Number of Bidders for Work—
77 Different Kinds of Bridges to
be Put in This Summer.
The hoard of supervisors held a spe
cial meeting oil, Wednesday and Thurs
day of last week to receive bids on the
bridge and road work which had beon
advertised for. Wednesday was de
voted to the road work and Thursday
to the permanent bridges and culverts.
Competition was keen among contract
ors for ,yip work to be (lone in the
county this year and tho board, to
cther with tho county engineer, are
well satisfied with the contracts as let.
On Wednesday contracts were let
for permanent grading bf a little over
thirteen miles of road in the county
road system and in all nine bids were
received. The specifications of the
wcrk called for the removing of 144,
372 cubic yards of dirt and the con
tracts let averaged a little better than
20 cents per cubic yard for the entire
amount. The bidders for' the work
were: \V. R. Shipman, Sioux City
Thos. Carey & Son, Clinton J. H. L.
Williams, Plorenco Neb. T. H. Kin
lieran, Denison: 10. J. Wilson. Council

TO. Hey. Vail: Morrison Construction
Co., Des Moines, and J. AV. Bauman,
Denison. The entire worjf was let to
two contractors, the successful ones
being Thos. Carey & Son. of Clinton,
and W. It. Shipman, of Sioux City. In
seme instances the work was not let
to the lowest bidder, but as bids were
asked for for different groups of work
and as the two successful bidders had
reservations in their estimates that
they would have to'receive a certain
amount of the work in the county at
prices they made on the work in order
to make it worth while to bring their
equipment to this county, tJie board
decided to allow them the contract.
Notwithstanding that some of the
work was let higher than other esti
mates the board saved the county con
siderable money by letting the con
tracts as they did.

Former Well Known Denison Contract
or Dies at Hospital in Silver
City, New Mexico
STOMACH TROUBLE THE CAUSE
While Residing in Denison Mr. Car*
ter Built Twenty-three Churches
in Different Parts of Iowa.
The many friends of Mr. L. .1. Car
ter were shocked to learn of his death
at Silver City, N. M„ on Sunday A
prii 16th. Mr. Carter had not been
in the best it hc#ilith)fdr several months
suffering with stomach troiible. for
which he was being treated in a hos-:
pital when death occurred.
The deceased is well known in Den
ison, having resided here for a num
ber of years, being engaged in the
contracting business. He came to
Crawford county in the year 1871, loc
ating at Denison, and living here al
most constantly until 1904, when he
moved to Silver City, N. M. Mr. Car
ter made a great success of his chos
en work, aud his reputation as an ar
chitect and builder was such' that
he was called upon to build twenty-!
seven churches at different places in
Iowa. He drew the plans and con
structed the McKiin building on east
Broadway, as well as the St. Hose of
Lima church in tho city. He was ener-
was not much in store for him in the
contracting business, he became in
terested in mines in Colorado. Leav
ing Denison in 1904, he moved to Sil
ver City where lie and his son
acquired some very valuable min
ing properties, which paid him
handsome royalties. Mrs. Carter
departed this life some three years,
ago. He leaves to mourn his death
the following children: Mrs. Louise
Brune. Mrs. Emma Ried,. Adalbert),
Theodore W., and Edward M., besides
one brother, Joseph Carter, residing
at Silver City and one sister living
in Montana.
Funeral services were held at Sil
