WASHINGTON, April IB.?President
Wilson told Congress assembled In
Joint session shortly after 1 o'clock
this afternoon he was giving Germany
irrevocable notification that the United
States will break off diplomatic relations
If its Illegal submarine campaign

was speaking. It was despatched I
last night in accordance with the president's
plan to have It before the German
government at the same moment
he was addressing the American Congress.
The president asked no action whatever
of Congress. He simply Informed
It of the accumulation o ffacts proving
that Germany's assurances to the
United States arc being violated; that
the submarine campaign, despite the
earnest protests of tho United States,
Is being conducted with renewed vigor
in contravention of all the laws of nations
and humanity and that he means
to sever relations unless It Is brought
within the law. Diplomatic history
of the world shows that such a course
la almost certain to be followed by
war.

With All His Themes the Deep
Fundamental Things of the
Word of God.
The protracted meeting continues
at the Central Christian church with
preaching by the Rev. Mr. Hawkins.
The sermons are of a high order. Mr.1
Hawkins's themes nrn th? rinnn fnn/ln
mental things of the Word of God
and are plain, pointed, strong presen-1
tations of gospel truth. His sermons
are the more striking because of the;
absence of the cheap stories so conspicuous
In the preaching of many;
popular evangelists.
The evangelist's subject last evening
was "The Word of God." He emphasized
the timeliness o fthe theme ;
by calling attention to the many evidences
of a skeptical attitude toward!
the Bible, not only by those who are
out of all church relationship, but by!
many in the church itself. In a forceful
and logical manner, he argued
that the Bible Is the Word of God;
first, because It claims to be the word
of God; second, because of its age,
certain portions of it being the oldest
literature in existence; third, because
of its subject matter: It tells
of the creation of the world, of the
creation of man, his fall, redemption.
and destiny?just such facts as we
would expect the Creator to address
to the men whom he had made: I
fourth, because of its unity and har-l
mony: It was written by forty different
authors, scattered over a per-i
iod of time embracing fifteen hundred1
years, by peasants and kings, ignorant
and learned, and yet there is such
a wonderful hnrmony and unity running
through the whole of the book
as to argue most forcefully its common
origin?God; fifth, because of its :
durability: the battles the Bible has,
fought in Its own defense, against
Paganism and ratiolalism and de-j
structlve criticism and many other'
loes. and the glorious victories that
have been achieved, argue for its divine
origin; sixth, the Influence of
the Bible wherever it has been taught
and believed was made the fitting
climax of this sermon on Christian evidences.
The transformation of the
South Sea Islands in a single generation
and the changes in social and
political conditions in all pagan lands
where it has been to any considerable
extent accepted aptly illustrate its
transforming power.
In concluding the evangelist de-.;
clared that the Bible was written either
by God or the devil; good angels
or bad angels; good men or bad j
men, as these embrace all existing
Intelligence. The devil couldn't have
written it because it points the devil
as a diabolical character. Bad angels
couldn't have written it for they are
his servants. Bad men couldn't have
written it because it condemns the
way of the wicked and exalts righteousness.
If the good wrote It they would not
falsify concerning the sources of their
information and the character of the
book.
Since every consideration precludes
the possibility of the wicked having
written it, we are forced to the conelusion
that it is what it claims to
be?God's Word?addressed to man.
"The Son of God" is the subject for
tonight.
