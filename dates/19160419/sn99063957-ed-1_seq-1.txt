The President's Message.
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 19 President YA'il
son today told congress of the dispatch
of a note to Germany that may mean
the breakinc of friendly relations witl
i that power. He spoke as follows:
"A situation has arisen in the for
eign relations of the country of whirl
it is my plain duty to Ujform you very
frankly. It will be recalled that in
February, 1915, the Imperial German
government announced its intention to
treat the waters surrounding Great Bri
tain and Ireland as embraced withir
the seat of war and destroy all mer
chant ships owned by its enemies that
might be found within any part of that
portion of the high seas and Hint it
warned all vessels of neutral, as well as
of belligerent ownership to keep out
of the waters it had thus prescribed or
else enter them at their peril. The gov
ernment of the United States earnestly
protested. It took the position that such
a policy could not be pursued without
the practical certainty of gross and pal
pable violations of the law of nations,
particularly if submarine craft were to
be employed as its instruments inas
much a the rules prescribed by that
law, rules foundeil upon principles of
humanity and established for the pro
te'tir.ii of lives of non-combatants at
s. could r it in the nature of the
case le rbsctved bv such vessels. It
based its Lrclrtt on the ground that
perons of reutral nationalities and ves
sel.? of rciitral ownership would be ei
posed to cxinuii and intolerable riskf
and tli.it no right to close any part
of tin high sea against their use or

expose them to such risks could lawful
ly be as-sorted by any belligerent gov
ernment. Tho law of nutions in these
mnttrts, upon which tho government of
the United States based its protest, is
not of recent origin or founded upon
merely arbitrary principles set up by
convention.
It is based on the contrary upon mani
fest and imperative principle of hu
manity and has long been established i
with the approval and by the express!
assent of all civilized nations.
Notwithstanding the earnest protest
of our government tho 'mperinl govern- i
inent nt once proceeded to enrry out
the policy it rud anne-wred.
Germii.y's rroati'ics Not Kept.
It expressed t l.o l:f.pi that the dan-
y.'r iiivom'c'., m iu:y nie uie uangers;
to n.;u'rnl vessels, w -.uld be reduced to J
a minimum by the instructions which1
it has issued to, its r; I marine command-j
era u'ld assured the government of the
I'nited states that it wtrj'J take every!
J'Oiisil'lo precmitiin tl.ot'i to respect
thr ri'htj i !' r. i trjls m l tn frgunrd
the lives of uon combutauts.
What has actually happened in the
yenr which has since elapsed has
shown that tho-se ho;;.-s were not justi
fied, these assurances insusceptible of
being fulfilled, in pursuance of thej
policy of submarine warfare against the j
commerce of its adversaries thus an-1
nonneed and entered upon by the im-j
periai German government iu spite of,
the solemn protest of this government, j
tho Cjminnuders of German undersea i
vessels have attacked merchant ships)
with greater and greater activity, not:
only upon the high sea aurronnding
G relit Britain and Ireland but wherever
they could encounter them, iu a way
that has grown more and more ruthbrss,
more and more indiscriminate as the
months"nave gone by, less and less ob
servant of restraints o any kind; and
have delivered their attacks without
compunction against vessels of every
nationality and bound upon every sort
of errand. Vessels of .neutral owner
ship, even vessels of neutral ownership
bound from neutral port to neutral
oort. have been destroyed alnnir with
vessels of belligerent ownership in con-'
stantly increasing numbers. (Sometimes
the merchantman attacked has been
warned and summoned to surrender be
fore being fired upon or torpedoed
sometimes passengers or crews have
been voachsafed the poor security of
being allowed to take the ships' boats
before she was ent to the bottom. But
again and again so warning has been
given, no escape even to the ship's
boats allowed to those on board.
Violates All Laws.
"What the government foresaw
would happen has happened. Tragedy
has followed tragedy on the seas in
such fashion, with such attendant cir
cumstances as to make grossly evident
that warfare of -such a Bort, if warfare
it be, cannot be carried on without the
most palpable violation of the dictates
alike of right and of humanity. Whnt-
j ever the disposition and intention of the
Imperial German government it has
manifestly proved impossible for it to
keep up such methods of nttnek upon
Press Association.
tho conimerco of its enemies within the
bounds set by either by the reuson or
the heart of mankind,
"In February of the present year tho
Imperial German government informed
this government mid the other neutral
governments of the world that it had
reason to believe that the government
of Great Britain had arined all mer
chant vessels of British ownership and
had given tlieni secret orders to attack
any submarine of the enemy they might
encounter upon tho seas mid that the
Imperial German government felt justi
fied in the circumstances in treating
all armed merchantmen of belligerent
ownership as auxiliary vessels of war,
which it would have the right to de
stroy without warning. The law of na
tions has long recognized the right of
merchantmen to carry arms for protec
tion to use them to repel attack, though
to use them in such circumstances, at
their own risk, but the Imperial Ger
man government claimed the right to
set these understandings aside in cir
cumstances which it deemed extraordin
ary. Kven the terms in which it an
nounced its purposo thus still further
to relax the restraint it had previously
professed its willingness and desire to
put upon the operations of its subma
rines carried the plain implication that
at lenst vessels which were not armed
would still be exempt from destruction
without warning and that personal safe
ty would be accorded their passengers
and crews; but even that limitation, if
it was ever practicable to observe it,
has in fact constituted no check nt e1
upon the destruction of ships of every
sort.
All Assurances Disregarded.
"Aguiu and again the Imperial Ger
man government has given this govern
ment its no I inn assurance that at lenst
passenger snips would not be thus dei.t
with, and yet it has again and nguri
permitted its undersea conmanders :
disregard those assurances with eutirj
impunity. Great liners like the Lusi
tania and Arabic and mere ferry boat.
like the Sussex have been attacked
without a moment's warning, sometimes
before they had even become aware
that they were in the presence of an
armed vessel of the enemy and the lives
of non-combatants, pajjciigais an'!
crews have been sacrificed nholeii-, in
a mnnner which the gove nment of the
United States cannot but regard nt
wnnton and without tie ji;ht" color
or justification. No limit of any kind,

STORM OF APPLAUSE
WHEN STATEMENT ENDS
Dead Silence Reigned As
Causes Leading To Act
Were Enumerated
Washington, April 19 A brilliant
audienco heard President Wilson's mes
sage to congress today regarding rela
tions with Ciermiuy. The diplomatic;
and cabinet galleries wero crowded and
few members or the houso and senate
failed to have their families present.
Long before the president arrived at
tho capital, crowds were jostling for
standing space iu the halls outside ths
gallery doors. Heprcsentativo Kchall,
tho blind Alinnesotan, was tho first
member, on the floor. ATter a pige hail
led him to ins sent, he sut in solitude
for more than liulf mi hour.
Congressmen, eager to learn the pres
ident's course, surrounded Representa
tives Flood and Cooper of the hous
foreign relations comiuitteo. Republi
cans criticised tho president for not
consulting the republicans until his
message to Germany had been dis
patched. Cooper expressed diss itisfac-
t ion at tho president's course in thi
respect.
To guard the executive, ovcry availa
ble member of the cnpitol police force
was on duty. They guarded every door,
and thoso witiiout tickets wero not ad
mitted.
The president was grave and earnest
as ho spoke. Members of congress and
thoso in tho crowded tileries scarcely
stirred until ho had finished. No ap
plause interrupted him.
A full minute utter he had ceased a
brief storm of applause broke, members
on the floor and the gnllery spectators
participating. A "rcncl yell," given,
when he entered the chamber, was not
repotted. At the noight ot the cheer
ing, President Wilson stepped from the
speaker's .plutfonn and depurted from
tho chamber. To entered uu automobile
and was driven directly to tho White
House.
The executive made no request ot
congress, lie simply fulfilled his prom
ise to advise congress in ease he took
action such as lie was reported to huve
ttken.
After the address, tho senators re
turned to their chamber and the house
resumed consideration of tiic agricul
tural bill.
"It was a hypocritical speech," said;
Representative Mann, "probably in
tend for cnmpuigii purposes. The pres
ident has been pro l.uglish all tlirougli
the controversy. I siid at the time ot
I lie Mel, colore resolution that the presi
dent wanted to get us into a war with.
Germany, and 1 sny the same t'iin
now."
" If tho contents of the message wore
io bo the basis fur a declaration of war
by congress, I would not vote for war,"
said Senitor Sherman.
"I don't believe Americans shouKt
travel on belligerent vessels," said Sen
ator Jones of Washington. " If they do
1 hope those travelers will be tho first
to enlist if wnr comes. The American
people would never approve war on the
grounds named. ' '
"Thero is nothing iu tiie message
lending to war," said Soiutor Chamber
lain. Germans interpreted tho president's
message not to request abandonment off
tlio submarine campaign. They tnoughr.
it called for guarantees similar to those
which Germany gave with regard to itsj
U-boat operations in the Mediterranean.
Germans believe that if the United.
States enters the war it will b pro
