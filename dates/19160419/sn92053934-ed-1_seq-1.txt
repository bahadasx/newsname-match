Washington. April 19. Major
General Hngh L. Scott, chief of
staff of the army, -will go to San
Antonio, Texas, tonight hy order
of Secretary Baker in order to pet
accurate information as to the sit
uation on the border and in Mex
ico. Secretary Baker Issued this state
ment:
"General Scott leaves for San An
tonio this evening at 6:15 at my re
guest. He will sp?nd several days
with General Funston and return. This
trip is made solely for the purpose
of getting as accurate information a3
Is possible for the u?e of the depart
ment. General Funston remains in
full charge of the affairs of his de
partment Including the expedition in
to Mexico. He has the full confidence
of the department and his dispositions
have the department's entire ap
proval." May Determine Coorse.
Secretary Baker would not discuss
General Scott's mission- beyond bis
formal statement It was assumed,
however, that his report after confer
ence with General Funston will go
far toward determining the course to
be pursued in Mexico.
It is known that General Funston
has been urging the department that
he be permitted to shift his head
quarters and the border base in order
to shorten his line of communications.
The department apparently has
hesitated to authorize any radical
change in the status of the expedition,
in the face of requests from General
Carranza that the troops be recalled,
believing it might tend to Increase
anti-American feeling among Carranza
garrisons. For the same reason the
sending of heavy reinforcements to
the border has not been resorted to as
yet.
Mexico Situation In Doubt.
Until the German situation is clear
ly understood it 1b impossible to fore
cast the administration's decision as
to I'erFhiiig's expedition. Military
observers appear to agree that some
radical move must be made soon
either to back up the troops in Mexico
or to withdraw them.
General Scott is acquainted with
Villa and with many Carranza offi
cials arid with his knowledge of the
border and the confidential informa
tion General Funston is able to supply
he will be able to advise Secretary
Baker.
Confirm Concentration Report
Confirmation of the reports that the
American expeditionary force was be
ing concentrated at three points in
Mexico preparatory eitlier for the
withdrawal of the troops or the organ
ization of a new and more extensive
campaign was received here today from
Mexican eources.
It was said that General Pershing
tad withdrawn all outlying detach
ments south of Namiquipa and that in
the neighborhood of 3,000 men were
camped at San Antonio, 12 miles west
of Cusihuiriachic, and that a force esti
mated at almost double this number
was being concentrated near Nami
quipa. Troops to Withdraw.
The belief that the American troops
are about to leave Mexico is widespread
among the Mexicans in Juarez and has
completely changed the attitude of the
people, who after the Parral incident
lave marked indications of hostility
toward Americans.

Senate Vote
Passes Army
Bill in Rush
"Washington, April 19. An army re
organization bill that would produce
regular army and . reserve military
forces in the United States aggregat
ing a million men was passed by the
senate last night without a record
vote. It is a substitute for the Hay
bill passed by the house, and the dif
ferences will be worked out in con
ference. On the eve of a Joint session of
both houses of congress to hear a
message from the president on grave
International issues the senate has
tened completion of the bill amid
scenes of excitement, repeatedly re
jecting all amendments pending to re
duce the proposed strengthening of
the army.
Bound by an agreement to take a
final vote on the army reorganization
bill before adjournment, the senate
settled down last night for a pro
tracted session. One important amend
ment was passed late in the day fix
ing the peace strength of the standing
army at 250,000.
The amendment making the army's
peace strength 250,000 instead of 180,
000, as provided in the bill as framed
by the military committee, was adopt
ed, 43 to 37, 22 republicans and 21
democrats voting for it. A proposal
to make the figure 150,000 previously
had been rejected, 66 to 13. A peace
strength of only 140,000 is provided
for the army bill passed by the house
and a sharp contest over that feature
is looked for in conference.
THE WAR TODAY
The Russians have captured

men.

New York, April 19. The papers
seized bv fo.detal ai;f;nts yesterday, in i
the' office of Woife von Igel, former
secretary of Captain Franz von Pa
pen, recalled German attache, will not
be restored, neither will the prosecu
tion of von Igel, for his alleged par
ticipation in the Wetland canal plot,
be dropped, Assistant United States
Attorney Roger B. Woods said today.
Mr. Wood announced he had received
instructions from Washington to pro
ceed with the case Just as if no pro
test had been made. The prosecutor
said he had examined the papers over
night, that they all referred to the
alleged conspiracy to destroy the Ca
nadian waterway, and that there was
no evidence that they were ambassa
dorial papers. The papers, he said,
furnished additional evidence against
the five men under indictment In the
case.
District Attorney Marshall said that
in addition to the papers seized bear
ing upon the Welland canal plot there
was also documentary evidence taken
"of extraordinary importance," dis
closing other activities in the so-called
German propaganda in this coun
try. Mr. Marshall said the question at is
sue was whether von Igel was a mem
ber of the German embassy staff at
the time of the alleged crime. Inves
tigation had disclosed, he said, that
the man did not become a member of
the staff until December, 1915, more
than a vear after the Welland canal
plot was hatched.

Declares Relations Will Be

Alter Policy.
Washington, April 19. Presi
dent Wilson told congress, as
sembled in joint session shortly
after 1 'clock this afternoon, he
had given Germany Irrevocable
notification that the Tnlted Stales
will break off diplomatic relations .
if her illegal submarine campaign
is continued.
A note, America's last word,
practically an ultima turn and de
manding an Immediate reply pre
sumably was in the Berlin for
eign office as the president was
speaking.
" The president asked no action
whatever of congress. He simply
Informed it of the accumulation of
facts proving1 that Germany's as
surances to the United States are
being Tiolated; that the subma
rine campaign, despite the earnest
protests of the United States is
being conducted with renewed
vigor in contravention of all the
laws of nations and humanity and
that he means to sever relations,
unless It Is brought within the
law. Diplomatic history of the
world shows that such a course
is almost certain to be followed by
war.
The presidents note and his
address to congress are final.
They mark the end of diplomatic
exchanges. A continuance of the
long standing friendly relations,
the president made clear, depends
alone on Germany's conduct.
REVIEW GERMAN DECLARATION.
The president said:
"Gentlemen of the congress:
"A situation has arisen in the for
eign relations of the country of which
it is my plain duty to inform you very
frankly.
'It will be recalled that in Febru
ary, 1916, the imperial German gov
ernment announced its intention to
treat the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland as embraced with
in the seat of war and to destroy all
merchant ships owned by its enemies
that might be found within any part
of that portion of the high seas and
that it warned all vessels of neutral
as well as of belligerent ownership,
to keep out of the waters it had thus
prescribed or else enter them at their
peril. The government of the United
States earnestly protested. It took
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without the practical
certainty of gross and palpable viola
tions of the law of nations, particular
ly if submarine craft were to be em
ployed as its Instruments, inasmuch
as the rules prescribed by that law,
rules founded upon principles of hu
manity and established for the pro
tection of the lives of non-combatants
at sea, could not in the nature of the
case be observed by such vessels. It
based its protest on th ground that
persons of neutral nationality and ves
sels of neutral ownership would be
exposed to extreme and intolerable
risks and that no right to close any
part of the high seas against their
use or to expose them to such risks
could lawfully be asserted by any
belligerent government. The law of
nations in these waters, upon which
the government of the United States
based Its protest. Is not of recent
origin or founded upon merely arbi
trary principles set up by convention.
It is based, on the contrary, upon
manifest and imperative principles of
humanity and has long been establish
ed with the approval and by the ex
press assent of all civilized nations.
Disregarded V. S. Protest.
"Notwithstanding the earnest pro
test of our government, the Imperial
German government at once proceeded

SEWDS ULTHATIH
WILSONISMS
If the imperial German govern
ment intends to continue its pur
pose to prosecute relentless and
indiscriminate warfare the United
ed States Is forced to the conclus
ion that there Is but one course to
pursue.
Tnless the German government
should now Immediately declare
and effect an abandonment of its
present methods of warfare
against passenger and freight car
rying vessels, this government
has no choice but to sever diplo
matic relations.
This decision I have arrived at
with the keenest regret. The pos
sibility of the action contemplated,
I am sure all thnnghtM Ameri
cans will look forward to with un
affected reluctance.
It pnts the next move np to
Germany and does not necessarily
mean a break.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Washington, April 19. President
Wilson has sent the note to Ger
many warning her that unless
attacks on merchantmen carrying
Americans In violation of Interna
tional law are stopped diplomatic re
lations will be severed.
The president reviewed this to Sen
ators Stone and Lodge and Represen
tatives Flood and Cooper, ranking re
publicans and democrats of the con
gressional committee, in a conference
at the White house early today.
The president In his address to con
gress at 1 p. m. today will reveal
fully what he has told Germany. The
note and his address, the congres
sional leaders said, contains the plain
statement that the alternative is the
breaking off of friendly relations.
Note an Ultimatum.
The president explained that ths
note practically is an ultimatum, but
does not contain a time limit. A de
mand is made, however, that Germany
reply Immediately.
The president went over the situa
tion very thoroughly with the com
mittee leaders and told them explicit
ly he believed the United States could
not remain on friendly terms with
Germany if American lives continued
to be placed in jeopardy by German
submarines. He laid before them all
information he will convey in his ad
dress to congress. The demand for h
stop to Illegal warfare, the president
told the leaders, is unequivocal. As
the committeemen left the White
house they made no effort to conceal
what the president had told them.
Will Give Germany a Chance.
The president made It plain, how
ever, that if Germany still cares to
continue her submarine warfare in
accordance with the accepted rules of
international law, the American gov
ernment will be glad to continue
friendly relations. It was disclosed
that the president in his address to
congress will not go into extended de
tail about the incidents which have
caused the American government to
view the situation with such gravity.
The president takes it for granted that
members of congress are familiar
with them.
Sent Last Night
The note went forward last night la
t code
by way of Copenhagen. The
president wants it to be in the hands
of Ambassador Gerard or the German
foreign office when he appears before
congress.
The members who heard the presi
dent outline it did not understand it
to be an ultimatum In the sense that
the term is technically used, but all
considered it to have that effect.
Senator Lodge asked the president
about the use of the word "ImmedK
ately" in that connection, and was
told that it meant that Germany
should be given an opportunity to re
ceive the communication and to make
reply.
The evidence in the Sussex case
was referred to and the president
pointed out the apparent similarity In
the accounts of the time and place or
the attack upon her and the attack
admitted by Germany to have been
made by one of her submarines on a
ship in that, vicinity. The president
