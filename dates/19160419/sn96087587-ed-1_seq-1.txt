Basket ball should bo Imrnd
from any local contest H3 the
game takes too much time. The
people can attend a basket ball
game most any time of the year,
but the races come only once a
year and tho people cntne out tc
euu them and not basket ball.
x The process of district elimi
nation is not right, livery school
should bo given a fair chance at
the county content. Thruo or
four contests could be conductod
nt the same timo in different
roonia and thus shorten the pro
gram. Ono who gets second in
a distriot contest might get sec
