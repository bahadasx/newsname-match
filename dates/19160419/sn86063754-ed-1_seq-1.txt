Not Captured.
John Mcllwain, the negro who
is wanted in Lancaster for killing
a white man last fall, has
been harbored on Mr. A. F. Fun
derburk's farm five miles west of
Pageland by Walker Edgeworth
since Mcllwain's escape from
the officers who had arrested
liim several weeks ago. Edgeworth
lives only a few miles
from where Mcllwain escaped,
and near a large body of woods.
Searching parties found Mcllwain's
bed in an old Dine ton
about a quarter of a mile from
Edgeworth's house Saturday, but
the negro had gone earlier in
the day or perhaps the night before.
It had been known for several
davs that Mcllwain was hiding
on this farm but it had proven a
very difficult task to trap him.
It was known that he was being
fed by Edgeworth, and plans had
been made for his capture on
Saturday night. Edgeworth
"smelt a mouse" on Friday, and
wrote a note to the fugitive
warning him to flee, but later, it
seems, he saw him in person
and the note was never found.
Saturday about noon when it
made known that Mcllwain was
gone or going. Sheriffs Douglass
and Hunter, Policemen Grant
and Douglass and a hundred or
two citizens were notified and a
search was begun. All the afternoon
and well into the night the
woods, houses and roads were
watched, but the negro was not
found. Edgeworth had left
home Saturday morning to go to
Clem Robinson's to buy a cow,
according to his story, and at
Clem's he was found in the
afternoon and taken back to the
crowd of searchers to give an account
of his conduct. He denied
at first, but when told of the pen
dltv r?f nn? l/.i"' *

for his own crime, he loosened
up a bit and led the searchers to
the bed in the woods and showed
them the note he had left
there for Mcllwain. He denied
knowing where he was then,
however, and his tale did little
toward locating the murderer.
Steve Seegars was arrested also
on a charge of the same nature,
and acknowledged that he had

gro, and that he had known that
the negro was hiding in that
section.
Remus Gregory, the negro
who was alleged to have aided
Mcllwam to escape a few weeks
ago, was arrested and was handniffprl

bile when a sack was pulled
down over his head by parties
from behind, and he was dragged
out and into awaiting car.
Then ensued a race for some
distance, during which a rope
was put around the negro's neck,
and a little later he was taken
out and was being pulled up to
a limb when the sheriff rushed
up and with a drawn pistol took
the prisoner away. Gregory was
carried to jail Sunday afternoon
bv Sheriff Douglass.
The reward for Mellwain's
capture is now three hundred

Will Withdraw
Washington, April 16.?American
troops will be withdrawn
from Mexico if Francisco Villa
is dead. Administration officials
made this unqualified state
ment tonight, commenting on
reports from Mexican sources
that the bandit's body had been
discovered and was being taken
to Chihuahua City by special
train.
The State and War Departments
were without confirmatory
advices on the subject from
American sources. Reports
reaching El Paso and other border
points were forwarded for
information, but neither American
consul nor military authorities
in Mexico were heard from.
Every message received was
closely scrutinized at the State
Department and sent to the
White House. In some quarters
there was a disposition to credit
them, despite the fact that border
reports generally have been
viewed with much suspicion
since the pursuit began.
It is certain that everv effort
will be made to obtain so complete
an identification as to
make sure beyond a reasonable
doubt that the man who waged
war with a few hundred bandits
against the United States and
the de facto Government of
Mexico simultaneously, has Daid
the penalty.
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua
should be able to make the
identification.
Custom Collector Cobb at El
Paso informed the State Department
late today, that Mexican
customs officials at Jaurez had
told him the body of the bandit
had been found and would be
taken tonight to Chihuahua
Citv.
Biddy Broke Up the Meetin'
Monroe Enquirer.
The colored people were having
their school closing last Saturday
night at Gordonsville in
West Monroe township, ColtimhtiR
Prpcsnn (tic Joanhor ? <??
?? _ itiv ivav&ivi f '"' AO
at a table reading the program
when something that was not on
the program took place. Biddv
Hood, who lived not far from
the school house, tanked up on
moonshine liquor, which had
three or four fights per ounce in
it, and walked into the church
where the entertainment was being
held, took the lamp off of
the table at which the teacher
was presiding, put it down on
the floor and sat down beside it,
drew a large pistol and snapped
it three times, then tore up the
costumes and other property
used by the students in pulling
off their closing exercises. The
audience went out and left Biddy,
the teacher and some of the
trustees of the church. The
teacher and trustees overpowered
the wild man of Gordonville
and took his pistol from him.
Warrants have been sworn out
for the wild Biddy, and the arresting
officer who has them
wants to know "where Biddy is
at."

County. The bale was hauled
on a small roadster, the top being
taken off to make room for
it.
This was the first bale of cotton

No Filth; No Flies.
Investigators tell us that houseflies
are usually horn within M)0
to 500 feet of the place where
you see them. They do not fly
far, so the breeding place is not
hard to find. The slogan "Swat
the fly" has resulted in a large
amount of good all over the country,
but a better slogan is "Starve
