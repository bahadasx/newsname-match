, That Columbia will he connected by
rail In a very few months Is the uni
versal opinion, and every man who can
work is put ling in his time in secur
ing" obligations to meet the demands
-of Adair county The county is re
quired to donate $50,000.. Fifty thou
sand dollars fs a large sum to raise, but
ur people are determined in their ft
forts.-4 They know what a railroad
would mean for Adair county, especial
ly to the.faru.inu class, and tbey are
united in their efforts to secure the
fall amount
Thirty-two thousand of the fifty
thousand has been subscribed, leaving
a balance of eigreen thousand to be'
raised
Every person who is interested iu
the deve'opment of Adair county
should give according to his capacity
. to nay. A dollar given away now
means xo unng in uiousanas in me
future. It will be harder to raise the
'eighteen thousand than it was to se
cure the thirty-two thousand, but
with the names of those who have
promised to help, we believe that the
fifty thousand dollars will be made up
bf Saturday night
This is not the time for doubting
TEkamases. Our people know that the
Ttci"wlll be built'if-AdaSr comes up to
the requirements. You men, who
iiave got money, and want to increase
your wealth, should no longerhesltate.
Do not wait for liberal men to double
their subscriptions in order that you
may be benefitted by their liberality,
but subscribe what your conscience
plainly 'tells yofl. You know the value
of a railroad. Do your duty and your
children and grandchildren will rise
up and call you blessed.
Everybody's going to have "The
Time of Ilis Life" next Friday night,
at Lindsey-Wilson. Don't fail to be
there. Admission 15 and 25 cents.
Next Saturday at one o'clock, in
the court-house, is the hour set for a
windup of our effort to get a railroad
and every one who wants to -gee the
present proposition win must be pres
ent. The subscriptions up to that
hour will be announced and if you want
the road and have nob given, j ou should
be present to contribute, if you have
given and willing to do more rather
than lose, this is your last chance
There is no reason not to be present
No one can make you do any more and
no one will try to do it. We had bet
ter all be present and win or go down.
in an honest effort.
The meeting at the Methodist
Church, grows in interest, largVcon
gregations being present at the .eve
ning services. Rev. Wagoner,, is
preaching convincing sermons, and
the unconverted are paying close at
tention The song service, led by
Prof. Smith, is inspiring and his solos
have been greatly enjoyed. His voice
Is soft, but his words are clear and
melodious- There were twelve addi
tions to the church Sunday forenoon.
The -meeting will probably continue
until the middle of this week.
Nell & Son's bottling plant was
started last week. It is an interest
ing sight to see the machinery, all
new, in motion. The art of bottling
the drink is surprising, so rapidly is it
done. The plant is now doing a good
business, orders coming in daily. The
warmer the weather, the better the
"business, and the indications now
point tp a busy plant all the summer,
Mr. Guy Nell is the manufacturer.
Mr. W. E. McCandless, of the firm
of McCandless & Reed, bottlers, was
here From Lebanon last week He

Work on Manford Road.
Considerafile criticism has been in
dulged in concerning the road work on
the Stanford road, but most of it
comes from an improper understand
ing of the real conditions and efforts
employed to accomplish the building
of the most road for the least amount
of money. We have heard a number
predict that not 'more than two or
three miles would be built with the
money appropriated for the work.
Such predictions are founded on fears
rather than facts, and doubtless
prompted by impatience for the work,
to proceed rapidly, rather than wait
for favorable weather conditions. If
we mistake not, the work, active and
energetic will soon be under headway,
and the people will become not only
well pleased, but elated pver the re
sults. Mr. Stmts, foremen from town
to the creek, will soon have his part of
the work completed. From the creek
on, Mr J N. Coffey will become the
manager and will organize a force
strong and capable to make the work
hum. Mr. Kennedy, State road engi
neer, is here and at his post of duty,
and there will be no let up in the
work except that forced by bad weath
er. When the money has been spent,
when a substantial road of four or five
miles has heea left as evidence of its
spending, we predict that the people
will be well pleased, and so much so,
that this county will never again per
mit the work of road building tocease.

The people of Adair county are en
thused over the prospects of se
curing the building of a railroad from
some .point on the L. & N. to
this place. The starting point has
not been determined, but it will
either be Campbellsviile, Greensburg
or from a point between the two
places. Adair county will meet the
demands of the company, and is as
sured that if she does the road will be
built. There are no doubting men
in the county, every man is alive,
and there is not a doubt but we will
get the road, and that.it vvill be con
structed as quickly as money and men
can make it a go..

I have recently finished my second

involved a travel of eight hundred
and ninety-five miles. 'Most or the
time the weather has beenfvery bad,
much high water, muddy road, but I
was able to meet all my engagements

interests the first quarter. There
have been one hundred and forty-five
conversions and sixty-nine" additions
to the church. I have baptized eight
infants. s-
We are planning to build a new
parsonage on the Mill Springs charge,
are looking toward a parsonage at Al
bany. We have leceived donations
for Pafestine and Oak Grove churches,
which pay them out of debt. ' The
Palestine church is a neat, attractive
little house of worship. The Oak
Grove church-when completed -will be
the nicest and most attractive house
of worship in that part of the coun
try. We have secured a donation of
one hundred dollars for Atwood church
which will put them out of debt, and
on better footing. Improvements
have been made on other churches,
and some parsonages have been re
paired. Payments are being made on
our Columbia parsonage. Subscript
ions are being taken for the District
parsonage. Our people at Jamestown
are bu'lding a church and hope to
have ic ready for the District Confer
ence, which will be held in. that town,
June 8-11. Our newly modeled and
beautiful church at Elkhorri will be
opened the third Sunday in May.
The sermon will be preached by Dr.

An exciting and very close game of
base ball was played at this place last
Saturday afternoon, the contesting
clubs being St. Mary's vs. the Lindsey
Wiison. Both teams were in fine shape
and the playing was worth seeing from
start to finish, the teams seemingly to
be evenly matched. Burley Young
pitched for the home team and Leon
Lewis was hehind the bat. A specticu
larplay by Young won the game.
There were three home men on bases,
two being out, Young- went to the
bat, knocked the ball out qf sight,
bringing in all three and got to third
base himself. ' The yelling was terrific.
The game closed, the score standing 4
for LindseyvWilson and 2 for St.
Mary's The day before St. Mary's
defeated Campbellsviile 7 to nothing.
A Card of Thanks.
I wish to express my heartfelt
thanks to my neighbors and friends
in and around Glensfork for.the kind
ness, help and sympathy hhown to us
during the sickness of my beloved fa
ther. J. F. Abrel.
Next Saturday is the day set to
make our last and supreme effort. If
we fail that day the railroad proposi
tion is dead. There will not be and
should not be another day. If the
people are in earnest about raising the
S50,000, let them come and see the
success or failure of it. It is notNthe
time to let others come, but tc come
yourself and help. Only a joint ef
fort will win.

Chicago, 111., Apr. 15, 1916.
Dear Mr. Harris:
The current issue of the News just
arrived tells of another opportunity
for Adair Countv to get a railroad,
and I have wired you that I would be
glad to subscribe 850 00 to the required
bonus fund, which I am pleased to
confirm.
I trust most sincerely that the cit
izens of the county will not let this
opportunity pass to procure a railroad
for the county. Undoubtedly if the
proposition submitted is a practical
one and I take it that it is the cit
izens would make a great mistake
should they fail to take advantage of
the same.
With personal regards, I am
Yours very truly,

Miss Emma Bailey Married.
On Wednesday, April the 5th, Miss
Emma Bailey, daughter of Mr. Willis
Bailey, of near Columbia, and Mr. S.
A. Vest, of Mount Pleasant, Tenn.,
were married in Nashville. Miss Bai
ley formerly lived here where she is
known and appreciated for her Chris
tian virtues exemplified in a most
amiable disposition and high ideals of
living.- Some few years ago she went
to Nashville and became a trained
nurse' in which calling her services
were sought by the wealthier people
which resulted in a rapid financial ad
vancement as well as a high apprecia
tion of her skill as a nurse and her
accomplishments as a lady. From
published reports in the papers of
Nashville and Mt. Pleasant, Mr. Vest
is a young gentleman who stands high
in the esteem of a large cicle of mid
dle Tennesseeans, and a chemist of
good report with inklings afloat that
he may, later on, serve his district in
Congress. Knowing the bride as we
do, and accepting the introduction of
the groom from his home publication,
we"feel that each has, in reality, drawn
a capital prize of precious value to,,
adorn and enrich their f utureV'and
with hp.arr.v nnnorat-nlaHnns wish
them a most prosperous, happy,1 use- "" "
