President's Note and Address to Congress Final and Mark End
5 of Diplomatic Exchanges Next Move Depends Alone
Upon Germany's Conduct Great Crowd Listens to
i President's Speech in Intense Silence.
Washington, April 19. President
.' Wilson told congress, assembled In
:. joint session shortly after 1 o'clock
this afternoon, he had given Germany
:i Irrevocable notification that the Unit
? ed States will break off diplomatic re
i latlons If her Illegal submarine cam
i paign is continued.
;J' A note, America's last word, prac-
tically an ultimatum, and demanding
? an Immediate reply, presumably was
'! in the Berlin foreign office as the
j president was speaking. It was die
; patched last night in accordinco with
'. the )resident's plnn to have It before
.' the German government at the same
moment ho was addressing the Amer-
3 can congress.
i President Explains to Congress.
The president asked no action what
ever of congress. He simply Informed
J , It of the accumulation of tacts prov-
ing that Germany's assurances to the
r United States are being violated; that
. the submarine campaign, despite the
'i earnest protests of the United States,
I Is bPlng conducted with renewed vigor
' in contravention of all the laws of
I nations and humanity and that he
: means to sever relations unless It is
brought within the law. Diplomatic
i hlstorv of the world shows that such
a course Is almost certain to be fol-
' lowed bv war.
, Note Is Final.
The president's note and his address
- to congress aro final. They mark
J the end of diplomatic exchanges. A
P continuance of the long standing
t friendly relations, the president made
1 clear, depends alone upon Germans
7 conduct. , , ,
Representatives of the allied coun-
tries filled the diplomatic galleries of
'j the house. Women ruled In the pub
v, lie galleries, less than twenty men
finding places In the six hundred
I seats. Mrs. Wilson was in the execu-
j tive gallery. t
i In the cttblnet party were secrotar-
i ies LanBing, Baker, Houston and
I Wilson, Attorney General Gregory and
i Postmaster General Burleson. The
? vice president and secretaries arrived
1 at 12:50 and marched In double file
( down the center aisle, members of
' the house rising and remaining stand-
lng unUl they were seated. .
$ While the secretaries were taking
their seats, Mr. Wilson reached the
capltol and waited in Speaker Clark s
j office just outside the chamber As
$ the president entered the chamber,
J just before 1 o'clock, senators, repro
!l sentatlves. cabinet and galleries rose.

of the German submarine campaign
there was no demonstration to punc

, Every head bowed forward as the
, president Indicated that ho was 'W

It was 1:14 o'clock when the pres
ident concluded. He had spoken Just
fifteen minutes. Applause started
from the Democratic side and the Re
publican members then joined. Dem
ocrats began rising to their feet and
soon the entire assemblage was
standing. The applause lasted per
haps a minnte. and then as the presi
dent passed out of the chamber, died
away.
Speaker Clark declared the joint
session at an end, and the senators
filed out. The galleries quickly were
deserted. Speaker Clark referred the
nddreso to the foreign affairs com
mittee and the house resumed Its reg
ular business.
Washington, April 1.9. President
Wilson has sent the note to Germany
warning her that unless attacks on
merchantmen, carrying Americans, in
violation of International law are
stopped, diplomatic relations -will be
severed. The president explained
that the note practically 1b an ulti
matum but doeB not contain a time
limit. A demand Is made, however,
that Germany reply immediately.
The president went over the situa
tion very thoroughly with the com
mittee leaders and told them explicit
ly he believed the United StateB could
not remain on friondly terms with
Germany If American lives continue
to be placed In jeopardy by German
submarines. He laid before them all
information he will convoy In his ad
dress to congress. The demand for a
stop to Illegal submarine warfare, the
president told the leaders, is unequi
vocal. As the committeemen left the
White House they made no effort to
conceal what the president had told
them.
It was disclosed that the president
in his address to congress will not
go into extended detail about the In
cidents which have caused the Amer
ican government to view the situa
tion with such gravity as he takea
for granted that members of congress
are familiar with them.
Night Message Sent.
The note went forward last night
in code by way of Copenhagen. The
president wants It to be in the hands
of Ambassador Gerard, or the German
foreign office when he appears before
congress. The members who heard
the President outline it, did not un
derstand it to be an ultimatum, In the
sense that the term Is technically
used, but all considered It to have
that effect
Lodge Asks Questions.
Senator Lodge asked the president
about the use of the word "Immedi
ately" in that connection and was told
that it meant that Germany should
be glvon an opportunity to receive
the communication and to mako re
ply The evidence In the Sussex cose
was referred to and the president
pointed out 'the apparent similarity
in the accounts of the time and place
of the attack upon her and the attack
admitted by Germany to have been
made by one of her submarines on a
ship in that vicinity. The president
believes the evidence in the Subbox
1 case Is convincing.
Next Move Up to Germany.
"The address is a very strong one
1 and the note is a strong one," said
Senator Stone after the White House
conference. "It puts the next move
: up to Germany and will bring diplo-
' matic correspondence to a close. It
doeB not necessarily mean a break.
t It demands that Germany modify her
i method of submarine warfare and is
the last word to bo said by this gov
t ernment on the subject.
"The president does not ask con-
gress to do anything. After the mes-
- sage is read, and when I have re--
turned to the senate, I shall move
i that the president's address be prin-
ted and referred to the foreign rela-
- tions committee for consideration."
1 The president, it became known takes
c the position that he Is contending not
3 for America alone, but for all neu
tral nations and their rights.
y president Addresses Congress.
The president Bald:
"Gentlomeu of the congress.
"A situation M arisen In thACpr
elgn relations of the country of whioh
It 1b my plain duty to inform you
very frankly.
"It will bo recalled that In Febru
ary, 1915, the Imperial German gov
ernment announced Its Intention to
treat the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland as embraced with
in the seat of warand to destroy all
merchant ships owned by its enemies
that might be found within any part
of that portion of the high seas, and
that It warned all vessels of neutral
as well as of belligerent ownership
to keep out of the waters it had thus
proscribed or else enter them at their
peril. The government of the United
States earnestly protested. It took
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without the practical
certainty of gross and palpable viola
tion of the law of nations, particular
ly if submarine craft were to be em-"1
ployed as its instruments, inasmuch
as the rules prescribed by that law,
niles founded upon principles of hu
manity and established for the pro
tection of the lives of non-combatants
at sea, could not, in the nature
of the case, be observed by such ves
sels. It basefl Its protest on the
ground that persons of neutral na
tionality and vessels of neutral own
ership would be exposed to extreme
and intolerable risks, and that no
'right to close anypart of the high
seas against their use or to expose
them to such riBks could lawfully be
asserted by any belligerent govern
ment. The law' of nations in these
matters upon which tho government
of the United States based its pro
tost is not of recent origin or found
ed upoji merely arbitrary principles
set up by convention. It is based, on
the contrary, upon manifest and im
perative principles of humanity and
has long beon established with the
approval and by the express assent
of all civilized, nations.
German's Continue Violations.
"Notwithstanding the earnest pro
test cf our government, the Imperial
German government at once proceed
ed to carry out the policy it had an
nounced. It expressed the hope that
the dangers involved, at any rate the
dangers to neutral vessels, would be
reduced to a minimum by the Instruc
tions which it had issued to Us sub
marine commanders and assured the
government of the United States that
it would take every possible precau
tion both to respect the rights of neu
trals and to (safeguard tho lives of
noncombatants!

Note Gross Exaggeration.
Washington, April 19. "I do not
believe the president's course will
lead to war," said Sonator Chamber
lain, Democrat, chairman of tho mili
tary committee.
"I think tho president was fully Jus
tified m the course he has taken said
Senator Wadsworth, Republican of
New York.
"If war comes out of this," declar
ed Sonator Kenyon, Republican of
Iowa, "I hope the first to enlist will

Speaker Clark and Democratic Lead
er Kitchin declined to comment on
tho address.
"Tho sending of a note to Germany
was as mild a position as tho presi
dent could take," said Representative
Flood, chairman of the foreign af
fairs committee.
President Never Neutral.
"I think this government should be
neutral," said Republican Leader
Mann. "The president never has been
neutral. Pic has been on the English
side all the time. What he said about
Germany, while it iHgrossly exagger
ated, is a just complaint. But he could
say just tho same about England and
our shipping, substituting 'seizing
ships' for 'sinking ships.' It is a mis
take to break off diplomatic relations
with Germany. That Is simply to
quit In a pet. It Is perfectly evident
that the president, as a campaign pol
icy dodge, is trying to work up to a
point where he can get Into a war
with Germany during a presidential
campaign "
"The president's position Is a com
plete repudiation of his noto of Jan.

regarding the arming of merchant ves

Representative Cooper, ranking Re
publican member of the foreign af

"This Is a good time for overy one

fice. He contended that, even If the
alleged crime was committed prior to
von Igel's appointment, ho necessarily
was a subordinate to von Papen and
that as the latter had been sent homo
for his qlleged activities, no blame
should attach to von Igel.

great importance on the return of
the papers. It is understood that

New York, April 19. Government
officials here faced a unique problem
today resulting from the demand of
the German embassy In Washington
for the release of Wolfe von Igel and
the return of documents seized in his
office when he was arrested yester
day on an indictment charging him
with complicity in a plot to destroy
the Welland canal in Canada. Von
Igel formerly was secretary to cap
tain Franz von Papen, the recalled
military attache of the German em
bassy. Tho case seems to hinge upon the
question whether the offense charged
against von Igel was committed be
fore he was employed by tho German
oinhassy. It Is charged that the Wel

department show that it received no

Paris, April 19, 5:15 p. m. Paris
received with great enthusiasm news
of the fall of Trebizond. Tho event
was looked for, but It was not thought
the Russians would be able to capture
the city so qulokly. The political as
well as tho military consequences are
expected to bo most important, par
ticularly in view of the fact that Tur
key has lost one of the most valuable
parts of Asia Minor at a time when,
according to reports ronchlng Paris,
Germany is weakening her forces In
the Balkans to carry on attacks on
the western front.
French military writers state that
the plan of campaign of Grand Duke
Nicholas, tho Russian commander,
was a daring one, which at first wasj
looked upon as foolhardy, but now is
fully Justified. The grand duke de
cided to advance boldly to the attack
on this front where maneuvers of
warfare were possible and while tho
other fronts wero still held in dead
lock. Excluding the operations on tho Per
sian front. Grand Duke Nicholas, In
this campaign against an experienced
and stubborn foe, has to his credit the
storming of ten cities in less than -two
