lere's Complete Text of
President Wilson's Address
On Submarine Situation
Following is the complete text of
the president's address:
Gentlemen of the Conre.:
"A situation has arisen in the for
eign relations of the country of
which it is my plain duty to inform
you very rankly.
"It will be recalled that in Feb
ruary. F.U5, the imperial German
government announced its intention
to treat the waters surrounding Great
Fritain and Ireland as embraced
within the sit of war and to de
stroy all merchant ships owned by
its enemies that might be found
within any part of that portion of
the high seas, and that it warned all
vessels, of neutral as wtll as of bel
ligerent ownership, to keep out of
the waters it had thus prescribed, or
else enter them at their peril.
V. S. Government Protests.
The government of the United
States earnestly protested. It took
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without the practical
certainty of gross and palpable vio
lation of the law of nations, particu
larly if submarine craft were to he
employed as its instruments, inas
much as the rules prescribed by that
law, rules founded upon principles
of hurnanitv and established for the
protection of the lives of non-combatants
at sea could not in the na
ture of the case be observed by such
vessels. It based its protest on the
ground that persons of neutral na
tionality and vessels of neutral own
ership would be exposed to extreme
and intolerable risks and that no
right to close any part of the high
seas against their use or to expo
them to such risks could lawfully be
asserted by any' belligerent govern
ment. The law of nations !n these
matters, upon which the government
of the United States based its pro
teat is not of recent origin or found
ed upon merely arbitrary principles
set up by convention. It Is based,
on the contrary, upon manifest and
imperative principles of humanity
and has long been established with
the approval and by the express as
sent of all civilized nations.
rrexvods With Policy.
"Notwithstanding the earnest pro
test of our government, the imperial
German government at once pro
ceeded to carry out. the policy it has
announced. It expressed the hope
that the dangers involve!, at any
rate the dangers to neutral vessels,
would be reduced to a minimum by
the instructions which It had issued
to its submarine commanders, and
assured the government of the
United States that it would take
over; possible precaution both to
respect ti e rights of neutrals and to
safeguard the lives of non-combatants.
"What lifts actually happened in
the year which has since elapsed has
shown that those hopes were not
Justified, those assurances insuscep
tible of being fulfilled. In pursuance
of the policy of submarine warfare
against the commerce of its adver
saries, thus announced and entered
upon by the imperial German gov
ernment in despite of the solemn
protest of this government, the
commanders of German undersea
pssels have attacked merchant ships
with greater and greater activity, not
only upon the high seas surrounding
Great Fritain and Ireland, but wher
ever they could encounter them, in
a way that has grow n more ami more
ruthless, more and more indiscrim
inate as the months have gone by.
bss and l's-s observant of restraints
of any kind: and have delivered their
attacks without compunction against
vessels of every nationality and
bound upon every sort of errand.
Neutral Vo'cU Attacked.
Vessels of r.eutral ownership, even
vessels of neutral ownership bound
from neutral port to neutral port,
have been destroyed aloni? with ves
sels of bellUerent ownership in con
stantly increasing numbers. Some
times the merchantman attacked
lias been warned and summoned to
surrender before be'.nc: tired on or
torpedoed; sm tjmes passengers or
crews have be-"n vouchsafed the poor
security of being allowed to taV- to
the ship's boats before she was sent
to the bottom. Fut again and again,
no warning has been given, no es
cape even to the ship's boats allow
ed to thoso on board.
What this government foresaw or
must happen has happ'-ned. Trag
ely has followed tragedy on the seas
in such fashion, with such attend
ant circumstances, as t make it
gr-sly evident that warfar of such
a sort, if warfare it be. cannot h
carried n without the most ralpaMe
violation of the dictate alike of
rizht and humanity. WtVttVrr the
disposition and intention of the im
perial German covernm'nt. his
manifestly proved impossible for it
to keep such methods of attack upon
the commerce of its enenile-a within
bound set by either th" reaon or
the heart f mankind.
"In February of the present jer
the Imperial German government in
formed this gov crnt.ieflt and the
other neutral governments of the
world that it had reason to believe
that the government of Great Fritain
had armed all merchant vessels ;
Fritish ownership and had given
them secret orders to attack any
submarine of the enemy they might
encounter upon the seas, and that
the imperial German government
felt Justified in the circumstances in
treating all armed merchantmen of
belligerent ownership as auxiliary
vessels of war, which it would have
the right to destroy without warn
ing. The taw of nations has long
recognized the ri.uht of merchantmen
to carry arms for protection and
to use them to repel attack, though
to use them, in such circumstances,
nt their own risk; hut the imperial
German government claimed the
right to set these understandings
aside in circumstances which it
deemed extraordinary.
Even the terms in which it an
nounced its purpose thus still fur
ther to relax the restraints it had
previously professed its willingness
and desires to put upon the opera
tions of its submarines carried the
plain implication that at least ves
sels which were not armed would
still be exempt from destruction
without warning and that personal
safety would be accorded their pas
sen s,'ers and crews; but even that
limitation, If it was ever practicable
to observe it, has in fact constituted
no check at all upon the destruction
of ships of every sort.
Disix'iianl Assurances.
"Again and again the imperial
German government has given this
government its solemn assurances
that at least passenger ships would
not be thus dealt with, and yet it has
again and a:ain permitted its un
dersea commanders to disregard
those assurances with entire impu
nity. Great liners like the I,usltanla
and the Arabic and mere ferry boats
like the Sussex have been attacked
without a moment's warning, some
times before they had even become
aware that they were in the pres
ence of an armed vessel of the
enemy, ami the lives of non-combatants,
passengers and crew, have
been sacrificed wholesale. In a man
ner which the government of the
United States cannot but regard as
wanton and without the- slightest
color of justification. Vo limit of
any kind has in fact been set to the
indiscriminate pursuit and destruc
tion of merchantmen of all kinds
and nationalities within the waters,
constantly extending In area, where
these operations have been carried
on. and the roll of Americans who
have lost their lives on ships thus
attacked and destroyed, has grown
month by month until the ominous
toll has mounted into the hundreds.
Sussex Cas Shocking.
"One of the latent and most
shocking instances of this method of
warfare was that of the destruction
of the French cross-channel steamer
Sussex.
It must stand fourth, tj the sink
ing of the steamer Lusitania did. as
so singularly tragical ami unjustifi
able as to constitute a truly terrible
example of the inhumanity of sub
marine warfare as the commanders
of German vessels have for th past
1- months been conducting it. If
this instance stood alone, some ex
planation, some disavowal by the
Germ.au government, some evidence
of criminal mistake or wilful lis
ohedienee on the part of the com
mander of th- vessel that fired th
torpedo mi;ht be sought or enter
tained, but unhappily it does not
stand alone. Kecent events make the
nclusion inevitable that it is only
one instance, i v en though it be one
of the most extreme and distressing
instances, of the spirit and method
of warfare which the imperial Ger
man government has mistakenly
adopted, and which from the first
exposed that government to the re
proach of thrusting all neutral r,ghts
i tide in pursuit of its immediate ob
ject?. 1'. S. Has IUxni Patient.
"Th government if the Unifi
States has been very patient. At
every state of this distressing e.-
erience of tragedy after tragedy In
which its own citizens were in
volved it had sought to be restrained
from any extreme course (,f action
or of protest by a thoughtful consid
eration of the extraordinary cirrum
stances of this unpre e dentd war,
and actuated in all it said or lid by
the sentiments of jnu:ne friendship
which the people of the United
States have alvvavs er.fr ta ir.ed and
continue to entertain toward the
German nation. It has. of cc, rs.

and assurances of thr imperial Ger

Summary of Submarine Activities
Leading to Present Crisis
On Feb. 4, 1915, the German gov
ernment issued a proclamation de
claring the waters around the Brit
ish isles a war zone and giving notice
that, alter Feb. IS, all merchant
ships owned by the enemy powers
would be sunk.
On Feb. 19 the Fnited States sent
a note of protest against Germany's
submarine warfare on the ground
that Americans traveling on Fritish
and French ships would be imperil
ed. On May 7, the liner Fusitania was
sunk with the loss of about I.JO'
lives, more than 10 of the victims
being Americans. Six days later the
United States sent a note to Ger
many protesting.
Then began an exchange of notes
between the United states and Ger
many with United States maintain
ing that the German government
would be, held to strict accounta
bility. The German government on May
28 set up the contention that tne
Fusitanii was armed and wa.s car
rying munitions (contraband f
war.)
On June 10 the United States de
nied thi;t the husitana wa armed
and insisting that Germany make
proper icpa ration and promise not
to sink any more ships without
v. arnin.
