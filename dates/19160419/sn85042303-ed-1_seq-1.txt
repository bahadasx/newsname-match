INSPECTING TWINE FACTORIES.
Members of Board of Public Affairs
Planning to Install Plant.
Oklahoma City, April IS. S. L.
Morley and J. M. Aydelotte of the
state board of public affairs have
gone to inspect the twine factories ,
at the state prisons of Kansas and
Minnesota. They are preparing to
install the twine factory that has
been authorized by the legislature
for the state prison of Oklahoma and
seek to profit by the experience of
the other states in this respect.
The twine factory at McAlester
will be Installed in the new factory
building that is being completed on
the prison grounds. The use of this
building will accomplish a saving for
the state out of the appropriation
made for the factory permitting more
money to be used for the machinery
and material than would have been
the case if the building had been
erected from the same tuna.
It is the plan of the board of af-
alrs to have the twine plant In op
eration by the end of the coming
summer, if possible so that a supply
of twine may be ready for the 1917
harvest in this state, provided there
be no unnecessary delays and a
supply of raw material shall be avail
able. The prison twine factory is the
most extensive state prison Industry
so far undertaken except the prison
farms.

the cutting off of this source of supply
has left Russian church candle fac
tories with a shortage of 7.222,561
pounds for the coming year.

ORDERS FROM WASHING-
'RE ACTION OF PUNITIVE EX-
'I Until Future Course of
OF PRAYER
ARE OUTLINED
DR. M. B. WILLIAMS TELLS OF
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SIMPLE
ELEMENTS OF FAITH, SINCER
ITY AND SELF-IMMOLATION.
For the purpose of creating a spirit
of interest in the big revival meeting
being conducted In the tabernacle at
the corner of Broadway and C, north
west, twenty-three cottage prayer
meetings were conducted in different
sections of the city this morning at
10 o'clock. At three o'clock this af
ternoon Dr. Williams delivered one
of his interesting bible talks at the
tabernacle. He will continue these
talks at the same hour tomorrow and
Friday. Cottage prayer meetings will
be held again tomorrow morning.
Notice of the place and leader of
each meeting will be given in The
Ardmoreite.
The work of the chorus was excep
tionally good last night. Prof. Bray
nnd wife are endearing themselves to
the entire city by reason of their
ability and thorough consecration to
their work. Mrs. liray led the union
prayer meeting at the tabernacle yes
terday and in a sweet spirited man
ner gave valuable bints to the lead
ers on the manner of conducting cot
tage prayer meetings. Her religious
enthusiasm proved contagious, and
today has spread over the entire city.
Dr. Williams was in a spiritual
mood last evening when he faced an
audience that almost filled the big
tabernacle. "The Birth of a Nation"
and the tent show within a block of
the tabernacle did not affect the meet
ing, so far as one could tell, only a
few of the accustomed faces being
missing. Dr. Williams believes that
there is but one way to create a re
ligious upheaval in the city of Ard
more, and that prayer is the means.
Reing so forcibly impressed with
that idea, he delivered another ser
mon on the subject of "Prayer" and
his remarks were pointed, kind, form
ed from sound judgment, but very
frank. He is doing everything he
can to bring a revival to Ardmore
that comes from God, rather than
from man's excitement. The burden
of his heart i to actually revive the
churches of the city and add hun
dreds to the fold.
The evangelist used Mark 11:24
v,tj tort last evening. He stated
that many people get a wrong Idea
from this text that might be product
ive of great harm. "Every Infidel has
some reason which he assigns for
his infidelity," said Dr. William 3,
"and many of them assign the fart
that their prayers are unanswered in
the face of the promise contained in
the text.
Dr. Williams insisted that it is
absolutely useless to pray, unless we
believe the things we pray for. "Af
ter all other conditions of prayer
have been complied with they should
be bound together by the disposition.
'Thy will be done.' Jesus prayed that
prayer Himself and It is necessary
that we pray that way. However.
God teaches the lesson of submlss
Iveness some time by answering our
ESSENTIALS

Agreement Almost Necessary.
London, April 19. Premier AsquiUi

the government.
AS SOON AS FAIR GROUNDS ARE
PREPARED A THREE DAYS' PRO
GRAM WILL BE ARRANGED
PROBABLY ABOUT JULY 4.
As soon as the grand stand is erect
ed, and the track at the fair grounds
nut in first class condition, It is
planned by the chamber of commerce,
t he business men's association and the
automobile association to have a three
days' race meet here.
This, according to present plans will
be some time about the first of July,
probably beginning the fourth, and
should be as great an attraction to out
side dealers as the recent style show
was. The fair association are still nego
tiating for the grand stand at Lorena
Park, and as soon as possible it will
be transferred to the fair grounds, if
the association succeed in purchasing
it. Otherwise a new stand will be
erected. The association desires this
stand because it is one of the most
commodious in the. state and would
be ideal for the gair grounds..
President Mulkey of the local auto
mobile dealers association will confer
with the secretary of the chamber of
commerce, the business men's associa
tion and the secretary of the fair asso
ciation and some definite plans may be
looked for in the near future relative
to races.

Washington, D. C, April ly.
President Wilson sent his
nolo to Germany today warn
ing that nation that unless the
attacks upon merchantmen car
rying Americans, in violation of
international law are stopped,
diplomatic relations will be sev
ered. The president revealed
(his to Senators Stone and
Lodge and Representatives
Flood and Cooper, the ranking
democratic and republican
members of the congressional
foreign affairs committee at an
early White House conference
today.
The president explained that
the note was practically an ul-
lacis, proving uermany s as-
surances to the United States
had been violated, that the sub
marine campaign despite the
protests of the United States is
being conducted with renewed
vigor in contravention of all
l - c j: i i !i
I nations aim nunianiiy,
and that he means to sever re
lations, depends upon Ger-
many's conduct.
Representatives of the allies'
countries filled the diplomatic
galleries, as the president be
gan his review of the German
campaign. There was no de
monstration to punctuate his re
cital of the sacrifice of Ameri
can lives and no sound above
the president's voice as the
president spoke the word "Lu
sitania." Every head was bowed forward as
the president indicated that he was
approaching the keynote of his mes
sage the announcement of the
course he 'will pursue. His declara
tion that Germany ha3 made It plain
that she Intends to continue the In
discriminate warfare In defiance of
international law and the protests of
the L'nited States was followed by
the statement that this determination,
had left but one course open to the
l'nited States.
When he pronounced the" words of
the ultimatum, declaring that unless
Germany should Immediately declare
and effect an abandonment of the In
discriminate submarine warfare, this
government would have no choice but
to sever diplomatic relations, there
was still no demonstration,-only a
tense silence and reflection of the
gravity of his words.
When he concluded with the ex
pression of hope that Germany would
so act as to avert a regrettable break
with America, the assemblage broke
Into cheers. It was 1:14 o'clock
when the president concluded. He
had spoken Just fifteen minutes. The
applause started from the democratic
side and the republican members
