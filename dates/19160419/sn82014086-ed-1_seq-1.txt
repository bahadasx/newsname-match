Bad Weather Has Impeded Activity of Troops Around
Verdun.
Pressing their attack vigorously by
land and sea, the Russians have cap
tured Turkey's most important port on
ihe Black sea Trebizond. That the
joint attack by the land and naval
forces was sharp, quick and decisive
is Indicated by the fact that a Russian
official communication had just an
nounced that the Russian land forces
were at the village of Drona, seven
miles east of Trebizond. when a new
announcement of the fall of the town
was made.
The port and outlying defenses had
been strongly fortified since the fall
of Erzerum and the Turkish garri
son was estimated at three full divi
sions. The Russians are also continuing
their drive against the Turks in the
region of Baiburt to the southeast, the

This is part of the plan for the isola

weather has impeded the activity of
the troops around Verdun, in all the
sectors of which there have been only
intermittent bombardments. The only

The Italians on the western top of

Hastings-on-Hudson, N. T April 18.
The plant of the National Conduit

ficials that the plant would remain
closed indefinitely or until the strikers
agreed to accept a compromise offer.
The demands or the strikers include
a fifty-hour week instead ot one or
fifty-four hours and a wage increase
of five cents an hour. The company
declined to shorten the day but an
nounced its willingness to pay two and
one-fourth cents more an hours. This
offer the strikers refused.

With Germany is Said to be Imminent.
The Most Important Position on the
Anatolian Coast.
Petrograd, via London, April IS,
10.55 ip. m. The fall of Trebizond to
the Russian arms is conhrmed in an
official communication issued late to
day.
The statement says:
"Trebizond has been taken. The
united enereetic effort of our Cauca
sian army and Black Sea fleet have
been crowned by tne conquest ui ims
fortified town, the most important po
sition on the Anatolian coast.
"Our valiant troops after the san
guinary battle of the fourteenth on
the Kara Dere river. pressed the
Turks without respite and surmount
ed incredible obstacles, everywhere
breaking the fierce resistance of th
enemy. The well-combined action of
the fleet permitted the execution of
most 'hazardous landing operations
and lent the support of its artillery to
the troops operating in the coastal
region.
"Credit for this fresh victory also is
partly due to the assistance given the
Caucasian army by the troops oper
ating in other directions in Asia .Mi
nor. By their desperate fighting and
heroic exploits they did everything in
their power to facilitate the task of
the detachments on the coast."
Trebizond is a city of Asia Minor
on the Black Sea, 575 miles east of
Constantinople and 100 miles north of
Erzerum, the town stormed by the
Russians on February 16. Trebizond
has a population of about 40,000, in
cluding some 18,000 Christians.
The importance of the Black sea
port was due to its command of the
point where the chief trade route from
Persia and central Asia descends to
the sea. It is separated from the rest
of Asia Minor by a barrier of rugged
mountains, 7,000 to 8,000 feet high
which the Russian armies had to traverse.
Aided bv the Russian fleet the in
vaders pushed past the last series of
natural obstacles along the coast
when on Sunday, they occupied a
strongly fortified Turkish position on
the left bank of the Kara Dere. 12
miles outside the fortress.
Since the fall of Erzerum and the
capture three weeks later m T?itlis,
the Turks are said to have increased
the Trebizond garrison until it con
tained three complete divisions, or
about 54,000 men and to have .done
everything possible to strengthen the
Black sea port.

3ERLIN PAPERS PREPARING
FOR AMERICAN NOTE.
Tone Seems to Be "Let President Wil
son Do His Worst."
Berlin, via London, April 19, 3.4o a.
m. The newspapers have begun pre
paring the public for the early recep
tion of the American note by comment
ing on Washington despatches an
nouncing the comppletion of the docu
ment. Various rumors are discussed and
surmises risked regarding the charac
ter of the note, but nobody knows
anything definite concerning it. Nev
ertheless, the situation causes apre
hension. Disappointment is expressed that
Foreign Minister Von Jagow's answers
to the American inquiries have had so
little effect in satisfying Washington.
Some of the newspapers note what
they term President Wilson's apparent
anxiety to withdraw from the Mexican
undertaking and interpret it as a bad
omen for the future relations between
the United States and Germany.
The conservative organs, while evi
dently not wanting a breach, appear
to be resigned, their tone summed up
feeing "Let President Wilson do his
worst."
Tho Frankfurter Zeitung, which is
eager to see the matter amicably set
tled, says:
"II President Wilson wants a breach.
no answer which Germany can give
under the existing circumstances can
satisfy him. If he seriously wants
peace, he must choose the ways and
means for bringing the imperative de
mands of Germany's submarine war
fare into harmony with the justifiable
Interests of neutral countries."

of the Tages Zeitung, today prints an

Three Men Said to Be Germans With

Savannah, Ga, April 18. Three men,
said to be Germans, but whose names
were not given out by officials, were
arrested today at Hardeeville, S. C, at
the request of Lieut. A. P. Cronkhite,
U. S. Engineer corps, who suspected
them of espionage. A search of the
prisoners, It was said, revealed that
they were in possession of maps giv
Ins minute details of fortifications and
roads along t&ils section of the coast
and carried an elaborate photographic
outfit.
A charge of vagrancy on which the
men were taken into custody was
changed to a charge of being "suspi
cions characters" when each of the
thlree produced $5,000 to disprove the
vgrant aaarge.
Washington, April 18.An armistice
has been declared between Chinese
rebels nad President Yuan Shai-Kai,
ana peace negotiations are in progress,
the state department has been officially
informed. Prominent leaders of both
factions are endeavoring to reunite the
provinces.
The American minister at Peking
advised the department that President
Yuan's agent in peace negotiations is
his former vice president, who resigned
when Yuan proposed a monarchy with
himself as emperor. His former war
minister also has agreed to aid in peace
parleys.
The Chinese legation also received
despatches of the same nature. The
understanding is that one of the pro
visions of the armistice stipulates that
Yuan Shai-Kai shall remain at the
head of the government, and that the
condition was made by some of the
rebel chiefs themselves.

DEATHS FROM BRADFORD
WRECK REMAIN AT FIVE
London, April 18, 10.85 p. m. That a
grave cabinet crisis exiss is undenia-
Dle. but according to an authoritative
statement tonight no resignations,
either ministerial of military, have yet
been tendered, and it will probably bo
several days before the crisis is ended.
The Marquis of Crewe, lord president
of the council, in his statement to the
house of lords today,, which was the
first official admission of the gravity
and complexity of the problems divid
ing the ministers, intimated the possl-
uiuiy mat i-remier Asquua mignt not
be prepared even on Thursday to
make his promised statement, in Which
case the house would sit the following
aionuay.
Universal Military Service.
Both sides in this momentous con
flict are marshaling all their available
forces for the parliamentary struggle
over Sir Edward Carson's motion for
universal military service. Strong
whips are out and all the members of
he house of commons serving at the
front have been granted leave to re
main in London until a division is
taken.
Political gossip tonight centers
mainly around Minister of Munitions
uavid Lloyd George and Winston
pencer Churchill and the nonssibilltv
of Air. Lloyd George succeeding Mr.
csquitn as nead of the government.
Attack on Ministry Powerful.
While the conscrintionlst attacK on
the ministry is undoubtedly powerful
and threatening, there are also atrone
lorces making lor the retention of the
present coalition ministry first. Mr.
Asquith's known skill in surmounting
political difficulties and holding his
team together, and. second, the prob
lem of finding an alternative govern
ment to the present coalition and the
repugnance felt in large sections of
tne country to a change in the gov
ernment at a critical stage of the
nations fate.
Lloyd-George May Succeed Asquith,
In the event of the dlsannearance of
Mr. Asquith as a result of his refusal
to remain a member of a government
resorting to universal service, Mr.
lioya-oeorge is regarded In many
quarters as his natural successor. But
against this solution is the fact that
a very strong section of the unionist
party is entirely opposed to Mr. Lloyd -
vieorge, as it is to Mr. Asqunn. More
over, it is known that Andrew Bonar
Law, who is a conscrintionlst in Drin
ciple and was leader of the unionist
party prior to entering the coalition
government, and whose reputation as a
parliamentarian has grown enormous
ly since the war. making him a nossi
ble successor to Mr. Asquith, attaches
tne utmost importance in the national
interest to tho maintenance of the
present coalition ministry in power.

It was thought probable, though no
official would talk about this phase of
the question, that the German situa
tion, would have some bearing on the
Impending decision. If a break In
diplomatic relations with Germany Is
foreseen by the administration, it Is
very certain that the troops will be

purpose of the exwdi?ion. protection
of the border. Is regarded as accom

cussed, however.
