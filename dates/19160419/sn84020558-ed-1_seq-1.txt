Submarine Crisis Coming
Today When Wilson Lays
THE TEST
President's Determination
to Lay Submarine Issue
Squarely Before Congress
Recalls Some of His Re
cent Public Utterances
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April IS. Presi
dent Wilson's determination to lay
the submarine issue before congress
tomorrow recalls some of his recent
public utterances on his conception
of America's duty to humanity. They
were made while the president was
preparing his final word on the sub
marine crisis, and although his words
were not directly connected with any
particular phase of foreign affairs,
they are regarded as highly signifi
cant now.
"Are you ready for the test?" the
president asked his hearers last
Thursday night at a Jefferson Day
celebration. "God forbid that we
should become directly or indirectly
embroiled in quarrels not of our own
choosing, and that does not affect
v. I at we feel responsible to defend,
but If we should ever be drawn are
you leady to go in only where the
ir.ttrests of America are coincident
with the interest of mankind and to
draw out the moment the interest
ccnteis in America and is narrowed
from the wide circle of humanity?"
"Are you ready for the test? Have
you the courage to go in? Have you
the courage to come out according
as the balances disturbed are re
adjusted J'or the interests of hu
manity?" Yes'crday, before the Daughters of
tlvs American Revolution the presi
dent declared:
"America will have forgotten lier
traditions whenever upon any oc
casion, she fights merely for herself
under Biich circumstances as will
show that she has forgotten to fight
Jor all mankind. And the only excuse
that America can ever have for the
assertion i,f l.cr physical force is
that she asset ts It in behalf, of the
interest of humanity."
The president made the latter re
marks at a meeting to which he
went directly from work, upon
statement to congress tomorrow.

WILMINGTON, Del., April 18. Ernest Schiller, alias Clarence R.
Hudson, who forcibly took possession of the British Steamer Matoppo,
off Sandy Hook, on March 29, terrorized the crew and compelled the cap
tain to change the ship's course, was sentenced to life imprisonment in
the U. S. District court here late today. He will be taken to the fed
eral prison at Atlanta, in a few days.
Schiller this morning pleaded guilty to the charge of piracy in a state
ment he denied that his motive was robbery. He declared that he had
seized the Matoppo, believing the vessel carried munitions of war for

Matter Before Congress
In Hall of House at One 0 'Clock This Afternoon Presi

United States to Germany In Grave Situation Which
Has Kept Two Nations on Brink of War for Nearly
Year An Ultimatum to Germany and Even Sever

Eventualities.
(Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 18. President Wilson will lay
the submarine crisis before congress tomorrow. In the
hall of the house of representatives, at one o clock m the
afternoon, with congress seated before him, in joint ses
sion, the president will speak the last words of the United
States to Germany, in the grave situation which has kept
the two nations on the brink of a break for nearly a year.
Developments yet undisclosed, and of the most solemn
importance are expected to follow quickly.
An ultimatum to Germany
diplomatic relations are two most likely eventualities.
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning the president will
receive, at the White House,
of the congress (committees dealing with foreign atlairs,
and Senator Lodge and Representative Cooper, the rank
ing republican members.
The often repeated statement from the White House
and bv administration officials that before breaking off
diplomatic relations with Germany, the president would
fully advise the heads of the foreign affairs committee
was recalled tonight in connection with the announcement
of the meeting and it was everywhere regarded as the
forerunner of utmost gravity.
Tonight all official Washington, fearing the worst
and hoping for the best' is practically in ignorance, of the
details of the president's plans.
Soon after noon today, and just after
the cabinet had departed, the president
summoned Secretary Tumulty. He in
structed him to go to the capitol at
4:30 o'clock and not before and ar
range for a joint session of house and
senate, at 1 o'clock tomorrow after
noon. The president did not state his
purpose to his secretary and instructed
him specifically to inform the leaders
he had no knowledge of the president's
design, further than that important
affairs were to be communicated to
congress.
Promptly at the hour named, his
secretary' went to the president's room
in the capitol, and sent for Chairman
Stone and majority leader Kern.

WASHINGTON, April 18 The
German embassy today demanded of
the state department the immediate

tions said tonight the matter had not
been brought to his attention. It was
understood that the state depart
ment's request would be acted upon
tomorrow.
Prince von Halzfeldt, counselor of
the embassy, who made the represen
tations demanded that the papers and
documents be sealed and restored
without being photographed or
copied.
The action was based upon ground
that the office in which the seizures
occurred In reality is a branch of
the embassy. -
It was said at the embassy that the
contents of the papers were un
known here and that the demand
for their restoration was made after
von Igel had communicated over, the
lone distance telephone from New
York.
State department records show that
formal notification of the appoint
ment of von Igel was received during
last September, after von Papen had
been declared persona non grata. Von
Igel had been In the office of von

that.

DIFFERENCES UP
TO CONFERENCES
On Eve of Joint Session to
Hear Message, on Grave
International Issues, Sen
ate Hastens Completion
of Measure
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 18. An
army reorganization bill that would
produce regular army and reserve
military forces in the United
States aggregating a million men,
was passed by the senate tonight
without a record vote. It is a sub
stitute for the Hay bill, passed by
the house, and the differences will
be worked out in conference.
On the eve of a joint session of
the houses of congress to hear a
message from the president on
grave international issues, the
senate hastened completion of the
bill amid scenes of excitement, re
peatedly rejecting all amendments
tending to reduce the proposed
strengthening of the army.
With the closing hours of debate,
the senate made provision for a
regular standing army with a
peace strength of 250.000 men, as
compared with 140.000 in the Hay
bill, which passed the house, re
tained after a hard fight, the plan
for a federal volunteer army re
serve force calculated to aggregate
261,000 men and federalize the na
tional guard forces of the states
to an estimaed strength of 280,000
men.
In addition to this combined
regular and reserve force of 790,
000 men, an amendment was made
to create a school and college
youths' reserve corps in time of
war or threatened war which
would recruit a force of trained
your.g men, schooled by officers of
the regular army, the estimated
strength of which is anywhere
from 200,000 to 400,000.
Peace Army of Million
"We ere creating here tonight a
peace army of a million men," de
clared Senator Myers, in supporting an
.amendment of Senator Reed, to make
the regular army 200.000. The senate
had agreed previously by a vote of 43
to 37 to an amendment by Senator
Erandegec incerasing it from the pro
posed strength of 180,000 to 250,000.
The Reed reduction proposalwa3 re
jected 42 to 31, after a brief speech by
Senator Williams, in which he referred
to the solemnity of the occasion which
would confront congress tomorrtfw.
"Are or are we not threatened
with war?' a:kcd Senator Williams.
"Are we or are we not threatened with
war from Mexico? Are we or are we
not threatened with war over the sub
marine controversy? Have we not
been called to assemble in joint session
tomorrow, the solemn purpose of which
we do not ourselves definitely under
stand?" "Ii the army cannot exceed a cer
tain number except in a state of
threatened war, we are now in a state
of threatened war if the president
thinks so. For myself I think we are
I retty seriously threatened with inter
national difficulties, both from the east
and the south."
Th apparently grave developments
of the few hours preceding the passage
of the bill also probably served to save
the volunteer army provision. Cham
pions of tl'e national guard fought it
bitterly in the committee of the whole,
and it was retained by a vote of 34 to
2. Tonight Senator Lewis again
moved to strike out the section. It was
saved this time by a vote of 40 to 37.

based on official messages from mil

The Villa bandits are being scat
tered into small bunches, he said
none containing more than 20 to 30
men at the most. These are being
systematically hunted down, accord
ing to his advices.
It is the plan of the Chihuahua au-
thorities to place these men in gar-
rison in the various cities of the
state, having a large cavalry detach-
ment at each post, as soon as the
American troops withdraw. When-

"I know bevond any question of doubt
that Villa was wounded at Guerrero. I
have received my account of the affair
from a man in whom I have the fullest
confidence. He tells me that Villa was
shot through the right knee, the bullet
killing his horse which fell pinning the
bandit under it and injuring his left
leg. This was on March 29. After
that I received daily reports about
Villa's movement up to April 5 when he
was at Satevo. Since then I have
heard nothing about him. Knowing his
condition and the certainty of his be
ing wounded I consider it highly prob
able that he is dead as he assuredly
could not have got any proper medical
treatment."
. Additional weight was given to this
statement in view of the fact that the
man who made it is frankly in favor
of intervention and regards the death
of Villa as a blow to his hopes as it
would mean the withdrawal of the
American troops.
Significance is also seen in the at
titude of the Mexican officials here and
in Juarez who have never abated their
confidence in the truth of the report of
Villa's death. In spite of the incredu
lity of General Bell and other American
Paso, out of the question because of
Cairanza's refusal to permit it and
the reluctance of the administration
to authorize its seizure.
Additional troops are being sent to
General Pershing as much for the
protection of those already in Mexico
along the line of communication as to
strengthen the force pursuing Villa
in the region south of Satevo. Marked
hostility has been displayed along the
line of communications by Villa's men
and indications have been numerous
that not all the Carranza element,
both military and civil, were friendly.
Scouts are continuing their work of
locating Carranza troops in that vi
cinity. Little actual work In the chase of
Villa has been done since the Amer-
ienn troops were forced into a fight

of General Pershing have occupied
points from where concentration can
be made rapidly and General Persh

quarters at Namiquipa, some distance
north of Satevo.

men returning to the border today
brought reports of quiet prevailing
along the American line of communica

eventful, they said, and rumors of
trouble which have been current in

the line. '
Much interest was aroused here by

Next Move of Expedition
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 18. The ad
ministration is waiting on further
reports from American officers in.
Mexico before deciding whether the
expedition seeking Villa shall be
withdrawn or reinforced for further
operations.
Indications at the war department
bore out press reports from the front,
that the pursuit of Villa was tem
porarily at a standstill.
President Wilson and his cabinet
discussed the Mexican situation brief
ly today in the light of a review of
its military aspects, submitted by
General Funston. It was announced
later that the situation was un-
changed and the administration's
policy unaltered. One member of the
cabinet admitted, however, that no
final decision had been reached as to
the withdrawal of the troops.
Officials would reveal no word of
the report submitted by General Fun
ston. It was apparent, however, that
it outlined a situation which required
action in Washington. The line of
communication with General Persh
ng's forces already is drawn too thin.
and there is no disposition here to
contradict border advices that more
troops must be sent if the chase is to
be pressed further.
It was thought probable, though no
official would talk about this phase
of the question, that the German sit
uation would have some bearing upon
the impending decision. If a break
in diplomatic relation with Germany
is foreseen by the administration, it
Is virtually certain that the troops
will be recalled from Mexico immedi
ately. They would be needed at home
as military prudence would require
that steps be taken to prepare for
eventualities in Europe.
Some officials expressed the belief
that the United States must wait and
see what happened beyond the border,
before it could determine whether to
increase the American forces or with
draw at once. The report of Villa's
death has not been cleared as yet.
Doubt as to its truth is steadily in
creasing, and dispatches from Consul
Letcher at Chihuahua City, received
today, characterized the report as a
mere rumor, without any foundation
that he could ascertain.
The Washington government, as
nearly as the attitude of the cabinet
can be learned, Is in no mood to force
matters in Mexico. Already the main
purpose of the expedition, protection
of the border, is regarded as ac
complished. In some quarters It was suggested
that nn agreement for withdrawal
might be reached with General Car
ranza on the basis that if Villa or his
hand reached within some specified
distance of the border, despite the ef
forts of Carranza troops to check
them, United States troops could
again cross the border. There was
nothing to indicate that this plan had
actually been worked out.
In moving new forces to the border
or possibly beyond, as reported to
night in San Antonio dispatches.
