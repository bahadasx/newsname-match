Crowd of 8 3 Men Applauds Address
at Board of Trade Banquet
OTHER GOOD SPEAKERS PRESENT
State Secretary J. P. Taylor Augments
Mr. Wilson at Enthusiastic An
nual Meeting Last Evening.
The annual Hoard of Trade
meeting and banquet was held
in the Putnam house dining room
last evening. Not one of the
88 men present went to sleep
while either meal or speaking was in
progress. In fact, Bennington for sev
eral seasons has not seen the like of
last evening's gathering either In
demonstration of the get together
spirit or menu of speaking which was
presented.
Hon. Lucius E. Wilson, the man who
is putting over the big Eastern States
Industrial Exhibit in Springfield, and
who is founder and head of the Ameri
can City Bureau, was the principal
orator of the evening and James 1'.
Taylor, secretary of the Greater Ver
mont association also made a splendid
address.
President William II. Nichols in a
prosperous vest of snowy white and
a smile of Bennington prosperity
which he is ever unable to conceal,
acted as toastmaster. After a sub
stantial meal of six courses, the prin
cipal ingredient of which was turkey,
the business scheduled to come before
the Board for transaction, was begun.
" Chairman Harry B. North of the
New Enterprises committee was first
to present his report, reviewing the
activities of his department and pre
eenting a brief analysis of the local
situation.
A. J. Holden, head of the finance
committee presented a brief report of
the work of his committee which was
necessarily curtailed owing to the iiit
ability of the industrial committee to
get the class or industries tins year
which would be a benefit to the com
munity. F. E. Howe spoke for the publicity
committee and urged the establish
ment of the proposed auto bus line be
tween Bennington and Dorset and
George M. Hawks spoke on the real
estate situation as applicable to loca
tion of future Industrial plants.
Collins M. Graves, as head of the
hotel, and summer resort committee,
which has for its purpose the ultimate
promotion of a new and large hotel
for the village, told of his experiences
in interviewing prospective hotel man
agers. Mr. Graves stated that he was
in communication with n man who
would come to Bennington and float a
new hostelry enterprise here on com
pletion of the war, on the proviso that
for every dollar he Invested, Benning
ton raise a similar sum. He stated
that the cost of such an undertaking
would involve at least $100,000. This
hotel man stated that Bennington vil
lage was the location for such an en
terprise, instead of Old Bennington
and that the value of such a business
would be enhanced by the location
here of the new Putnam Memorial hos
pital. It is the experience of hotel
men that a hostelry located In a com
munity which boasts a good hospital
is a much better paying proposition
than one without.
Harrison I Norton considered the
close of Mr. Graves remarks an excel
lent opportunity to call on the chair
man for a rising vote of thanks of the
entire board, both as an organization
and as individuals, publically express
lng Bennington's gratitudo to Henry
W. Putnam, Jr., for the $90,000 recent
ly given for the completion of tho Put
nam Hospital, ine motion was car
ried and the action went on record.
Treasurer H. Harry Sharpe, next
made his report, showing the finances
of the Board in good shape at the
opening of the new fiscal year with a
balance of $245 in the treasury.
Secretary Emory S. Harris next
gave the secretary's report of the
work of the past year.
Secretary Willard W. Bartlett of the
County Improvement Association
made a terse five-minute speech on the
benefits ofVgatherlngs of the present
order and the necessity for the bust
ncRS men of a community knowing one
another better before community work
can go forward.
Ab the dinner was also the annual
business meeting, the nomination of
the board of nine directors was next in
order and it was moved that the chair
appoint a committee on nominations
which would confer and bring in
pultabln selection of men for this re
sponsible position. P. E. Howe, Har
rlson I. Norton, Dr. L. II. Ross, A
Holden and II. Harry Sharpe were ap
pointed by the chair as nominating
committee, following the consultation
of which, the following directors were
chosen by unanimous vote: William
II. NIcholR. John Nash. Dr. F. S. Pratt,
A. C. LaMarro, II. B. North. Hiram L.
Hall. Fred C. Martin, Collins M.
Graves, William II. Wills. Mr.

Nichols declined to serve for
another year, considering that hav
ing been on this board for three years
and president of the board for two
more, that someone else should be giv
more, that someone else should be
given a chance. His suggestion was

Toastmaster Nichols next called on
Secretary J. P. Taylor of the Greater
'ermont Association and Mr. Taylor
responded with his customary punch
and energy. He touched briefly on
two important points, the need of Vor-
monters to advertise Vermont and the
pretentious gathering this year at
Montpelier when tho Greater Vermont
Association will sponsor a state-wide
demonstration in celebration of the
125th anniversoary of the entrance of
Vermont into the union., His address
was a plea for Bennington to do her
share in sending a delegation to as
sist In making this affair of nation
wide interest.
It was after 10 o'clock before the
principal speaker was introduced in a
cries of appropriate paragraphs by
Mr. Nichols. It was the first time that
many Bennington business men had
ever seen .Mr. Wilson or heard him
speak, but he lived up to his appear
ance and reputation. Mr. Wilson is a
livo wire and it took only three
minutes, after he got on his feet, for
the room of men to find it out.
Mr. Wilson is a clean-cut man with
clean-cut vocabulary and he knew
his subject: The purpose of a Board
of Trade in a community the size of
Bennineton. Although he is at. pres
ent a Vennonter, yet he made no
denial of the fact that he believed in
the business spirit with which the far
west looks upon community work and
business boosting and his remarks
from first to last were a plea for the
state to work away from the hide
bound, moss-backed slough of over
conservatism which has been charac
teristic of New England for the past
generation and innoculate our public
and business lile with the confidence
in tomorrow which is one of the west's
chief factors in its remarkable growth
and business optimism.
He took up his subject in three divis
ions: The spirit of co-operating, the
spirit of giving and the spirit of ap
preciating. He stated that a com
munity does not grow merely because
of natural resources and cited in
stances of several great business cen
ters which have led in the particular
class of industries in which they ex
cel, not because they were located
near to raw materials, but because the
co-operative spirit toward some one
great end, made them what they are.
Gary, Ind., for steel, Grand Kapids for
furniture and Kansas City for farm
machinery were cited as instances.
The spirit of giving, the speaker
stated, was the second step in the busi
ness evolution and prosperity of a
community. The business of learning
to give and the buslnes cf learning to
smoke, he declared, were usually at
tended by exactly the same symptoms.
He brought out the fact that It is not
the wealthy community which gives,
but that the citizens grow wealthy
through the wine and generous habit
ot giving.
In the course of his report, chair
man II. B. North had referred to the
fact that the Board had not been In
strumental in gaining new industries
during the past year. Mr. Wilson
siezed upon this as an argument that
a board of trade, anywhere, is not
merely a factory promoting organiza
tion and if the industrial committee
had turned down propositions during
the past year, there would doubtless
be many knockers, mostly outside the
boaid, who would point to this as good
excuse for not continuing with their
support. On the other hand, the speak
er maintained that a board of trade
was chiefly an instrument for creating
community spirit, and so long as they
did this, no such chamber of commerce
is a failure, but inversely was a entire
ly fulfilling the function for which it
war organized.
The speaker also siezed upon a re
mark made by another previous speak
er that the housing problem in Ben
nington was becoming Rerious. lie
declared that a community which
could not house the workmen who la
bored in its factories, did not deserve
to have new factories. He urged
special attention to remedy this sitna
tion.
Under the head of appreciating one's
own community he brought in the ne
cessity for a steadfast belief in the hi
tin e typified by the west, ngninst a
constant looking backward to the
greatness of yesterday as exemplified
by the east. To appreciate one's com
munity it wa necessary to believe in
its future possibilities and work them
to the utmost.
Mr. Wilson spoke for an hour and
summarized a splendid address with
tho 40110-year old quotation from Solo
mon: "That people which is without
vision, is perished."
Following Mr. Wilson's address, Karl
W. Williams furnished some informa
tion regarding an automobile bus line
between Bennington and Dorset, the
formation of a company to promote
which had been suggested during the
meeting. A vote was tuken to estab
lish such n line in order to bring the
smaller towns toward the north In
touch with Bennington and swing busi
ness here which Is now going to Rut
bind on account of Inconvenient train
service. The cost of such a proposi
tion and other detail was gone into by
Mr. Williams, full account of which Is
printed elsewhere in today's paper.
QUESIIDII (IF BUS
LIKE 10 DORSET
Board of Trade Approves Establish
ment of Daiiy Auto Service
WOULD BRING TRADE INTO TOWN
Company May Be Formed to Purchase
Three Cars for Inter-Town Trans
portation in Near Future.
A bus line of automobiles, operating
between Bennington and the towns to
the north as far as Dorset, was con
sidered in the board of trade annual
meeting at the Putnam House Tues
day evening.
The idea is to maintain at least three
automobile busses which shall ply
over the line and carry passengers with
better service than is possible at pre
sent by the railroad. Incidentally it
will be the means of intercommuni
cation between the towns up the val
ley, as well as bringing trade to Ben
nington stores.
Such a line could be run seven
mouths in the year and in addition to
the service which It would render,
would also pay a satisfactory dividend.
as where such a venture has been tried
in other places covering similar terri
tory, it has been a financial success.
In his remarks at the banquet Tues
day evening, Earl W. Williams, pro
prietor of the Bennington Garage, who
has been too much trouble to compile
facts and figures regarding the finan
cial and service features of such a line.
stated that there were three proposi
tions: One to cost $4SoO, another to
cost $3200 and a third, employing Ford
machines which will cost $2001) to
t-qui,-.
The fares will average about three
cents a mile and t he busses will be
timed () that residents of up-valley
towns can get prompt service either
way. At the present time there are
towns to the north touched by trains
only tlco a day. so that a shopper
must come down early in tho morning
and remain here until late in the af
ternoon. I nder the new service it will
be possible to come down to Benning
ton and return in a few hours.
Dorset particularly would benefit by
such a route, as at present there is a
six-mile territory between the town
and railroad which must be traversed
before a train can be taken. The bus
line would run to Dorset village.
The Idea is to form a stock company
and float its securities among Benning
ton people who would be most profit
ed by such a line. A canvass will be
made by a special toiinnltte e of the
board uftrade.
An Interesting feature of the pro
gram was the unexpected pleasure the
member? had In listening to Major
Robert H. llendershot, the famous
Drummer Boy ol the Rappahannock,
who with h!s son volunteered several
vocal,' piano and drum numbers while
tho meal was In progress. Maj. llen
dershot, who is in town for the enter
tainment to be given this evening in
Libiary hall under direction of the S.
of V.. rendered several outhern darky
songs and patriotic pieces with file
nnd drum, which were loudly applaud
ed.
As a whole, the gathering was one of
the most enthusiastic the hoard has
held and far surpassed the meeting of
last year when only about half the
number were present.
RUSSIA WILL CAN MEATS
War Responsible for Development
of
tho Industry.
Russia has taken the first steps tow
urd the organization of a meat canning
industry, according to advices received
by the National Provisioned Tim first
ol' a string of factories is now in oper
ation in Astrakhan, at the mouth of
the River Olga. which has nearly one
third of European Russia as its basin,
a region largely devoted to cattle rais
ing. The plan for the development cf
the industry was the outgrowth of
military necessity and the problem of
feeding Russia's vast army.
Although the second largest of the
world's cattle raising countries, Russia
used but comparatively little canned
meat before the war for the reason
that only IS per cent, of her popula
tion lived in towns.

South Carolina "Superiority."
Geographically this Is an exceed

people are exceedingly provincial in
their Ignorance of any section except
that in which I hey live. We suppose
Vermont is called tho Green Moun

in it and its people are green, about
all in it, except Hs pines, that Is green
more than two or three months in the
year. Now that statement may ex
pose our provincial ignorance and nar
rowness. But. even at that we can
feel superior to the editor of the Ben
nington. Vt.. Banner, one of whose
editorials we republish elsewhere on
this page. If ever congress gets sense
enough to repeal that tool law which
prevents pauper newspaper men from
exchanging advei Using for interstate
transportation, we are going to ac
cept that Banner man's imitation, lie
may open our eyes, but his will be
bigger n sou) plates vhen we prove to
him that South Carolina, the fertility
of whose soil he ignorantly derides,
holds practically every worth while
record for crop yield per acre. Why
Jerry Moore, a boy, not to mention
Captain Drake, a veteran farmer,
raised more corn on one acre of South
Carolina soil than we believe they can
raise on a whole farm in Vermont
And, 'sides all that, nobody, even in
the -wildest dream, ever attempted to
locate the original site of tho Garden
of Eden as far north as Vermont. On
the other hand, there are lots of peo

that very identical spot, or at least
thoy were until Governor Mannin
came down so hard upon the blind
tigers there.
And if that Bennington man will
tome here, to this incomparable Pied

Russians. The fall ol Irebizond to
the Russian army is eontiriied in an
official communication issued late yes

the Black sea, 575 miles east of
'onstantinople and 100 mlkn north of
Krzerum, the town stormo.l by the
Russians on Februaiy 10. Trebizond
has a population of about 4().00u, in
cluding some 18,000 Christians. The
importance of the Black sea. port was

GRAPE JUICE NOT EFFECTIVE
Daniels' Cry Order Fails to

Washington. April 17. Commenting
on Admiral Flske's letter to the Secre
tary of the Navy upon the latter's wine
mess order Representative Britten of
Illlonis, a member of the House Naval
Affairs Committee, said today that the
prohibition of wine and beer at oth
ers' tables had not led to an appreci
able reduction in the number of courts
martial for drunkenness.
"The records of the Navy Depart
ment show." said Mr. Britten, '"that
during the year 1913 (prior to the Dan

during tho year 1915. following the

his testimony before the committee

MR. HOLDEN GIVES CAMP
To Be Erected for Use of the Boys of
the Y. M. C. A.
At the April meeting, the board of
directors of the Y. M. C. A. formally
accepted the offer of Arthur J. Holden
to build a tamp to be used in conjunc
tion with the building.
Mr. Holden made the proposition
some mouths ago, that If a camp would
meet a real need, he would build it.
In the meantime the matter has been
gone into exhaustively, in spite of the
first general opinions expressed by
everyliody, that it would be a good
thing. Camp leaders, the Interna
tional Committee of Y. M. C. A.'s. and
local parents have been consulted,
with a resulting unanimity of opinion
that a camp would be one of the best
features the; Association could adopt.'
The camp will be located about two
miles from the Y. M. C. A. building, on
the eastern outskirts of the ullage, off
Burgess road on property owned by
Mr. Holden. betw een Burgess road and
Furnace Grove. The camp will stand
on a rise Mich witl command a fine
view to the west. There Is a good
spring at hand, and it will be possible
to get a swim by a short hike.
The building will consist of a large
room about 20 by HO, with three bunks
in each corner, and a stone fireplace.
A kitchen w ill be constructed on the
rear. A bread piazza will cross the
front. The building will be made com
fortable in winter as well as slimmer.
Edward E. Parlln, manual training
instructor in tho schools, is working
on detailed plans, and the work will
probably be done by the boys under
bis direction. This activity of the
boys will be an end in itself.
The camp will not b regarded as a
vacation camp primarily, but as an .ob
jective point for over night hikes, spec
ial meetings, suppers, etc. It will be
a welcome rendezvous for the Boy
Scouts. It will always be under the
supervision of the employed officers of
the Association or competent leaders.
Such a camp seems a logical thing
In t his beautiful open country. In
adopting it the Association is simply
extending its theory of supplementing
the normal life of the hoys and young
men, and the normal ,boy camps.
Many boys, however, do not have ac
cess to camps, and to them especially
will it come a:? a boon.
Life itt the camp will be organized
and planned so that all will be occupi
ed in one way or another. Order,
c leanliness, system, temperance and
high purpose are not. incompatible
with the best results of or the fullest
enjoyment of camp life.
The many small parties which can
use the camp will assure to every boy
a chance to share its benefits, and the
community as a whole is thus the
benefactor cf Mr. Holden's generosity.

Washington, April 19. Unless the
German imperial government makes a
radical and immediate change in the
policy of its submarine warfare
against passenger and freight-carrying ,

In a statement In which the president
airaigned the submarine warfare of
Germany in the severest terms.
Iho president declared that he 'had
reached the decision with the keenest
regret" but went on to say that the
defence cf our rights as a nation left
us no otiier course of action.
Washington. April 19. President
Wilson will lay the submarine crisis

Developments yet undisclosed and of
the most solemn importance are ex
