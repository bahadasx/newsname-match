COLUMHUS ItAID MADE
A SUBJECT OF IXQUIIIV
Washington, April 15. The War
Department has ordered a new and
thorough Investigation as to why It
was possible for Vllllstas to raid Co
lumbus, N. M., without being detect
ed In their advance by the United
States troops stationed there.
The Investigation is being con
ducted by General Funston at Fort
Sam Houston, following a transmis
sion to him of Secretary of War Ba
ker's decision that there was appar
ently little excuse for the Vllllstas
being able to slip Into Columbus un
observed. Orders for a broad Investigation
were decided upon after a prelimi
nary Inquiry, which failed to prove
satisfactory to General Funston or
tho War Department. The first In
quiry was made shortly after the
raid, when Col. Slocum, who com
manded the seven troop3 of cavalry
stationed at Columbus, made a re
port. General Funston is reported here
as having asked a number of officers
and men now In Mexico for explana
tions as to the surprise attack at
Columbus.

Prominent Men In Band Of De
fendantsPossum Hunter
Trouble Revived.
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS .MADE
Charging that he had been unlaw
fully assaulted during the night of
April 1C, 1915, severe' beaten,
bruised and maimed, C. W. Darnes,
a well known farmer of this county,
through his attorney, C. E. Smith,
has filed suit for $23,000 damages.
Some of the defendants aro promi
nent farmers and business men and
are alleged to have been members of
tho "Possum hunters' " organization,
several members of which are now
serving terms In the penitentiary
for outrages committed in thl3 coun
ty. There are thirty-five defendants
to the suit, all of whom live In Ohio,
Muhlenberg and Dutlor counties.
They are Claude Allen, Alvls Fulkcr
son, Bob Matthews, Ed Curtis, Gro
ver Brown, Herman Render, Henry
Bishop, Jim Chancellor, Alva Chan
cellor, Marvin Everly, Cecil Fulker
son, Marlon Balls, Clarence Morris,
Jr., Jim Morrl3, Perry Ashby, Dave

ville Stearmsninn, Elzle Allen, Harry
Woodburn, Henry Addington, R. L.
Simmons, Hnskel Kitchens, D. R.
Wilson, Pen Fulkerson and' Rillle
Reck.
It is alleged In the petition that
the defendants were members of
and co-operated with a secret and
unlawful (organization,1 popularly
known as "possum hunters," and
were engaged In the execution of un
lawful acts. It is stated that in tho
year 1913 there was organized in
the counties of Daviess, Ohio, Mc
Lean, Muhlenberg and Butler coun
ties, a secret society known as the
Consolidated Tobacco Growers' As
sociation, bearing this name In some
of the counties, and In the other
counties It was known as tho Amal
gamated Workers of the World, or
"possum hunters." According to the
petition the object of the organi
zation was pooling and selling tobac
co, and that by means of unlawful
force, threats and deception, fully
80 per cent, of the population of
these counties were compelled and
Induced to Join the organization.
Also It Is charged that many persons
who rofused and failed to Join the
organization and actively co-operate
with them .were assaulted, beaten,
whipped and killed In the night time,
by bands of men in disguise, armed
with deadly weapons.
Tho plaintiff states that said so
ciety was In truth an organized band
of outlaws, known as possum hun
ters, and was for tho purpose of in
timidating and alarming persons, in
cluding the plaintiff.
Barnes alleges that In tho year
1915 the defendants "In pursuance
to a conspiracy entered Into between
tho members of the society, unlaw
fully and corruptly confederated and
banded together, and in tho night
time, armed with deadly weapons,
and while In disguise, did assault,
beat, bruise and Injure his hody with
switches, clubs and other weapons,
causing him to suffer great physical
pain and mental anguish, and that
ho still suffers by reason of such
anguish and humiliation, and that
ho has been damaged and asks
Judgment for 25,000."

People's Welfare.
A HIGH TVPE OF PATRIOTISM
Wathlngton, April 13. President
Wilson, speaking at a Jefferson Day
banquet of Democrats from all parts
of the country her.e to-night, prayed
that the United Stntes would not be
drawn into a quarrel not of Its own
choosing, but nsked If tho people
were icady to go In where the inter
ests of America were coincident with
the interests of humanity, and have
the courage to withdraw when the
interests of humanity had been con
served. He was Interrupted by
cheer3 and shouts of "Vcs."
During his address the President
had mentioned the European war
and the Mexican question, without
intimating what were his plans in
either of the problems confronting
the United States.
He declared that in the present
situation the responsibility was with
tho Democratic party, because that
party controls the Government and
that "it is for us" to hold the bal
ance even and not to allow some
malign Influence to depress one side
or the other.
Most of the speech was devoted to
reviewing tho achievements of the
Democratic party during the last few
years and to a criticism of the Re
publicans aa the party with "a pro
vinOM spirit." The President as
serted that the nation was better
prepared then ever before to show
how America can lead the way along
the path of light.
The President declared that he
was not Interested In personal ambi
tion, nor even enthusiastic over par
ty success, but that he was interest
ed in seeing the load depressing hu
manity lifted. He mentioned none
of the Republican leaders by name,
but when he spoke of ambitious men
there were shouts of "T. R."
What the nation demands now,
the President said, is service essen
tially nonpartisan, not only in con
sideration or foielgn nlfairs, but in
domestic affairs as well.
Referring Incidentally to Mexico,
he told of how a man had urged that
trustees of that nation's welfare be
chosen, and of his reply that no na
tion had achieved real prosperity
and happiness for Its masso3 through
a trusteeship imposed on it from
above.
It was the first speech of a politi
cal nature the President had made
for several months, and was deliv
ered before an audience Including
nearly nil the members of his Cabi
n?t, Democratic members of tho Sen
ate and House, Democratic Chn'r
mon of many States and other high
officials of the nation and States.f
gathered to attend the annual ban
quet of tho Common Counsel Club.
Tho President was referred to re
peatedly as "our next President" by
Senators H0III3 and Walsh and Rep
resentative Glass, who preceded him,
mil each utterance of his name was
received with enthusiastic applause.
Senator Walsh spoke of tho Pres
ident ns a man who "bIiuiib war as
tho supreme calamity which can be
fall tho nation," but who neverthe
less prepares for war.
"May God continue to preservo
tho nation In poaco," the Senator adr
ded.
Mrs. Wilson and the wives of tho
Cabinet officers occupied a box dur
ing the speaking.

Gigantic Struggle Enters
Ninth Week
OF UNINTERRUPTED CONFLICT
German Gains Total 100 Square
iMiles French Defense
Still Intact.
A GREAT SVSTEM OF TRENCHES
London, April 16. The most gi
gantic conflict in the history of the
world, the battle of Verdun, has en
tered upon its ninth week. It Is In
many respects without precedent.
The enormous scale of the German
preparations and execution of the
j attack, the unparalleled concentra-
rocity of the lighting, mark the bat
tle as one of the greatest efforts of
the war.
Verdun has been rated as one of
the strongest fortresses of Europe, a
cornerstone of the French defences
against Germany. The evolution of
military tactics during the war, how
ever, and particularly the employ
ment by the Germans of long-range
howitzers capable of reducing the
greatest forts, have done much to
change tho character of the Verdun
campaign as compared with the ear
lier conceptions of what such a
struggle might be. Defore the bat
tle opened the French partly dis
mantled their forts around Verdun,
and here, as elsewhere on the va
rious fronts, chief reliance for re
sistance was placed on an elaborate
system of trenches.
In no previous battle were the
losses so high as those which hnv
been estimated In the fighting
around Verdun. "These estimates,
however, cannot be legarded as con
clusive evidence, for neither Germa
ny nor France has announced Its
own casualties. The French War
Office has declared the Germans have
lost 200.000 in killed, wounded and
captured. The Germans state semi
officially that the French casualties
number 150,000 killed and wounded
and that 3G.O0O unwounded French
I prisoners havo been taken. If these
1 estimates aro approximately correct
'nearly 400,000 men have been ellm
, iuated as fighting units.
The ground occupied by the Ger
1 mans after fifty-six days of offensive
operations may be roughly calculat
ed as 100 square miles. They have
, forced back the French from their
1 outlying positions to their definite
I line of resistance along the semi
j circular front from the edge of tho
j Argonne eastward across the Mouse
I and southward Into the Woevre. For
the most part this main line lias
withstood the shock of successive at
tacks. The Germans captured Fort
Douaumont early In the campaign
and have bitten Into French defenses
I at Dead Man's Hill and elsewhere,
I but at no point have they succeeded
j In breaking through,
j On Sunday of last week the Ger
mans undertook a general onslaught
along a thlrteen-mlte front both west
I and east of tho Mouse, from the
I Haucourt-Bethincourt sector to Dou
nuinont. A high French military of
ficial alluded to this movement as
"an attack on the largest scale since
the beginning of tho offensive." Tho
I Germans announced that within a
I few hours after It was begun Both
1 Incourt nnd two fortified positions
to the southwest wero Isolated.
1 Trenches In tho region of Dead
Man's Hill were carried, but at no
point was tho French Hue broken
through. Toward the end of lst
I week this attack subsided and there
came another pauso, followed by
French counter attacks over small
sections of the Hue.
I Tho failure of tho Germans to
break tho French line in their gen
eral offenstvo of InBt wool; led
French correspondents to assert that
tho German offensive had broken
'down. Dispatches from the Carman
! front, however, state that tho opera
tions aro being carried forward
methodically in accordnnco with tho
preconceived plan nnd with full
measure of tho expected success for
tho German arms.
