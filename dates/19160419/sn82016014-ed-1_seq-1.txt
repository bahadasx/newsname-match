dent Wilson told congress assem
bled in joint session shortly aft
er 1 o'clock this afternoon, he
had given Germany irrevocable
notification that the United
States will break off diplomatic
relations if her illegal submarine
campaign is continued.
A note, America's last word,
practically an ultimatum, and
demanding an immediate reply,
presumably was in the Berlin
foreign office as the president
was speaking. It was dis
patched last night ir. accordance
with the president's plan to have
it before the German govern
ment at the same moment he
was addressing the American
congress.
The president asked no action
whatever of congress. He sim
ply informed it of the accumula

end of diplomatic negotiations. A con
tinuance of the long standing friendly
relations, the president made clear,
depends alone upon Germany's con
duct. Galleries Wore Filled.
Representatives of the allied coun
tries filled the diplomatic galleries of
the house. Women ruled in the pub
lic naileries, less than twenty men
finding places in the six hundred seats.
Mrs. Wilson was in the executive gal

standing until they were seated.
While The senators were taking their
seats President Wilson reached the cap

office just outside the chamber. As
the president entered the chan.ber,
just before 1 o'clock, senators, repre
sentatives, cabinet and galleries arose.
An outburst of applause pave way to
loud cheering. During this demon
stration the president shook hands
with the speaker and the vice presi

I to continue indiscriminate warfare in
defiance of international law and the
protests of the United States', was fol-
lowed by the statement that this deter
I mination had left but one course open
to the United States.
When he pronounced the words of
the ultimatum, declaring that unless
Germany should immediately declare
and effect an abandonment of indis-
to
sever diplomatic relations, there was ;
still no demonstration, only a tense
silence and a reflection of the gravity
of his words.
Cheers Xote of peace.
When he concluded with expression
of hope that Germany would so act
to avert a regrettable break with
America the assembly broke into
cheers. It was 1:14 o'clock when the I
president concluded. He had spoken ;
just fifteen minutes. Applause started 1
from the Democratic side and the Re
publican members then joined.
The president said:
"Gentlemen of the Congress: A I
situation has arisen in the foreign re
latlons of the country of which it is
my plain duty to inform you very
frankly:
"It will be recalled that in February,
1915. the imperial German govern-
ment announced its intention to treat
the waters surrounding Great Britain
and Ireland as embraced within the
seat of war and to destroy all mer-
chant ships owned by its enemies that
might be found within any part of
fhat portion of the high seas and tnat
It warned all vessels of neutral, as well
as of belligerent ownership to keep
out of the waters it bad thus pre
scribed or else enter them at their
peril.
lulled States Protested Immediately.
"The government of the United States
earnestly protested. It took the posi
tion that such a policy could not be
pursued without the practical cer
tainty of gross and palpable violations
of the law of nations, particularly if
submarine craft were to be employed
as its instruments. inasmuch as the
rules prescribed by that law, rules
founded upon principles of humanity
and established for the protection of
the lives of non-combatants at sea,
could not, in the nature of the case
be observed by such vessels. It based
its protest on the ground that persons
of neutral nationality and vessels of
neutral ownership would be exposed
to extreme and intolerable risks and
that no right to close any part of the I
high seas against their use or to ex- !
pose them to such risks could lawfully i
be asserted by any belligerent govern- j
ment.

There is a vacancy in the position of
superintendency of city schools of Salt
Lake City, rtah, and members of the
board of education of that city, in
casting about for a new superinten
dent, have written to a number of
people in this city on the subject.
A letter of this sort is received by
this paper inquiring about the abili
ties of Superintendent Wilson and the
satisfaction he is giving here. A reply
was sent to the effect that Mr. Wilson
had given entire satisfaction, and so
far as v as known, it was the desire of
Topeka people that he remain here
and continue in his excellent work of
maintaining and upbuilding our pub
lic schools. These letters have natur
ally started rumors that Superinten
dent Wilson might leave this city for
Salt Lake.
Superintendent Wilson said today
that he had not applied for the posi
tion; that he was in Salt Lake City last
December and delivered a series of
addresses there before the State
Teachers association of Utah on va
rious modern educational topics.
"There was no vacancy in the office
of superintendent at that time," said
he today, "but since then I learned
that the superintendent has resigned
to go into business. T have no infor
mation that the school board of Salt
Lake has offered me the place. I am
so well pleased with my work in To
peka that I am sure it would take
very large financial inducement, and
the surroundings of such a superin-i
tendency anywhere would have to be
particularly attractive to receive any
consideration from me. There is this
to be said, the board of education of
Salt Jake has taken up the matter
with me and while I am not an ag
gressive applicant for the position, yet
in my conferences with the board, I
gave them to understand that I would

seeking to fill under certain condi

Many old line Republicans who rj
1912 said bitter and unkind thiiu,!
about Roosevelt, have recently con
to Topeka with expressions that they
are willing to follow the action of the
Chicago convention and can enthusi
astically support Roosevelt if he be
selected by the national delegates. It
is due to the desire of the Republicans
of the state and nation to upset the
Wilson rule and establish a new stand
ard of national honor and dignity in
international affairs, that many Kan
sas Republicans have looked to Roose
velt for leadership in the fight next
fall.
Would Take No Chances.
Judge Li. S. Ferry of Topeka Is one
of the men who is seeing the light.
Judge Ferry was bitter against Roose
velt in the 1912-14 campaigns, but he
does not believe in taking chances in
1916.
"If any one had told me a few
months ago that I would be an advo
cate of Colonel Roosevelt for the pres
idency. I would have declared it im
possible," said Judge Ferry. "But
with the recent developments in our
diplomatic and domestic situation, I
find myself slipping, slipping."
T. F. Doran, a member of the law
firm with Judge Ferry both are as
sociated with J. S. Dean, president of
the Republican league is also com
ing over to the Roosevelt cause.
"No man in Kansas hated Roosevelt
more bitterly than I. No man has
been more decided and pronounced in
his views." said Doran. "But this is
a situation which few men can meet.
We need some one with force, convic
tions and purposes. Every day it
looks a little more as though Roose
velt were the man of the hour and I
think I can forget a lot of things in
placing the colonel in charge of our
t policies."

dislike for Roosevelt was at fever heat

Payne's first choice is Burton of Ohio.
But he sees the growing Roosevelt
sentiment and is bracing his feet for
the things that may happen.
"You can't tell what the Chicago
ccwivention will do." said Payne who
is in Topeka attending the bankers
convention. "It may be Roosevelt.

WANT OUR MONEY
Bankers Over the State Are
Anxious for More Cash.
Would Be Glad to Pay Three
Per Cent for It.
Finance Commissioner Wasson is
beginning to receive letters from bank
ers out in the state wanting to know If
the city has any three per cent money
to let them have. They write they are
willing to pay the city three per cent
on its average daily balances and four
per cent on six months time deposits;
that they can use a chunk of the city's
money and will be glad to get it at
these rates and they will put up just
as good security as any bank in the
state can offer.
The city charter granted Topeka ap
parently makes this impossible at
present as it says that all city money
must remain in Topeka banks, or
words to that effect, but the fact has
been made . plain to Commissioner
Wasson in the past two days that the
city is losing many dollars annually by
this restraining clause in the charter.
This subject is treated editorially on
page 4.
In the state house bankers from out
in the state are beginning to talk of
the cheap money m Topeka. Several
of them state they can use three per
cent money in their localities and
would be mighty glad of the opportun
ity of getting it from Shawnee county
funds.

Governor Capper Is a Booster

Governor Capper today decreed a
holiday for state house fans that they
may attend the opening of the West

next Tuesday afternoon. The state
house will be closed an hour in ad
vance of the game and will remain
closed for the day, the governor stat
ed. Governor Capper himself will
probably attend the opening game
with Denver.
For several years state house em
plovees who desired to attend the
opening of the baseball season have
been given a leave of absence. This
year it is probable that a general clos
ing order will be effective. Governor
Capper is opposed to a half day off
for state employees, but favors closing
the state capitol building an hour be

"Certainly I am in favor of every

concerning plans for closing the state
house. "I believe every one should go
to the game. It is a great thing for
the town and a winning team is a
mighty good asset. The management
has made an effort to give the town
a good team and they deserve sup

he favored a plan for closing the state

Practically all of the state officials
will attend the game. Nearly all of

Topeka merchants ought to have and

Don't advertise, gentlemen, alone In

The more people we can get acre to

business all the merchants will do.
You retailers have the stores, the
goods and the prices. Go after your
