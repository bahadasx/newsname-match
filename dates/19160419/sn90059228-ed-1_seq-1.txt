of his promise to North Star College
made a little over a year ago, on
condition that the college raise
$27,000, making a total of $36,000 for

what some of the big publications

Home Journal, $8.00 a line, $104.00
an inch, and $6,000 for a full page
eac3i issue. The back cover page
sells for $10,000. A full page ad

sells for $7,000. The center double

WARREN HAPPY HIKERS' CLUB.
Young Ladies of Warren
Health Giving Movement.
Mere Men Allowed.
Launch
No
On Monday evening, last, about
eighteen of Warren's ambitious young
ladies met in secret conclave no mere
men were allowed, and altho the
young women present are willing to
tell certain things, no one outside has
been able to learn just what was said
and done behind the closed doors.
From the merry laughter which float
ed out through every crack and
cranny, however, it was safe to guess
it was nothing of a doleful nature.
Those who know, freely admit that
early mornings will find them far
afield in pursuit of health and happi
ness. They tell us they will hear the
robins' first early morning call and
see the little blades of grass lift their
heads to greet the rising sun. Oh,
yes, they will, for there is a fine for
sleepy heads and the "just one more
nap."
If you pass a bunch of young ladies
and hear such scraps of conversation
as "six o'clock sharpdon't be late",
"next summer at the lake", "bacon
toasted at a wood fire, and the aid
of two slices of bread and butter
'em-m" you may rightly surmise you
are passing a group of Happy Hik
ers. 4
There are eighteen charter mem
bers and already others have been
asking admission qualifications. Of
course, the young men are) modestly
offering superior wisdom and advise,
butwell, men are not
allowed,
that's all. The following officers
were elected for a period of six
months: President, Nell B. Seign
Vice President, Elizabeth Rankin
Secretary, Jessie Porteous Treasur
er, Emma Jorgenson Sergeant at
arms, Valborg Smeby. There are two
standing committees, "The Breakfast
Committee" and "The Social Com
Jmittee".

DR. J. A. GATES,
Kertyon, Goodhue County.
Dr J. A. Gates, of Kenyon, Good
hue County is receiving much favor
able mention hy. the press of the
state as being just the right kind of
a man for the office of Liutenant
Governor. When a member of the
state legislature some years ago, Dr
Gates made for himself an enviable
record.^ He was the champion for
many important reform measures,
particularly pertaining to public
health/ and was always a saunch
friend of northern Minnesota. He
helpedy pass several measures in
which we in this part of the state,
were greatly interested. During his
visit to our city last week, the doctor
met m^ny of our leading republicans.
The impression he made was very
favorableeverybody seeming to like
his clean cut and honest features
and straight-forward talk. It is safe
to sa^ that Dr. Gates will receive
strong support for liutenant governor
in Marshall county.

CANADA CENSORS U. S. MAIL.
G.W. Smith, of this city, received
a letter from Canada last Sunday
that had been opend by the censor
and t$ie word "Censored" stamped in
bold Tetters across its face. What
reason the Canadian government can
have for opening Mr. Smith's mail is
hard fo figure out. Perhaps it fears
that Mr. Smith has a dreaded Zeppe
lin stuck away in his back yard and
that early some fine morning he will
soar over Winnipeg and bombard the
city from the sky. Or perhaps it is
a submarine attack that is feared,
now that'the water is high and it
would be an easy matter for Mr.
Smith to float one of them "pesky
things" down Snake river and Red
river ato attack Winnipeg by torped
oes ah* guns. Well, who knows what
our peaceful and inoffensive Mr
Smith may have up his sleeve, and
the Wmnipegers, to be safe, better
scrutinize carefully every inch of sky
and every drop of Red river water
from now on until the end of the
war.
According to the Minneapolis Jour
nal this morning the Canadian censor
has^also been guilty of opening U. S.
tesy", not to say "offense", practiced
by some other country, Germany for
instance, one could expect protests
and notes galore from the present
administration. We fail to see why
Canada should suspect any correspon
dence of U. S. officials.

Why Lead Pencils Have No Lead.
Do you know that lead pencils are
not maxle with lead9
Long long
ago lead was used for this purpose,
and the ^continuance of the name is
misleading, but illustrates the per
sistence of the original association.
To-day lead pencils are made with
graphite and have been since this
substance was discovered in 1565.
It is one of the forms under which
carbon occurs in nature. It is soft
and unctuous to the touch, iron gray
in color, and of metallic lustre.
Graphite is dug from mines, and
is rarely found in sufficient purity to
be available for pencil making. Af
ter being purified and pulverized it
is mixed with clay, the proportion of
each depending upon the grade of
hardness desired in the pencil. The
degree of softness depends upon the
relative preponderance of the gra
phite in the mixture, and the hard
ness is in accordance with the great
er proportion of clay. The requisite
degree of hardness depends, too, on
the compression of the mixture into
form ready to be glued into the wood
casings.
Ceylon, Mexico and Europe are the
chief sources of graphite supply. In
this country there
mines at Ticonderoga, N. Y., At
though lead pencils were not made
in the ^United States until 1861.
America manufacturers now supply
nine-tenths of the home demand and
have largely entered into competition
for the world's trade.
NEW CLOTHING
STOREFOR WARREN
Hans Urtes Will Start in Business
For Himself Next Week.
Hans Urtes who has been in
charge of the men's clothing depart
ment in the store of K. J. Taralseth
Co. during the past twelve years, re
signed his position the first of the
month to enter into business for him
self. He has leased the Jacob
Schmidt building on Johnson avenue
for a term of years and in his open
ing announcement this week states
that he will be ready to open his new
store next week. The building has
been provided with a new front and
new furniture and fixtures are be
ing installed. It is the intention of
Mr. Urtes to conduct a model and
up-to-date men's clothing store and
his long experience in the business,
wide acquaintance and genial, trade
winning manners, will be instrument
al in large degree to make his ven
ture a success.
Mr. Urtes is quite a humorist also
and his ad this week is both novel
and original. He represents himself
as a chicken just out of the shell,
confronted with the necessity of
scratching for himself If given time
and nourishment there is no reason
why he should not grow and ulti
mately take his place by the strong
and sturdy chanticleers which now
constitute the progressive and suc
cessful business men of Warren. At
any rate he promises that he will
emit a crow that shall be long and
loud enough to be heard by every
body in Marshall and adjoining coun
ties in need of good clothes.
FLIES COST MUCH IN
DOCTOR'S BILLS.
The fly is one of man's most dead
ly enemies It makes constant war
fare on him, using for amunition the
disease germ. The fly covers the
feet and body with germs picked up
in dirth and filth, flies to the nearest
house, walks acrossjiaby's milk cup,
^then bahy drinks his milk, sickens
and dies.
The thing to do is to remove dirt
and filth, destroy the fly's breeding
places, shut the fly out of the home
and keep it away from the family's
food. This is more effective than
swatting the fly and paying the
doctor's bills, and it doesn't cost so
much.
In th*1
cities the part which filth
plays in disease infection is well
recognized and means are provided
to dispose of waste that may be
laden with germs which may produce
illness. Persons living under rural
conditions are beginning to see that
the health problem there is just as
serious as in the city, and that many
common diseases can be prevented
by the removal of all wast*1
1
are "^portantrt?
S3
'*&*
The
diseases which are more easily car
ried in filth are those of the intest
inal.-tract, such as typhoid, dysen
tery, diarrhoea and summer com
plaint of children. In these diseases,
the germs are abundant in the in
testinal discharges. Where there are
not ''sanitary conveniences for the
disposal of this material so that it
will be covered, flies may carry the
germs back to food or milk or may
contaminate the water supply
Flies delight to feed in filth and
then come into the houses where
they may drop some of the filth into
the food, or may walk over the
baby's mouth and wipe off a few
germs, or they may get into the
milk tins and wash off some of the
germ-laden filth in the milk or leave
spots on the tin to be washed off by
the milk later. Even kitchen gar
bage exposed at the back door may
supply germs which cause diarrhoea.
The usual method of disposal of
farmyard manure gives flies every
chance to develop in large numbers,
for louse flies breed in stable *mcn
ure. The farmer is sti" further ex
posed to danger from the chance
visitoi or laborer on the farm. Many
persons are carriers of typhoid
germs and are discharging them
continually from the D1
\*R4K
adder and
bowls, whence flies can carry them
to ether persons.
The following articles of this series
wi'i show some devices that will
prevent flies from actia as common
carr ers of disease germs from filth
to fcod or its containers.
