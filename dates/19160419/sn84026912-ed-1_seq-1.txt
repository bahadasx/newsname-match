POST OFFICH DRAFT PROPOSED.
Deportment Considering Scheme Sou- | <
gested hy WnlhnllaV Postmuster.
The citizens of Walhalla have're
alized for some time that we have one ,
of the best postmasters in the service
to-day. This fact is not only known
local'y, hut che department at Wash
ington has before now taken cogni
zance of it. Mr. Faut bas inaugurat
ed numerous improvements locally
that have been adopted by other post
masters. Mis most recent proposal
for increased postal efficiency is the
adoption of a "post office draft,"
which is now receiving consideration
in Washington. This information
ernies from Washington by \va> of
a dispatch to the Anderson Mail from
A. M. Carpenter, former editor of
that paper, now a government em
ployee. Ti-" dispatch says:
Postmaster X. L. Fant, of Walhal
la, has worked out a sdheme for a
system of post office drafts, similar to
ordinary bank drafts, which is being
considered by the post oflicc depart
ment, and if it is adopted it will mean
a revolution in the transmission of
ninney from one part of the country
to another.
Postmaster Pant's Idea is to have
the post office handle drafts, and the
method he has worked out seems very
sin.pie. Under it the post office de
partment would place on sale ai all
post offices Whit would be known as
a "draft" application for a money or
der The price would be two cents,
which would represent the return
postage. Here ?B the scheme:
if A wanted a remittance from D
for any reason whatever, and as a
means of inducing B to respond, and
for his convenience, A would buy a
"draft" and mail lt direct to B. if
B honored the draft lie would take lt
to his postmaster with the money,
get attached coupon receipt, that's
all- -the postmaster would do the
test; that ls, he would draw an or
der for the corresponding amount
and mail direct to A under cover of
a penalty envelope.
If B did not honor Hie draft, and
destroyed it, as would be done in
numerous instances, that fact would
not make a particle of difference with
t'ho post office department, as the ]
"drafts" would be paid for in ad
vance.
In instances where an individual
wished to protect another from the
publicity of a bank draft, the money
order draft would be the means, and
In localities wihere there are no
banks tho money order draft would
supply a much needed convenience.
The scheme ls being considered by
i the officials of the post office depart
ment, but as yet no decision bas been
reached as to its adoption.
Mr. Fant ls regarded at the depart
ment as one of the most efficient post
mast-; rs In t'ho country. He'has made
many suggestions for the improve
ment of the postal service, some of
whioh have already been adopted
with good results, lt is but natural,
however, that Mr. Wornt should take
so much interest in Oie service, for he
has never boen engaged in any otlior
business. He began life as a clerk In
the Anderson post office, and was la
ter In the railway mail service for
more than a quarter of a century,
having the run between Bolton and
Walhalla. He was In the latter posi
tion when he was appointed postmas
ter at Walhalla.
"LAST WORD" WILSON SENDS.
As Message Nenrs Completion Word
Conics of Austrian Attack.
Washington, April 17.-The com
munication1 which ho liad drafted as
the last word of the United States to
Germany on the submarine issue was
completed to-day by President Wil
son, lt probably will be dispatched
to Berlin to-morrow.
Tho document reviews Germany's
submr/lne activities since the Lusi
tania was sunk and makes plain that
only an immediate change in the Ger
man policy can make possible the
continuance of friendly relations be
tween the two nations.
As the President was putting the
finishing touches to the note, ofllcial
word was received by tho State De
partment that the lives of two Ameri
cans had been endangered by an at
tack on the Russian bark Imperator,
bound from Gulf port, Miss., for Mar
seilles, France, by an Austrian sub
marine. Clark Bailey Hurst. Ameri
can consul general at Barcelona,
Spain, who sent tho report, said that
the attack was without warning. One
of the Americans was wounded by
shrapnel shells.
Investigation Ordered.
A full Investigation of the incident
was ordered. If tho consul general's
report ls borne out it is probable that
representations similar to those be
ing made to Oerjunny will be sent to
Austria-Hungary

whose names could not bc ascertain
ed, were arrested at Hardeevllle, S.
C., at the instigation of Lieut. A. P.
C ron kb i te, United States engineer

ing, it was said, revealed the Tact that
they were in possession of maits giv
ing minute details of fortifications
and roads along this section of the
coast, and carried an elaborate pbo- i
togrophie outfit.
A charge of vagrancy, on willoh the
men were taken into custody, was
changed to a charge of being suspi

three produced Sr,,OOO to disprove the
vagrant charge.
