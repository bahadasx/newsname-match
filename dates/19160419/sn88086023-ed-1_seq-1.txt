NAMIQUIPA, (By Motortruck to

after the fight at Querrero and may

Namiquipa. He is almost dally re.

apart. The entire territory constant

WASHINGTON, April 19. A

the president's message. Never

cials gave a broad Intimation that
Germany may meet the Ameri

BERLIN, April It. Von Ja
gow today handed to Gerard a
second memorandum regarding
the Sussex cane. Despite the un
easiness over the possibilities of
a break with America, the em
bassy stated that this feeling
had become customary as daily
requests for passports have been
received.
WASHINGTON, April 1. Presi
dent Wilson served notice todsy that
Germany must stop its submarine
campaign Immediately or diplomatic
relations will be severed.
The note has already been cabled.
President Wilson went before con
gress at noon today and read his
special message at a joint session. The
president said:
"A situation has arisen in tbe for
eign relations of our country which
it Is, my plain duty to inform you of
frankly. On February, 1915, Ger
many announced the Intention to treat
waters surrounding England and Ire
land as embraced within the seat of
war and to destroy all merchantmen
found within that zone and warned
neutral and belligerent owners to
keep their vessels from the waters
prescribed The government of the
United States- earnestly protested.
Notwithstanding this, aermany pro-
eeeded to carry out the peUcy
as an

me lives or non-comoatanta j
and t0 respect the rignts of neutrals, j

humanity Whatever the disposition
or intention of Germany, it is mani
festly proved impossible to continue
such methods of attack within .the
bounds either of reason or the heart
of mankind. Last Fewuary Germany
informed the world it would treat
armed merchantmen of belligerent
ownership as auxiliary warships and
destroy them without warning. De
spite solemn assurances, Germany
permitted undersea commanders to
disregard the assurances with entire
impunity. Passengers and crews
have been sacrificed tn a wholesale

nut the slightest color of Justifica
tion." Tbe president characterised tho
Sussex case as a shocking Incident
and touched upon the Lustlanla, case.
"I deemed it my doty therefore to
tell Germany that Is she proposes to
prosecute a relentless and Indiscrim
inate warfare against merchantmen,
this government must sever diplomat
ic relations with Germany altogether.
"The law of nations has long rec
ognized the right of merchantmen to
carry arms for protection and use
them to repel an attack, though at
their own risk. Germany claimed the
right to set these understandings
aside, deeming these extraordinary
circumstances- Even the limitations
set constituted no check upon the de
struction of ships of every sort Great
liners like the Lost tan 1& and the Ara
bic and mere ferryboats like the Sus
sex have been attacked without a
moment's warning, sometimes before
the ship was aware of the press nee of
an armed enemy vessel. The roll of
Americans who tost their Uvea has
grown month by month. If the Sus
sex case stood alone, some explana
tion, some disavowal or some evi
dence of a criminal mistake might be
entertained. Recent events make the
conclusion inevitable that It is only
one Instance of a method of warfare
which Germany has mistakenly ad
opted. The United States always has
accepted the successive explanations
and assurances of Germany as given
in entire sincerity and good faith. Ws
hoped that it would prove possible for
Germany to control the acts of Its
naval commanders and square its pol
icy with the principles of humanity
and the laws of nations.
