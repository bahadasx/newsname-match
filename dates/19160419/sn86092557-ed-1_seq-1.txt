Not Opposed to Submarine if
Used in Accordance With
the Laws of Nations
Fact That Berlin Government Has Failed to Keep Prom
ises Frequently Made Is Pointed Out
Reading of Message a Dramatic In
cident in History.
(By Associated Press.)
^WASHINGTON, April 19?President Wilson told Con
gress assembled in joint session shortly after 1 o'clock this
.afternoon that he was giving Germany irrevocable noti-:
i'cation that the United States will break off diplomatic
gelations if her illegal submarine campaign is continued.
A note, America's las.t word, practically an ultimatum,:
aiid demanding an immediate reply, presumably was in
the Berlin foreign office as the President was speaking.
It was dispatched last night in accordance with the Pres-j
ident's plan to have it before the German government at
the same moment he was addressing the American con
gress.
The President asks no action of Congress. He simply1
I informed it of the accumulation of facts, proving that Ger-;
many's assurances to the United States are being violated,!
that the submarine campaign despite the earnest protest
of the United States is being conducted with renewed vig-j
or in contravention of all laws of nations and humanity,!
. and that he means to sever relations unless it is brought [
within the law.
The diplomatic history of the world shows such a course <
,is almost certan to be followed by war.
The President's note and his address to Congress are!
final. They mark the end of diplomatic exchanges. A
continuation of the long standing friendly relations the!
President made clear, depend alone upon Germany's con-!
duct.
?. At 12:31 the President left the White House for the Cap
'tol. Soon after lie arrived at the Capitol and awaited the
moment to go to the Hall of the House where Senators
and Representatives were assembled. He entered the hall
at 1 o'clock.

The Message
In his address to Congress
President Wilson said:
" A situation has arisen in the for-'
eigii relations of the country of which
it is my plain duty to inform you very !
frankly. It will be recalled that in Feb
ruary. 11)15. the Imperial German gov
ernment announced its intention to
treat the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland as embraced with
in the seat of war ami to destroy all
merchant, ships owned by its enemies
that might be found within any part
of that portion of the high seas and
that it warned all vessels of neutral
as well as of belligerent ownership
to keep out of the waters it had thus
proscribed or else enter them at their
periL
"The Government of the United
Stales earnestly protested. It took
the position that such a policy could
not be pursued without the practical
ccrtalniiy of gross and palpable vio
lations of the law of uations. particu
larly if submarine craft were to be
employed as its instruments inasmuch
as the rule prescribed by that law;
rules bounded upon principles of hu
manity, and established for the pro
tection of the lives of non-combatants
at won. could not in the nature of the
rase bo observed by surh vessels j
It based its protest on the ground \
that persons of neutral nationality and
vessels of neutral ownership would bo
exposed to extreme and intolerable
risks and that no right to close any
part of lhe high seas against their use
or to expose them to such risks could
lawfully be asserted by any hcligercut
government.
The law of the nations in these mat- j
ors upon which the Government of j
the United States based its protest;
Is not of its origin or founded upon
merely arbitrary principals set up by
convention. It is based, on the con
trary. on manifest and imperative
principles of humanity and has long
been established with the ;?ppi>va2
itnd by the expressed assent of all
.civilized nations of the world. Not
withstanding the earnest protest of
our government the Imperial German I
government at once proceeded to carry
out the policy it had announced. It
expressed Ihc hope that danger in-;
volved at any rate, danger to neutral1
vessels would be reduced to a mini-1
mum by instructions which it had is
sued to its submarine commanders
and assures the government of the
United States that it would take every
possible precaution both to respect the.
rights of neutrals and to safeguard tliej
lives of aon combatants.
"What Ims actually happened has j
shown that those hopes were not;
listitied. In pursuance of the policy!
of submarine warfare against com-;
merce of the adversary the comiuan-j
dors of the German under seas vessels
have attacked merchant ships with
greater and greater activity, not only
upon high spas surrounding Great Brit
ain and Ireland but wherever they
could encounter them in a way that
has grown more and more ruthless:
more and more Indiscriminate. As
the months have gono by they have
delivered these nttucks without com
punction against vessels of every na
tionality and bound upon every sort
of errand.
"Some times merchantmen attack
ed have been warned and summoned
to surrender before being fired on or
torpedoed. Sometimes passngers or
crews hail been vouchsafed, the poor
security of being allowed to take to
the ship's boats before she was sent
to the bottom, but again and again
no warning has been given; no escape
even to the ship's boats allowed to
those on board.
"What this government foresaw
must happen has happened. Whatever
the disposition and intention of the
Imperial Ccrman Government it has
manifestly proved impossible for ti
to >.eep such mothods of attacks upon

AUTHORITIES DETERMINED TO
KEEP TOWN CLEAN AFTER
THIS WEEK
, Fairmont will be the cleancst town
j in West Virginia if the latter part of
clean up week is observed as well as
the lirst part. Mayor liowen reports
moist gratifying success in the move
ment and the sentiment of tiie people
in the community seems to be more
active and favorable toward the speedy
and thorough cleaning this year than
ever before.
Most of the citizens have already
I removed ail rubbish and unsightly mat
ter from their property and those who
have not, are pledged to do so before
[the end of the week. Iiach year here
j tofore it has ben necessary for the
(city officials 'o bear the expense or
I hauling away a lot of rubbish, bul this
{season, with the exception of one or
I two places whore no person can be
found who seems to be responsible,'
the city will not have any expense.. |
The thorough cleaning of Coal Run
beneath the South Side bridge last
Spring by the city, has kept that par
ticular eyesore in excellent condition
and nothing will have to be done this
year at that place. Once the town is j
thoroughly cleaned from accumula
tions of the winter rubbish, a strict
enforcement of sanitary regulations
by the Board of Health and the police |
will keep it clean.
