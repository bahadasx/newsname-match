years chief accountant for tlie
federal government in the local
administration of army rule in
the Philippines, waa elected con
troller for Hie coining four .warn.
He defeated John K. Meads, who
has held the of fire for 10 years,

votes. While (Jronen received
almost four times as many bol

2,1.-16.
WOO They'll Line Up.
There Is much conjecture today
over the ninke-up of the new
council. It la practically certain
that Pettit will assume the public
safety office, held for four years
by A. U, Mills.
Oronen, however, announced
himself before the priinnrics as
being a candidate for the light
and water berth. After the pri
maries, lie mado it known that he
WM opposing Woods for the pub
lic works office.
(ironon was chief of the light
and water department five years
ago, being appointed by the coun
cil to fill Nicholas l.nwson's place.
He had charge of the construc
tion of the Nlsqttally power plant,
and |a admirably qualified to take
the light and water position
again.
Iteliiins in Isni-Iy.
James C. Drake, incumbent In
that office, has two years more to
serve. It Is predicted today by
city hall politicians that an at
tempt will be made by the new
council to switch Drake to the
, public works office.
Yesterday's election brought
out practically the same number
of votes as were cast at the pri
maries. Returna began arriving
at 1:66, and wero all In by II
p. in.
Early returns, from downtown
precincts, gave Stoever a lead. As
the outside precincts began ar
riving, however, Stoever fell way
behind, and tinmen and Shoe
maker made gains by leaps and
bounds. Within an hour after
the polls had closed, the outcome
of the election was assured.

125 c A MONTH. THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA. ?!!!L$J? ONTHJ
vol."xnOfoTToT tacoma. warlu SvkiVnesiVay. April B! Sic! i« a copy
MOVING ON
Aj** This is tlie hardest kind of an editorial to write. It is so easy to
say .something that can he misconstrued. lam talking, of course,
about the morning-after-the-clection editorial. The Times whole
heartedly supported three candidates. Those three, it tiini.s out,
were elected overwhelmingly. Naturally my associates and I are
pleased; we wouldn't be quite human if we weren't and I never did
pretend that this paper wasn't human.
a*IX But what I want you Times readers to understand is that we are
pleased, riot so much because our side won, not so much because
our opinion was endorsed by the composite opinion of the citizens of
Tacoma, but because we believe absolutely that the election of Messrs.
Oronen, Pettit and Shoemaker is a step in the upbuilding and ad
vancement of Tacoma.
/TT Another Tacoma .paper, In fact several others of them, have said
that there were no issues in this campaign. We have politely
insisted that there were several issues, elear-eut issues. One wits the
issue of husiness efficiency against pity hall politics. Another was
the issue of the trimmer against he fearless. Another was the old,
old municipal question raised by a franchise-holding corporation that
insists on meddling in city politics. Including something of all these,
was the question whether the people would approve the course of the
present council majority. The voters very emphatically showed that
they did not, and that they wanted a radical i iiiproveinent. Messrs.
Drake and Atkins will do well to study over the returns, ami to take
their lesson to heart.
£~t The campaign was unusually free from pettiness and mean-
ness. Before the primaries the city hall department heads and
employes showed far too much activity, hut since then they have con
ducted themselves very fairly. The one decidedly regrettable ele
ment in the campaign was the attempt to inject religious prejudice.
The result ought io he sufficient to squelch any future manifestation
of that spirit.
|Tf Now with three men of ripe experience, of fine technical and bus
y\ mess training, pledged to efficiency and to the abolition of petty
politics, entering office, Tacoma is more than ever in a position to
take full advantage of this Year of Promise. Let's everybody pull to
gether, forget any sore spots that the day after election may have dis
closed and make the old town hump ahead.
4TT As for Messrs. Woods, Meads and Stoever, personally, The Times
*|| has nothing but good words; in fact, throughout the campaign we
have spoken not one syllable against the individual standing of any of
the three. We hope that in private life they will find work to do that
will he pleasurable and profitable to them and thus profitable to Ta
coma.
ftt A month or so ago I urged that Tacoma make tins a Looking For- .
y,\ ward campaign, get off the <>I<l battlefields or pettiness and
gum-shoeing, THINK OUT the situation and eled men because of
their capability and nothing else. Tacoma made this a Looking For
ward campaign. TACOMA 18 GOING TO ADVANCE ail AND
RAPIDLY. YESTERDAY'S ELECTION WILL GIVE THE
MOVEMENT JMPETUB.
WHOLE CITY UNITES
TO "LIFT THE CURSE"
By Edgar C. Wheeler
Coming generations of native
sons will point with pride to last
night as tho date when 500 red
blooded Tacoma men and women,
after a score or more years of
bickering end resolutlng, heaved
a great heave together in jerking
the curse loose from the Moun

They will wonder how it ever
came about (hat anybody ever was
allowed to insult tlie "mountain
mother" with the name of an en
emy of I'ncle Sam, who never
even saw her gleaming beauty,
and who fought against the great
American leader for whom the
state was named.
Last night in The Times' Jus
tice to the Mountain meeting,
which filled the Commercial
club rooms, the Justice to the
Mountain club, the men and
women ot Tacoma generally and
Commercial club members got to
gether and did big, definite con
crete things for tne mountain.
They determine,) wliole
