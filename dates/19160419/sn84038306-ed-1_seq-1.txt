Paris, 25th March, 1916.
The Democrat:
I am writing to tell you of the
wonderful success and interest of
our trip.
Through our interest In Belgian
soldiers, and our personal acquaint
ance with M. and Mme. Vander Velde
(Belgian Minister of State) we have
found wen doors everywhere.
At La Panne we saw the king,
and had a personal interview with
Queen Elizabeth, my huBband was
taken to the trenches and now we
expect, through the courtesy of the
Minister of War, to retittrn to La
Panne for a more extensive trip
to the front.
Yo« may be sure I will send yon
for the "Democrat" all the interesting
stories possible without, of course,
writing anything of a military na
ture, for of course, of some things
which we saw we would not feel at
liberty to speak,—but I am sure
you will be pleased with the forth
earning articles.
We expect to be back at 15 Strand,
London, W/ C. Engalnd, by the
middle of April.
My next series of articles will be
a little delayed as I shall not at
tempt to write them before returning
to London, so it may be the mid
dle of May before you receive them,
but you can announce them. I can
assure you truthfully, as we were
assured over here, that we have had
privileges that scarcely any ethers
have een privllegbed to enjoy.
I shall do my best to pass on to
Manchester friends that which we
have seen and heard.
Sincerely and Cordially yours,
Edith- F^hfij^fcon.
FI8HERMAN UNARREST BO.
Gale Wheeler of Independence was
taken before Justice A. E. Peterson
of itbis city- one day last week, and
was -.relieved of a small sum of
money, for catching trout on lower
Spring Branch. It appears that Mr.
Wheeler bad caught trout which
were smaller than specified in the
game laws. Deputies Lake and
Preussner made the arrest.
Mr. Preussner asks The Dem
ocrat to state that there seems to be
some misunderstanding in the minds
of fishermen regarding the use of
throw lines with more than one hook.
A throw line with more than one
hook is classed as a trot line, and
can only be used between May
15th and December 1st, and may
not extend mori than half way
across a stream and not obstruct
the free passage of fish. Mr. Preuss
ner tells us thait there seems to be
few instances of malicious violations
of the game laws, but that in nearly
every case it is ignorance of the law.
TELEGRAPH COMPANY CHANGES
LOCATION.
The City offices of the Western
Union Telegraph Company will soon
be removed from the Amfiden drug
store
ir
the Fred Giissendorf build­
ing on Main street. A. B. Cowan,
district Commercial Superintendent of
the company was in the city last
Thursday and Friday and made the
necessary arrangemfnts for the
change. The rapidly increasing
business of the company makes it
necessary for the change. New fix
tures are to be installed in the new
quarters and when completed Man
chester will have a city telegraph
office which will be a credit to the
city.
HENRY J. DENTON.
Henry J. Denton, one of the pio
neer citizens of Delaware county,
and a nrominent railroad contractor,
died Sunday at noon at the home
of his son, Charles Denton, two
miles west of Earlville. Mr. Den
ton had been Jn feebl? health for
