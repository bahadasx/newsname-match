SAX ANTONIO. April IS Brigadier-General Funston is send
ing General Pershing 2,000 additional troops. It is believed that
more will be placed at Pershing's disposal. The men sent comprise
a part of the border patrol. What troops will relieve them has not
been announced.
IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL EXPECTED

further reports from American officers in Mexico before deciding

is apparent that it outlined the situation as requiring action by Wash
ington. It is thought probable that the German situation will have
direct bearing upon the withdrawal. If a diplomatic break with
Germany is foreseen by the administration, it is virtually.ccrtain that
the troops will be recalled immediately. It is evident that the cab
inet is in no mood to force matters in Mexico. The main purpose of
the expedition, the protection of the border, is regarded as accomplished.
MORE REPORTS OF VILLA'S DEATH
EL PASO. April IS. An American mining man controlling in
terests in the Guerrero district has indirectly confirmed reports of
Villa's death. He forwarded the information to Washington and
said he knew beyond question that Villa was wounded at Guerrero.
Knowing Villa's condition and the certainty of his being wounded,
the American said it was highly probable that the bandit was dead.
Consul Garcia declared tonight that he was certain confirmation of
Villa's death would be received shortly.
36 INJURED BROUGHT TO COLUMBUS
COLUMBUS, April IS. Truckmen returning to the border to
day said preparations were being made by the various detachments
in Mexico for any developments. An increased feeling of security
is felt along the border. Thirty-one sick and injured men were
brought here today from the front.

many a man or woman who slept in

the stories, like the one of the hotel

the desire for alcoholics after Federal
