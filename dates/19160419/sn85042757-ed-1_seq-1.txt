Ovr ing to oversight and being crowd
ed tor space, we neglected last week
to mention Fathers' Day at the kinder
garten of Miss Fannie DeGolia the
week before There were present the
following persons: Dr. V. L. Lewis,
Chas. Julian, Prof. Frank March,
Cashier J. S. Reed, S. C. BishoD, Bax
ter Southard and Lee Dunbar. It was
a real treat to see how skillfully the
little folks executed the drills, sang
their simple songs and did their num
ber work. r.very person present real
ized more f lly i:han ever before the
splendid w . k Miss DeGolia is doing
with the lit t io tolks under her care
Wnen they l we her care and enter

had is sure i tell in rapid advance

Two cars or fat hogs have been load
ed here in the t two weeks. There
has been a totni of 26 cars ot hogs
shipped from tuu county the past fail
and winter ibu. rouj:ht close to $30,-
000. All these bogs were fattened on
the acorns in the woods and cost the
owners practically nothing aside from
looking after them. There are plenty
of acorns in the woods yet to carry the
hogs until July and then berries and
such wild fruits will be on hand to fur
nish the needed food to carry them un
til acorns come this fall. There is a
heavy bitter niist in sight for this fall
aside from what sweet mast there will
be. That means abundance of feed for
hogs the coming fall and a good round
roll in the pockets of those who have
hogs, and there are very few farmers
who do not have more than enough to
make their supply of meat for home
consumption. Cashier J. S. Reed
stated to this editor recently that hogs
had brought to this county this year
not less than $45,000 that the people
have deposited with the First National
Bank here, aside from what meat had
been used at home. The hog proposi
tion has become a very profitable one
here as well as sheep and cattle.

The readeA of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure In all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
Influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Cure Is taken internally
and acts thru the Blood on the Mucous
SuVfaoes of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na
ture in doing its work. The proprie
tors have so much faith in the curative
powers of Hall's Catarrh Cure that
they offer One Hundred Dollars for s.ny
case that it fails to cure. Send -for list
of testimonials.

Circulation of Money.
A man made $25 of loose, surplus,
unearned Increment by putting poor
quality in a case of soldiers' shoes he
shipped abroad. As he had lots more
money, made the same way, he gave
the $26 to a head waiter to reserve a
table for New Year's eve.
The head waiter gave the $25 to his
wife, who handled his finances, and
she used $24.95 of it to pay the head
waiter's income tax.
The income tax will be devoted to
supporting a navy to stand off some
country that doesnt like -us any more
because we made poor shoes for Its
soldiers.
As for the odd nickel, that is still
in escrow, as it were, and will be
thus for another generation or two,
when the son of the head waiter will
throw it to the grandson of the shoe
manufacturerer as a start toward a
night's lodging.
Money always goes somewhere.

Tribulations of a Volunteer.
Richard de Gunpowder was an en
thusiast. He was so enthusiastic that
he enlisted in the Harvard Hundreds.
Moreover, he was so very enthusiastic
that he enlisted twice. Then matters
became confused, for he was assigned
to two different regiments. In some
way, however, he managed to per
suade his superior officers that he
would rather be wholly and entirely in
one company than partly in two. So
one of his enlisted selves joined the
other in the same squad. But now he
was absolutely beside himself; every
time he turned around he hit himself
in the back: whenever he was out of
stn hfi trnrl nn his own hftfiln- fiverv
. , - i
time he what should wht could he
do? What would you hare done?
But the captain was cleverer than
you. He selected one of Richard'? en
listed selves and made him an officer.
So now Sergeant de Gunpowder once
more has complete command of him
self. Harvard Lampoon.
Groped In the Dark.
An investigation of the beginnings
of big business men has been conduct
ed for the American Magazine by
Hugh S. Fullerton.
"An astonishing feature of this in
vestigation," he says, "Is that so few
of these men who have attained large
successes remember the turning point
in their lives until it is recalled to
them. They 'never thought of it,' yet
when the idea was explained, every
one of them could put his finger upon
the exact place at which they turned
toward success. It was astounding to
find that the majority of them were
merely floundering through life with
out definite aim or purpose up to that
point and that from that point on they
saw the course plainly and worked
with positive purpose toward an end.
"They were groping blindly and
could not see an opening until it came
almost as an inspiration. Tot each
on with whom I talked claimed to see
clearly the turning points and the op.
portunltlM ot others."
