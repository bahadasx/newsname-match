Administration Waiting for Fur­

suit.
WASHINGTON RELUCTANT
TO FORCE MATTERS
Main Purpose of Expedition Is
Regarded as Accomp­
lished.
Washington, April 18.—Tile admin­
istration is waiting on further reports
from American officers '"n Mexico be
tcre c.eciding whether the expedpcm
seeking Villa shal' be withdrawn or
reinforced for further operations.
Indications at the war department
bore out press reports from the front,
that the pursuit of Villa was tempor­
arily at a standstill.
No Decision'Reached.
President Wilson and his cabinet'
discussed the Mexican situation brief­
ly today in the light of a review of its
military aspects submitted by Gen
Funston. It was announced later that
the situation was unchanged, and the
administration's policy unaltered. One
member of the cabinet admitted, how­
ever, that no flnjfl decision had been
reached as to the withdrawal of the
troops.
Officials would reveal no word of
the report submitted by Gen. Funston.
It was apparent, however, that it out­
lined a situation which required ac­
tion in Washington.
Refuse Details.
Secretary Baker arranged to take
additional advices to the White House
as they came. lie conferred with Sec­
retary., Lansing during the Utle at'iw
liftoh. -N^UhW'wJKld
conference.
It was thought probable though no
official would talk about this phase of
the question, that the German situa­
tion would have some bearing upon
the impending decision. If a break In
diplomatic relations with Germany is
foreseen py the administration, it is
virtually certain that the troops will
be recalled from Mexico immediately
... .European Eventualities.
They would be needed at' home as
mililary prudence would require that
steps be taken to prepare for eventu­
alities in Europe.
The report of Villa's death has not.
been cleared up as yet. Doubt as to
its truth steadily increases, however,
and dispatches from Consul Letcher
at Chihuahua, received today charac­
terized the report as a mere rumor,
without any foundation that he could
ascertain.
The Washington government, as
nearly as I he attitude of the cabinet
can be learned, is in no mood to force
matters in Mexico.
Already the main purpose of the ex­
pedition protection of the border is
regarded as accomplished.
Secretary Baker conferred with
President Wilson at the White House
tonight and later spent some time at
the war department.-'He said there
were no new developments aside from
troops movements, which had been
ordered by Gen, Funston without in­
structions' from Washington.

Fargo, N. D., April 18.—The regular,

SUPPLY OF CRUDE
OIL VERY SHORT
Washington, April 18.—Little hope
for a reduction in gasoline prices is
seen by experts of the bureau ofmines,
which issued a statement today de­
claring that at the present rate of
production, the country's supply of
crude oil will be exhausted in 27
years.
Relief can come, the statement says,
only through development of process­
es for obtaining a larger quantity of
gasoline from crude oil.

PURSUIT OF BANDIT

COMES TO A HALT
San Antonio, Aril 10.—Gen. I"unf
ton is
to Gen. Pershing more
than 2,00(1 additional troops and I hero
in reason to believe even
more
the
will be
disposal of Gen. Per­
shing, if tin.' capaign against Krancis
co Villa is continued. The I
mops
which have been ordered to Persh­
ing's base at Columbus are now on
duty along the border.
The troops selected for Gen. Per­
shing are tiie Sixth cavalry from the
Brownsville district, the Seventeenth
infantry from Eagle Pass, Troop "L"
of the Tenth cavalry from Tt. Apa
cliee, Ariz., and one lmtallion of (he
Twenty-fourth infantry, one company
of which is at El Paso, one at Maria
and another at Fabas. Maria is a
town north of Ojanaga near I he fron­
tier.
In addition to these troops, total­
ing 2,300, Gen. Pershing now has in
his base guard at Columbus, $04) men,
but the necessity of maintaining at
least' that many there is recognized.
Staff officers here were convinced
some days ago that unless Villa is
taken before he gets beyond a point
south of Satevo, the chances of get­
ting him were remote. That point
has been reached and Villa remains
at large—or dead—and to that situa­
tion is added an undisguised hostility
of various Carranza organizations
that army officers here declare makes
necessary the strengthening of Gen.
Pershing's force. Additional troops
are being sent to Gen. Porshing as
much for protection of those already
in Mexico along the lines of communi­
cation as to strengthen the mobile
forces whipping the region south of
Satevo.
Marked hostility lias been displayed
along the line of communication by
Villa's men, and indications have been
numerous that not all the Cafranza
element, both military and civil, were
friendly. Scouts are continuing their
work of locating Carranza troops in
that vicinity.
Little actual work in the chase of
Villa has been done since the Ameri­
can troops were forced into a fight at
Parral.
Says Villa is De^d.
The reports of Villa's death were
indirectly confirmed here today by an
American mining man who controls
large interests in the Guerrero dis­
trict. This man is in close touch
with the American military author­
ities and has forwarded his informa­
tion to Washington, he said.
"I know beyond any question that
Villa was wounded at. Guerrero. I
have received my account of the af­
fair from one in whom I have the
fullest confidence. He tells me that
Villa was shot through the right
knee, the bullet killing* liis horse,
which fell, pinning the bandit under
it and injuringh is left leg. This
was on March 29. After that, I re­

London, April 18.—Pressing their
attacks vigorously by land and sea,
the Russians have captured Turkey's
most important port on the Black sea,
Trebizond. That the joint attack by
the land and naval forces was sharp,
quick and decisive, was indicated by
the fact that a Russian qfflcial com­
munication has just announced that
the Russian land forces at the village
ol' Dronna, seven miles east of Trebi­
zond, when a new announcement of
the fall of the town was made.
The Russians also are continuing
their drive against the Turks in the
region of the Raiburt, to the south­
east, the capture of which town would
result in the joining of the forces
which recently captured Erzerum anil
those now at Trebizond, and give the
Russians a line for a solid advance
work. This is part of the plan for
the isolation of the Turkish forces in
Mesopotamia.

"Are You Ready for the Test?"
Is His Favorite Ap­
peal.
Washington, Anlifl IS.—President
Wilson's determination io lay the sub­
marine issue tomorrow recalls some
of his recent publiq -utterances on his
conception of American duty to hu­
manity. They werp made while the
president was preparing his final
word on the submarine crisis, and
while his words were not connected
with any particular phase of the for­
eign affair, they are regarded as high­
ly significant' now.
"Are you ready -for the test," the
president asked ^liis hearers last
Thursday night at a Jefferson day cel­
ebration. "God forbid
that
choosing and that do
we should
ever become directly, or indirectly,
embroiled in quarrels
not
of our own
not
we feel responsible, to defend, but if
we should ever be-drawn in, are you
ready to go in, only where the inter­
ests of America arc coincident, with
the interests of inattkind, and to draw
out the moment the interest centers
in America and is narrowed from the
wide circle of humanity?
"Are you ready J!$r the test? Have
you the courage tiJui in.? Have, you
acconifn jr -r?r
the balances disturbed are readjusted
for the interests of humanity?"
Yesterday before the Daughters of
the American ItcvoluHon, Ihe presi­
dent declared:
"America, will have Inij.-ollcn her
traditions whenever upon any occa­
sion she fignls merely for herself un­
der such oireuiiislaiices lliat will show
she has forgotten io lighl for all man­
kind, and the onlv excuse America
can ever have fur the assertion of her
physical force is that she asserts il
in behalf of the interests of human­
ity."
The presiden' made the laller re­
mark al a. meeiiii:', Io which he went
directly from work.
HEALTH MICE
Scores Tribune for Its Criticism
of Local Milk Inspec
tion.
Dr. L. D. Bristol, state bacteriol­
ogist, appeared before the Burleigh
County Medical asociation last even­
ing at the Commercial club, and de­
fended the sub-laboratory here and
the health work generally carried on
by the University of North Dakota.
He scored the Tribune for its crit­
icisms of the feeble health adminis­
tration of the local laboratory and
of the university health department.
He was forced to admit, however,
that the administration of the health
affairs of the state from three head­
quarters was not exactly efficiency in
the modern sense that term is used.
Defending the work of the city bac­
teriologist, he scored the Tribune for
not printing a long-winded academic
letter upholding the health adminis­
tration of the university, although the
substance of the letter was given in a
recent article exposing the present
inefficient health administration and
urging a cocentration of the health
laboratory at Fargo, under Dr. Ladd,
who has a national reputation.
In order to check up the efficiency
of the local bacteriologist, a sample
was sent to the St. Paul city chem­
ist, a well known expert. !His analy­
sis and that of the local bacteriolo­
gist were so different that the phy­
sicians were stumped.
After threatening to have the let­
ter sent to the Tribune printed in an­
other paper, the general discussion of
the Tribune's expose of milk condi­
tions and the poor service of the lo­
cal health laboratory were discussed.
Several papers were read on medi­
cal subjects and several out of town
doctors were present.

Washington, April 18.—The German
embassy today demanded of the' slate
department the immediate return of
papers and documents seized by
agents of the department of justice in
New York from the office formely oc­
cupied by Captain Franz .von Papen,
l'e
embassy. At the sanle tlnle, the em­
bassy requested the release of'Wolfe
von Eigel, Von Pa pen's former secre­
tary, arrested by the authorities in
New York on an indictment charging
conspiracy |o 'blow up the Wellaml
canal.
Consul Polk of Ihe stale department
Io whom the representations were
made, at oniv advised .the department
of justice to return the papers and
free Von Eigel unless the offense was
committed before lie became a mem­
ber of Ihe embassy's slalT.
Prinz llat/.feldl, counselor of Ihe
embassy, who made representations,
demanded llial the papers and docii
nienls be sealed and restored without
being photographed or copied. The
action was based upon the ground
I hat Ihe office in which lite seizure oc­
curred, in reality is a branch of Ihe
embassy.
It was id al the embassy thai the.
contents of the papers were unknown
I here, and ihat *'ie demand for their
restoration was made after Von Kigel
had communicated over the long dis­
tance telephone from New Vork.
Teutonic officials appeared to be
surprised on being informed of the re­
lease of Von Eigel which had been
conditionally ordered. They indicated
Ihat they liad been informed the In­
structions for Hie release of the pris­
oners would be unconditional. A
lengthy report on the affair was un­
derstood to have been forwarded to­

Minneapolis, April 18.—The com­
plaining witness, a 17-year-old girl,
took the stand for the state in the
prosecution of Joseph W. Bragdon,
wealthy Minneapolis clubman, who is
accused of offenses against young
girls.
The trial of Bragdon comes as the
result of investigation into the vice
conditions here.
The girl testified that she, with oth­
er girls, had been taken by the de­
fendant to resorts and lonely spots
near Minneapolis, where offenses
have been committed.
The story told by the girl was of
the same sordid nature as that told
at the trial of ivid" Skully, who is
now serving a sentence at Stillwater.
At the opening of the trial this
morning, Bragdon appeared confident
and smiled to his friends and attor­
neys while chatting with them.
During the statements of the girl
