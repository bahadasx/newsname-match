mMW-rv rm T Oil mi
"What aeeK ie.r ine real essence
of life i3 something that eludes the
grasp bf philosopher, the scientist, the
surgeon. Life is a quest; all men are
seekers after something with the ex
ception of a few parasites unworthy of
the name of man. Many seek in vain
and death finds the object of their
search as-far off as when the quest
began. Many at the expense of great
sacrifice have given themselves over
to search after something and having
found it, their lives end, not in a sun
burst of joy, but in disappointment
and sorrow. Our future is being
wrought and by our hands. What seek
ye? Eternity will contain those things
we have sought for here. In view of
the fact that we cannot go back to cor
rect mistakes we ought to be exceed
ingly careful of the choices we make
now.
The subject for the evening talk
was "Jesus' Search for Lost Men."
From the parables of the lost sheep,
the lost coin, and the prodigal son,
were shown the value Jesus places
upon a soul an1 the patience with
which He searches after the lost The
talk closed with an earnest appeal to
recognize our lost condition and return

Vermont Notes.
A net loss of 77 is the record of the
year for the department of Vermont
Grand Army of the Republic, as given
at its 49th annual session, now in ses
sion in Burlington. The total member
ship is 1,725 now, ' as against 1,802 at
the beginning of the year. There were
ceatns. the number , ot posts in
Vermont is now 86, none having sur
rendered their charter during the year.
The sum of $90,000 has been given
by Henry W. Putnam, jr., to build the
new Putnam Memorial hospital in
Bennington and the money becomes
available as fast as needed to pay for
constraction. This splendid gift comes
entirely unsolicited and is made by Mr.
Putnam to add to the magnificent pres
ent! of the waterworks system made
by his father, Henry W. Putnam, three
years ago.
Commencement honors at St. Johns
bury academy have been announced.
Miss Mary Cheney Carpenter of St.
Johnsbury winning first place and Miss
Gertrude Howe Cramton of St. Johns
bury, second. The scholarships offered
by the University of Vermont fcr the
boy and girl winning the highest place
in the college preparatory department
were awarded to Leighland F. Parker of
Island Pond and Miss Mary C. Carpen
ter. '
The Vermont state forestry depart
ment has recently received from
Messrs. C. C. Putnam and Ralph
Putnam, a deed of 300 acres in the
town of Worcester adjoining the area
given by them to the state last year.
The arrangement made in this case is
that the department will exchange
nursery stock, of which there is a sur
plus in the state nursery, for this land.
In this way land if acquired without
direct expense to the state and more
nursery stock is planted than would be
otherwise. This has now become the
second largest state forest with an
area of 1.400 acres. The Mansfield
forest, with an area of 5,000 acres, is
the largest owned by the state.
Frank E. Rodliffe, a well known
electrician of Burlington is dead as the
result of inhaling gaseous fumes while
at work in an electric light plant at a
summer home located at the northern
most point of Grand Isle. Silas Bushey
of Grand Isle, Rodliffe's assistant, who
was found unconscious beside him, will
live. The men were engaged in re
charging the storage batteries of the
light plant, beginning Friday after
noon. They were discovered uncon
scious at 6.30 Saturday morning. Rod
liffe never regained consciousness.
Bushey says the last he remembers
Friday night was seeing Rodliffe put
up his feet on a railing near the charg
ing apparatus and apparently drop off
in a doze.. After that everything is a
blank. The theory is that the fumes
from the acid solution in the batteries
escaped and slowly overcame the two
men. It is not supposed that gasoline
fumes were responsible, although they
might have helped.

day afternoon of last week. Needless
to say, the young people had a good
time. Thursday afternoon the pupils
of the grammar school went to a
sugaring-off at Philip Rollins' and
they had "the time of their lives."
The Apollo club was entertained
Wednesday evening by Bessie Stone
and Hazel Brahana at tfce heme of
Mrs. Nelson. The program consisted
of Latin and B. A. songs, papers cn
Roman amusements, education and
books of the Romans, a Roman home
and the Roman marriage customs, and
a magazine guessing contest in which
George Chase won the prize, a box of
talcum powder. Refreshments were
served by the hostesses, and the six
teen members of the club who were
present voted that it wTas one of the
most enjoyable meetings ever.
The"pupils of the high school enjoyed
a sugaring-eff party at tfce farm of
Mr. Govro Tuesday afternoon. In
spite of the tact that tne roaa was
covered with mud Knee-deep, the pupils
enjoyed the three-mile walk to the
farm. There were a few accidents on
the way, such as getting the feet wet,
the skirts splashed with mud and the
trousers soiled (?) through contact
with the mud (which happened in the
case of one boy). While waiting for
the sugar to boil, the boys furnished
excitement by a Enowball fight and
the girls, well ! they just looked on.
At last the sugar was done and every
body, or rather every "two-body"
had their pail cf snow and all the
sugar they could eat. It was a sweet
crowd coming home and everybody
felt grateful to Mr. Govro for the
invitation to the sugaring-off and for
the sugar.

LETTER FROM OREGON
This week we publish a letter which
was written to the commercial geogra
phy class by a school girl of McMinn
ville, Oregon. This letter shows little
personal traits of human nature and
ought to appeal especially to the girls.
McMinnville, Oregon,
March 4, 1916.
Miss Theda Dunham,
Barton, Vermont,
Dear Miss Theda:
President Riley's secretary brought
me your very interesting letter yester
day. Vermont is a state which has
always appealed to me, and your de
scription of sugaring and of quarrying
took me right there. You would be
astonished to find how many here do
not know what maple sugar is, nor
where it comes from.
I am living at the home of the v
ogy professor. When I to'-"
your letter she said, "TU
