which is so!I'-explannlorv:
Dear Sir:— I notice in the last
i.-siif of the Fore.-t City I'IVSS, the
Miiicle burnt copied in .several
other State papers, that the charge
is made that the Indians who have
relatives at the Agency Ilo-pital
are in (he hahit-of camping in the
neiii'hljorhood and the (ioveinmeut
is l.n. ini£ compelled to issue mi!
sistenee to them while they camp
around the hospital.
There is absolutely no truth in
his statement whatever, as none
of the Indians have been camping
near the hospital or vicinity, nor
have any subsistence supplies been
issued to such people by the (iov
ernment.
The, charge that these Indians
are imposing upon the Govern
ment in the above manner is a
most unfair statement. A number
of the Indians from distant parts
of the reservation have brought
their sick relatives to the hospital
for treatment, but any who have
remained in the neighborhood of
the Agency on this account, have
done .so at their own expense.
will thank you to correct this
statement in your next issue.
..Very respectfully,
A. F. C. Greene.
A cling Superintendent.
The original article in the Press
wns not written with tht intention
of casting any reflections on the
Hospital management, but more as
a, "joke" on the Indians, who still
retain some of the trails of their
ancestors. One of these is the
practice of visiting relative? and
I ri r- an r-t a in a I ge 111
an
they huuld. The vi&ituig is all
right, but many of the Indians ex
tend their visits over night, and
frequently for several days at a
time, whereas the progressive and
industrious people make their
visits mostly in shapeof short calls,
and seldom think of staying with
their friends oyer night.
We notice that some of our ex
changes have rewritten what The
Press said on the subject and in
doing so said more about it than
The I'ress did.
Among the candidates who are
now commencing to conic to light
in Potter county is Mr. Elmer
Ncwlaud, of Gettysburg, whose
announcement appears in another
part of this issue. Mr. New land is
well known as one of the early
pioneers of the county, having
come here thirty three year.- ago,
and the Press can endorse the fol
lowing commendation of him which
we piotc from the Inst issue of the
Potter County News:
"Elmer New-land is announcing
candidacy for the Republican nom
mation for the office of Register
of Deeds. Mr. Newlancl is one of
the best known men in the county,
having been a resident of the
county for thirty three years, dur
ing most of which time he was en
gaged in business in Gettysburg.
Jle has always been a heavy tax
payer, and this is the first time in
the years during which he has made
his home here that he has asked
for a county office. Ilis reputation
as a conservative and successful
business man. and a substantial
.'itizen, will undoubtly bring him
the support he deserves at the
polls."

miRYBOAT
TIME-TABLE
Imliaih a I Last GranletJ Concession
as to Tolls on Ferryboat
The following schedule of char
ges and runs has been adopted by
the Agency authorities, for the
ferryboat •'White Swan." There
are, a number of interesting feat
ures about, it. especially to old
timers, who have waited for years
in hopes of seeing a good service
which was some approach to what
your "Cucle Sam" was capable of
doing. The concession in favor of
the Indians is .something they have
felt due them ever since the gov
ernment went into the ferryboat
business at this point, as the ori
ginal purchase of the boat was un
doubtly done by the use of Indian
funds.
The new departure regarding
the carrying of passengers will be
a great accomodation to many

April, 1, I'.'H
A large and interested au
dience attended the literary
exercises at the schoolhouse, as
per announcement last week,
and the different uumbers were
heartily appreciated, all being
well rendered. Several of the niiin
Iters were encored, specially those
given by the Misses Johnson and
Miss Ruth Ward, of Gettysburg.
These young ladies were possessed
of well-trained elocutionary powers
which made the program of a high
order, and reflected much credit,
on the ladies, as well as the teacher
of the school, Mr. Wendell John
son. The debate was also a well
executed number, and the judges
decided in favor of the affirmative,
that Geo. Washington was greater
than Abraham Lincoln, by a vote
of two to one. The judges chosen
wore Messrs. C. B. Rosa, H. J.
Eidam and Will Merrill.
The term of school will close
with this week, and The Press re
grets to learn that Mr. Johnson
does not expect to apply for the
school again. He will put in bis
summer's vacation on a farm near
Carpenter, S. D., where he ex
pects to remain until after harvest,
and theu take up some other
otudies again.
