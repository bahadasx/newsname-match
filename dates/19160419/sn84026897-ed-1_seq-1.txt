First Division W. M. U. Meets
at Bethany.
An invitation to Bethany church
to any kind of gathering is enticing,
but when it is a meeting of the
Woman's Missionary Union along
any Hue of work, the invitation
would never be refused if there was
any possibility of accepting it.
Sunday was the day set apart by
the first division president, Mrs. B.
N. Talbert, as the time for the
meeting at Bethany, and letters
urging attendance had been sent
out by her several weeks in ad
vance, as a consequence Bethany
church was tilled with men, women
and children interested in the cause.
Several of the churches were repre
sented and made very good reports
of the work since the annual meet
ing at Clark's Hall, Mrs. Talbert,
presiding very graciously over the
session. Mrs. Y. M. Faulkner, of
Mountain Creek society conducted
the devotions and spoke of her early
and beloved associations with
Bethany, and that her sainted pa
ieras were buried in the city of the
dead adjoining the church,
Mrs. J. L. Mims made an expla
nation of the Standard of Excel
lence and the model member.
A very pleasant feature of the
programme wa? thc singing by Mrs.
Talbert's Honor' Roll Sunbeam
Band, singing the Sunbeam song
and others. Joe Major Lyon sang
a solo, on request, having distin
guished himself last fall at Clark's
Hill.
Mr. J. L. Minis made a practical
talk on the subject of missions, and
a collection was taken amounting to
more than ?5.?5 which will help
the Bethany society to meet their
apportionment.
Mr. Leland Talbert delivered a
most cordial and courteous invita
tion to partake of the bountiful din
ner spread under the treej by the j1
loving hands of the women, and j
aided by the splendid men who are;e
always on hand to lend their aid.
Early after dinner the people as
sembled in the church tore-organize
the Sunday school under the leader
ship of Mr. Bart Talbert who has
been the faithful superintendent for
a number of years. At three o'clock
the pastor, Rev. Mr Smith, arrived,
having rilled an engagement at an
other church in the forenoon, and |1
preached on the subject of missions.
Mr. Smith is greatly beloved by
the peopie of Bethany and is doing
effective work among them.
A most delightful visit was made
by the writer and Mr. Mims at the
home of Mr. ami Mrs. B. K. Tal
bert, having taken shelter under
their roof for the night, and al
though they were fully in
structed not to prepare supper, they
served a very bountiful and appe
tizing meal which was enjoyed in
spile of the fact that the travellers
declared themselves not hungry.
Another pleasant visit of a half
hour was spent with Mr. and Mrs.
C. C. Fuller on the return trip to
Edgefield on Sunday afternoon, and
it was very gratifying to find Mrs.
Fuller so improved in health, and
so cheerful and patient under her
long siege of illness.
All the people in this section are
greatly enthused, and naturally so.

establishment of McCormick coun
ty was declared yesterday by an en
bane session of the supreme court
to have been legally held. There
ire now 45 coontie-; in South Caro
lina, the new unit bavins: been
recognized by an act of the legisla
ture. The decision by the court
means that all constitutional re
quirements have been mr;t for the
creation of the new county. The
en bane session of the supreme court
was attended yesterday by a large
number of advocates of the new
county. The new unit will be made
up from parts of Edgetield, Abbe
ville and Greenwood counties.
The new county movement has
been carried after a ficrht extendinjr
over a period of 20 years. Citizans
of the new county are making ar
rangements for a celebration at
McCormick county. Yesterday they
extended an invitation to Gov. Man
ning to attend the celebration. The
governor was forced to decline be
cause of other engagements.
The election was held last year.
An appeal was taken to the State
board of canvassers and the election
was declared to have been legally
held. Then the ease was carried
on to the supreme court. After
hearing the arguments and gi vi hf
the matter much consideration the
live justices of the supreme court
failed to agree and t^e circuit
judges of the State were called to
their assistance.
The majority opinion was writ
ten by Associate Justice Hydrick
and was concurred in by Associate
Justice Frasier and Circuit Judges,
Prince, Shipp, Sease, Ricn, Bow
man, Smith and Peurifoy. The

inson and others against R. M. Mo
Cown and other members of the
State board of canvassers.
In 10U5 an election was held and
carried by a majority of four to one
in favor of McCormick county, but
the opponents won out in the courts
because the required area was lack
ing. At another election in 19.14
the new county agitators won by a
vote of six to one, but for the sec
ond time it was set aside by the
courts. The last in 1915 won out
by a big majority.
McCormick, the county seat of
the new county, is located on the
Charleston cfc Western Carolina
railway, 43 miles above Augusta
and 25 miles from Abbeville, Green
