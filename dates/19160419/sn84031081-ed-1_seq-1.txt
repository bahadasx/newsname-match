Kl Paso, Tex.. April 18. The re
ports of Villa's death were indirectly
confirmed here today by an Ami
enn mining man who controls- large
Interests in Guerrero district. This
nmn Is in close toucn witn mw .vi.e .
leaii military authorities nnd has for
warded his information to Washing
tan. Ho said: ,
Relieves Villa l ad.
' "i Knw uevond any uuestlon of
,ln,ibt that Villa was wounded ut
Guerrero. I have received, my ac
count of the affair from a man in
whom t have the fullest confidence.
He tells me that Villa was shot
through the right knee, the bullet
killing hits horse, which fell, pinning
the bandit under it and injuring ills
left leg. This was on March !!. Af
ter that 1 received daily reports about
Villa's movements up to April 5, when
he was at Satexo. Since then I have
heard nothing about him. Knowing
his condition and tho certainty of his
being wounded I consider it highly
probable that he is dead, as he as
Burcdly could not have got any prop
er medical treatment."
Blow to intervention. j
Additional weight was given to this
statement in view of the fact that the
man who made it is frankly in f-uvnr
of Intervention and regrets the death
of Villa as a blow lo his hopes, 8,1 It
would mean the withdrawal of the
American troops.
Significance is also seen in the at
titude of the Mexican officials here
and in J uarer., who have never abated
their confidence -in the truth of tho
r-port of Villas death.1 In spite of
the incredulity of General Bell and
other American officers and offlcluls.
Consul GaMa has maintained stoutly
that the bandit is dead. He declared
tonight that he was certain confirma
tion of the ending of Villa's career
would be received here very shortly.
El I'aso skeptical.
The portion taken by Consul Gar
cia and General Gavira has somewhat
shaken the confidence of the skeptics
but the general attitude in El Paso
is still one of watchful waiting.

The attorney for Mrs. Kills renewed
the contentions which were made at
tho trial, telling how the troubles of
the couple began in 1913, when the
wife brought divorce proceedings In
a Massachusetts court and secured the
custody of her child, and how in the

daughter and es aped to Japan, where.
he secured a position as a

Counsel for Mr. Kills argues that

court was asked to consider carefully
whether the mother would make the
more acceptable guardian, arid to con

Further evidence will be taken on
