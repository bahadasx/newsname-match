The cost of schooling m Columbia
is touiparativclj low, .u muling to sta
tists for 1911-1.", gathered bj K H.
Cauthorn, principal of Columbia High
School Willi the exception of St.
Louis, Kansas Citj anil St Joseph,
onlj four cities of more than 5,000
population paj less than Columbia for
high school teachers in proportion to
number of pupils
The teacher-cost-per-piipil-per-month
of Columbia is ?.' SS The four cities
which have a lower cost are: Webb
Citj, $2 CI ; Moberlj, $'..M; Kirksville,
$.'..'.:, Hrookfield, $2 .V! Fifteen cities
have a higher cost, the highest being
Cape Girardeau, with a cost of $G93
Of the four cities with a lower cost
than Columbia three h ive more pu
pils for each teacher Kirksville, a
normal school town, has about the
same number of pupils for each teach
er as Columbia has.
Mr Cauthorn gives two reasons for
Columbia s keeping up a first-class
high school at such a low cost The
first is that Columbia hasn't the
monei with which to paj teachers
higher salaries Mali parents move
to Columbia with a famil to send to
school, rent a house, and do not pay
taxes The second leason is that
teachers like to teach here Three
new teachers were hired Mondaj night
bj the school bo.ud at salaries lower
than the are getting where the are
tins jear.
M.ui teachers want to come here
in order to do work in tlie Pniversit
lor ineir masters degrees. Others
move here to teach so as to enable
othei members of the famil to at
tend the I'niversit Universitv stu
dents who hive been here three or
four ear like to remain and will ac
cept smaller salaries here than else-
wheie.
Although Columbia ranks ninth in
population among Missouri cities out
side of the three largest cities, it
ranks in high school enrollment,
third; m number of teachers, third;
m pupils to tlie teacher, ninth; and
in teacher cost for each pupil, six
teenth Accurate measurements in et
ficieuc are impossible, but Mr. Cau
thorn would put Columbia not far
from the top
