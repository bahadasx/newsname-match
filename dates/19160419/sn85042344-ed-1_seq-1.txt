to congress. I'p to the present
time it had lecn thought ho
would send this communication to
Hcrlin. It was decided, however,
that the situation had become so
serious as to require more drastic
steps.
No official of the administration
would say del'inlately what course
had heen decided upon. Somo
kind of communication will no
forward to Berlin probably to
morrew, but apparently no ono
but the president and the mem
bers of his cabinet know what it
will be.
It has been stated and reiter
ated that before taking liny steps
tending to lead to u rupture in
diplomatic relations or war the
president would lay the situation
r0 before congress. On this account,
when unofficial word of the na
ture of the message to be delivered
tomorrow began to circulate, it
was taken for granted on both
sides of the capitol that drastic
action was impending.
WASHINQTON, April 18. Presi

Soon after noon today and Just
after the cabinet had departed, tho

WILD SCKXKS
WASHINGTON, April 18.
An army lTorjraniation
bill that would produce regular
army and reserve military forees
in the United States aggregating
a million men was passed by the
senate tonight without a record
vote. It is a substitute for the
Hay bill passed by the house and
the differences will be worked
out in conference.
On the eve of a joint session
of the houses of congress to hear
a message from the president on
grave international issues, the
senate hastened completion of the
bill amid scones of excitement, re
peatedly rejecting all amend
ments pending to reduce the pro
posed strengthening of the army.
WASHINGTON, April 18. Bound
by a parliamentary agreement to take
v. final vote on tho army reorganiza
tion bill before adjou.nment. the sen
ato settled down tonight for a pro
tracted session which some leaders
thought might lur.t until far beyond
midnight. Many amendments re
mained to be disposed of when the
usual hour for adjournment passed,
although some of tho most Important,
including one passed late in the day
fixing the peace strength of the stand
ing army at 2l.t00, were out of the
way.
The amendment making the army's
peace strength 1 50,000 instead of
180,000 as provided In the hill as
framed by the military committee,
was ndopted 43 tr 37, 'ii Republicans
and 21 DemocraIn voting' for it. A
peace strength of on'y 140,000 is pro
vided for the army bill passed by the
house, and a sharp contest over that
feature is looked for In conference.
Reserve Regular Army.
Another amendment ndopted today
would create a reserve regular army
for use in time of war. composed of
school and college youths and would
provide a means of recruiting the
proposed volunteer army force.
The proposal submitted by Senator
Hard wick was agreed to, 56 to 24. the
result coming as a surprise to sen
ators on both sides of tho chamber,
since predictions openly had been
made that tho volunteer army feature
already Included In the bill would be
rejected In conference.
Military Instruction.
Senator llardwlck's amendment
provides for military instruction by
commissioned army officers under di
rection of the secretary of war in
every school and college in the United
States having ono hundred or more j
mnle students over fifteen yenrs of
age, when authorities of such schools
apply for such instruction and the
requisite number of students agree to
accept th training and to become a
part of the reserve force of the army
of tho nation. Application for the
training would be purely voluntary,
but all students over 18 years old re
ceiving training would be subject to a
call to the colors by the president In
time of war or threatened war during
their training term.
The senate also agreed to an
amendment reducing the proposed
term of enlistment In the regular
army from seven to five years and
tho proposed term with the colors
from four to two, thus giving each
enlisted man three yean; in tho reg
ular reserve.
Increase Offhi-rs.
Senator Cummins' amendment to
increase the number of officers In
the ordnance department to 126 In
stead of the 85 us at present or 109
provided for in the bill was defeated,
as was the Hitchcock amendment to
fix the number of officers on the
general staff at fifty-two instead of
at thirty-eight as at present, or
ninety-seven as provided In the bill.
An amondment by Senator Reed pro
hibiting enlisted men from leaving
their posts to engage in any civil
pursuit for hire or otherwise, when
it would interfere with the employ
ment of civilians, was passed.
Upon motion of Senator Thomas
an amendment wim adopted making
it a criminal offense for civilians,
with certain exceptions, to wear an
army uniform or to refuse admis
sion to places of public entertain
ment to enlisted men in uniform.
Another amendment adopted would

Incident.
SAN ANTONIO. Texas. April 18.
General Funston is sending In
General Pershing more than two
thousand ndltlonal troops and there Is
reason to believe that even moro will
be placed at the disposal of General
Pershing If the eampaiun against
Francisco Villa Is continued. Tho
troops huo been ordered to Per
shing's base at Columbus, ami ure now
on duty along the border. What
troops will reli ve them and where
they will come from remains unan
nounced. It may be that the war de
partment will have to n 'thorlc tho
rending of the few remaining troops
in the United States Into this depart
ment or It may be that the filling of
the vacant points along the border
may be left to the government of
lexas, which mi.y send the militia.
The troops selected for General
Pershing ure the SiMh civalry from
the Itrownsville district, the Seven
teenth Infantry from Eagle Puss,
troop L of the Tenth envulry from
Fort Apache, Ariz., and one battalion
of the Tw 'iity-fourth Infantry, ono
company of which Is at El Paso, ono
at Marfa and another at Fabens.
Marfu Is : town list north of Oiinaga
on the Mexican lrontier anil Fahcns
is on the Itlo Grande only u few miles
from Kl Pnsn.
In udditloii to these troops, total
ling 2.300. Genernl Pershing now has
in Ills base guard at Columbus eight
hundred men, but the necessity of
maintaining at least that many there
is lecognized.
More Troops Neeileil.
General Pershing requested mors
Iroops some :lni" ago. but General
Funston hesitut-d to order them be
cause faced with 'he danger of weak
ining garrisoned i, in' patrolled points
along the border. He has euthorlty
lo move such troops In his department
us he wishes, but the strengthening of
uny point from another department
tests with the war di partmelit.
Stuff officers here were convinced
some days ago that unless Villa was
taken before he got beyond point.
within a short distance south of Sa
tevo tho chances of getting him were
remote. That point has been reached
and Villa remains at large or dead
und to that situation Is added an un
disguised hostility of various Car
ranza organizations that army men
here declare makes doubly necessary
the strengthening of General Per
shing's force.
Pursuit Slow.
Rut even with more troops the
pursuit of Villa will he a slow and te
dious Job If his trail is extended south
ut the state of Chihuahua. In tho
opinion of army officers who say that
the trails beyond Satevo make ac
cordingly difficult the operation of
military supply trucks. An advantage
could be gained by the list? of a short
er route either through ojinaga or
Fabens but this plan, it was reported
from Washington, would be unaccept
able and the remaining plan and
what military men reward as the only
logical plan, the use of the railroad
south from El Paso, appears out of
the question because of Carranza's re
fusal to permit It and the reluctance
of the administration to authorize ltd
seizure,
I'or Protection.
Additional troops are being sent to
General Pershing as much for the
protection of those already in Mexico
along the line of communications as
to strengthen the mobile forces whip
ping the region south of Satevo.
Marked hostility has been displayed
along tho line of communications by
Villa's men and indications have
been numerous that not all the Car
ran.a element, both military and civil,
