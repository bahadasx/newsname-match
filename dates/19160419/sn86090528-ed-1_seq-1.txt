Wellington, April lft. President
AVilson left the White House for the
rapitol at 12:'M). At onc'clock he be
gun his address beforo tho Joint ses
sion, telling congress of tho communi
cation on Bubmarine warfare, just sent
to Berlin, which may mean the break
ing off of friendly relations between
the two nations. He read his message
in the hall of the house of represent!!
lives, concluding his address at 1:10.
The president Bpoke as follows:
"A situation has arisen In tho for
e Ign relations of the country of which
it Is my plain duty to inform you. It
will be recalled that In February. 1915,
the Imperial German government an
nounced Its intention to treat the wa
ters surrounding Great Britain und
Ireland as embraced within the state
of war and to destroy all merchunt
nliips owned by its enemies found In
that portion of the high seas, and that
Germany warned all vessels of neutral
ownership to stay out of the waters
thus prescribed or cuter them at their
peril.
Protest! Unheeded.
"The government of the United
States earnestly protested against
this action. In pursuance of their iol
icy of submarine warfare, despite the
solemn protest of this government, the
commanders of German submarines
attacked merchant ships with greater
and greater activity wherever they so
could encounter them, In a way that
has grown more and more ruthless
and they have delivered uttneks with
out compunction against vessels of!
every nationality and bound on every
sort of errand. Sometimes passen
gers and crews wero vouchsafed the
poor security of being allowed to take
to the ships' boats but again no warn
ing was given' and they wero not al
lowed to escape."
The president concluded his address
by declaring that "unless the impe
rial German government shall now Im
mediately declare and effect abandon
ment of its present methods of war
faro against passenger and freight car
rying vessels, this government can
have no choice but to sever diplomat
ic relations with the government of
tho German empire altogether."
This declaration camo as the climax
of a message to congress in which the
president delivered tho most severe
Indictment of the German submarine
campaign.
"This docision I have arrived at
with the keenest regret," tho presi
dent said. "Tho possibility of the ac
tion contemplated I am sure all
thoughtful Americans will look for
ward to with unaffected reluctance"
In his address tho president traced
tho cburso of submarine warfare and
negotiations since Germany first de
clared the waters around England and
Ireland a restricted area, warning
ships of whatever ownership to enter
at their peril. ' He pointed out how
this government had earnestly pro
tested. "Great liners like the Lusi
(ania and the Arabic and mere ferry
boats liko the Sussex have been at
tacked without a moment's warning,"
tho president said. He declared that
tho lives of non-combatants and pas
sengers and crews had been sacrificed
In a wholesale manner which tho gov
ernment of tho. United states cannot
but regard as wanton and without the
slightest color of justification. In the
course of his message the president
reasserted his stand ou.the armed
merchantman decree.
No Ultimatum.
Tho note to Germany demands an
Immediate change in methods of sub
marine warfare if friendly relations
are to continue. The president this
morning conferred with Stono and
Flood, chairmen of the foreign rela
tions committees of the two houses,
and with Senator Lodge and Itepre.
sentative Cooper, tho ranking Repub
lican members of tho two committees,
apprising them of the contents of this
note and speech and they approved
his course. It was stated that the note
Is not an ultimatum, carrying no spec
ified time limit..

DELAY IN
PURCHASE
OPPOSED
Alderman Hayes Thinks Council Should
Conclude Deal for Motor Fire Ap
paratus at Once; States
Reasons for Position
In the matter of tho purchase of the
auto fire fighting equipment, follow
ing the authorization of that purchaso
by tho voters of tho city, a diversity
of opinion seems to be manifesting It
self among the several representative
business men of the city as to wheth
er or not the equipment should have
been purchased outright at the meet
ing of the city council which immedi
ately followed the election.
At that meeting of- the council tho
members went Into executive session,
as stated in tho Express at tho time,
for tho purpose of opening the bids
of different manufacturers of auto
matic engines and to listen to the pro
and con arguments of the representa
tives of tho companies competing in
the matter.
The records of tho cdty clerk, enter
ed from the minutes taken, at tho time
of and during the executive session
show that the matter of making the
purchase outright at tltat time was
taken up and put to a test vote with
the result that it was voted down and
the appointment of a special fire com
mittee of five, including: the mayor
and the fire chief, was authorized.
The vote authorizing the appointment
of this committee also providing that
the council should abide by tho find
ings and report of the committee,
which it was further provided should
be made at the next regular sossion
of tho council unless that body should
be sooner called together upon order
of the mayor.
During the sitting of the council in
executive session, and after the bids
had all been opened and tho represen
tatives of the bidding companies
heard, Councilman Haye, seconded
by Councilman Dubose, made a mo
tion that the council should purchase
at once what was thought to bo the
best equipment, tho American-La-France
auto pumping engine, at the
price of $9,000.
The vote upon tho motion resulted
as follows: Ayes. Councllmen Hayes
Linn and DuBose; nays, Councllmen
Neal, Caneman, Lorensen, Cavett and
McKay.
In referring to this matter this
morning Councilman Hayes said, "I
favored the immediate purchnse of
the auto engine because I realized
that delays were dangerous that de
that delays are dangerous that d
delays in the matter of the provision
of an adequate protection against fire
are doubly dangerous. The people of
1 !i m i-ti .
um cuy oi cnicKasna, by a 75 percent
majority, said that we stood In need
of modern Tire fighting equipment;
that vote authorized the city council
i ...i u, inuenienness of J10.000 for
the purpose of purchasing such equip
ment. The representatives of every
company submitting bids Rtated that
it would require 90 dvS from the
date of receiving the order until the
machinery could be delivered. That
means just -what It says -It means
that from the day upon which the or
der shall be placed until the day upon
which the auto-engtne shall have been
received In Chickasha the citv will
have to wait 90 days for the -,afe-guard
against fire which the voters
authorized the council to buy.
"I cannot soe what is to be gained
through this delay. Almost a half a
month has jiow passed since the pur
chase of the motor equipment -ras au
thorized and, as I see it, we are no
nearer having our equipment here
than we were on the night after the
election. And. further, as the matter
now stands no action will be taken
until the next meeting of the council.
Should the purchase be made at that
meeting-, with no further delay, over
threo weeks will have passed from
the date of the election until the date
of the placing of tho order, This
length of time will necessarily have
to be added to the time required by
the company to deliver the anto-en-giuo
and will mean that the city will
remain for that length of additional
time unprotected by modern equip
ment from the devastations of any
tire which might come.
"It seems plain to me that even
Chickasha could be burned to the
ground in three weeks time.
"I am not making these statements
for the purpose of censuring anyone.
I am making these statements, how
ever, in order that those who are won
dering why the equipment has not al
ready been bought may know that an
earnost effort was made on the night
of the last meeting of the council to
make the buy. I was and am a mem
ber of the regular standing fire com
mittee and as a member of that com
mittee I visited EI Reno and witness
ed a test of the engine which I favor
