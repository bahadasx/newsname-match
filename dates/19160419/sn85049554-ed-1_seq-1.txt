Wilson today told congress assembled
lit joint session at 1 o'clock this after
noon that be had given Germany irre
vocable notification tbat the United
States will bveak off diplomatic rela
tors If her Illegal submarine campaign
is "continued.

the B«rUn foreign offlce ae tbe preel-
W»s apeakiwr. ,,
Tbepresident asked no action what
ever of congress. He islmply Informed
congress of the accumulation .of facts
assuring that Germany's promises to
the United States are being violated,
that the submarine campaign Is being
conducted with renewed vigor in con
travention of all the laws of na
tions and humanity, that he means to
sever' relations unless it is brought
within the law.
New Up to Germany.
Diplomatic history of the world
shows that such, a course Is almost cer
tain to be followed by war. This marks
the end of diplomatic exchanges. A
^continuance of longstanding friendly
r1relations depends'alone on Germany's
conduct.
"I have deemed It my duty, there
fore," the president told congress to
day, "to say to the imperial German
government that If it Is still its purpose
to prosecute relentless and indiscrimi
nate warfare the government of the
United States la at least forced to the
conclusion that tlifere Is but one course
It can pursue, and that unless the Im
perial German government should now
Immediately declare and effect an
abandonment of its present methods of
'a .warfare against passenger and
freight-'carrying vessels, this govern
inent would have no choice but to sever
diplomatic relations altogether."
Considers It Ultimatum.
The president explained that the
note practically Is an ultimatum and
does not contain a time limit.
The preside^ revealed this fact to
Senators Stefire and Lodge and Repre
sentatives Elood and Cooper, thanking
democratic and republican members of
the congressional affairs committee, at
-r conference at the White House to
day.-.:--"
Th«fnote and the president's Idress
contain the' plain statement that the
alternative is the breaking off of
friendly relations.
The president went over the situa

of non-combatanta at aea could not

expoee them to such risks could

upon manifest and imperative prin
ciple of humanity and haa long

"Notwithatanding the earnest pro

hope that the danger involved, at
any rate the danger to neutral vea

The president lets It be Renown that
he Is not contending for America aione
but for all neutral nations and their
rights.
To Make Public "Notes.
The state department decided toilay
to give out the note to Germany as
soon as it could be copied. Officials
said it might be available about 4
o'clock.
When the president began the re
view of the German submarine cam
paign to demonstrate his recital of the
sacrifice of American lives every
head bowed forward as the president
indicated that he was approaching the
keynote of his message, the announce
ment of the .course he will pursue.
No Applause For Message.
When he declared that Germany
must immediately declare and effect
an abandonment of indiscriminate
submarine warfare or thirf government
would have no choice but to sever dip
lomatic relations, there was still no
demonstration, but intense silence.
When he concluded with the ex
pression of the hope that Germany
would so act as to avert a regretable
ARRAIGNMENT OF GERMANY
was sent to the. bottom. But again
and again no warning haa been
given no escape even to the ship'a
boats allowed to thoee on board.
What this govsrnmsnt foresaw
must happen has happened. Trag
ed has followed tragedy on the
aes in such fashion with such at
tendant ciroumstancea aa make it
grossly evident that warfare of
such sort, if warfare,/it be, can
not be carried on without the most
pslpable destruction of the dictatee
alike of right and humanity. What
ever the-diaposition and iritentiona
of the imperial German govern
ment it haa manifestly proved im
possible for it to keep, such Meth
ods of attack upon the commerce
of ita enemies within the bounds
set by either the reason' or the
heart of mankind.
"In .February of the present year
the* imperial German government
informed thia government and the
other neutral governmenta of the
world that it had reason to believe
that the government of Great Brit
ain had armed all merchant ves
sels of British ownership and'had
givan them secret orders to attack
any submarines of the enemy they
might encounter, and that the im
perial German government felt jus
tified in the circumstancss of
treating all merchantmen of bel
ligerent ownership as auxiliary
ehips'of war.
"The law of nationa has long
recognized the right of merchant
men to carry arma for protection
and to use thsm to repel attaeke,
tho. to uee them in such circum
stancef at thair own risk but
the imperial German government
claimed the right to set these un
derstandings aaids under circum
stances which it deemed extraor
dinary. Even the terme.in which it
announced its purpose to further
relax the reetrainta it previously
hsd professed its willingness to put
upon its submarinea, oarried the
plain implication that veesels not
armed still would be exempt from
destruction without warning and
that personal safety would be ac
corded their paasengere and crews,
but even that limitation has, in
fact, constituted no check at all
upon the destruction of ships of
every sort.
"Again and again the imperial
German government has given this
govsrnmsnt its solemn assurances
that at least passenger ships would
not thus be dealt with and yet^it
has again and again psrmitted its
underssa commanders to disregard
thoee assurancea with snti^p- im
punity.
"Great liners like the Lusitania
and Arabic, and mere ferry boats
liks the Sussex hsve bafll attacked
without a moment's warning some
times had even been unaware that
they were in the preaenoe of an
armed vessel of the enemy, and
th»- lives of non-combatanta and
crew have been eacrificed whole
sals in a manner which the gov
ernment of the United^ Statee can
not but regard as wanton and
without the elighteet coloi- of justi
fication.
-No limit of any kind, .in faot,
lias bsen set to the indiscriminate
pursuit and destruction of rrter
chantmen of all kinde and no*
tionalitiee within the waters con
stantly increasing in area 'where
theee operatione have been carried
on, and the roll of Americans who
have loet theie lives on Ships thus
attacksd and destroyed has grown
month by month until tho1 toll
has mounted into hundreds.
'One of the lateet and most
shocking instancss of this method
of warfare waa that of the destruc

of the submarine crew might be
sought and entertained.
"Recent events make the conclu
aion inevitable that it is only one
incident of the spirit and method of
warfare w$iich the imperial Ger
man government has mistakenly
adopted.
"The government of the United
States hss been very patisnt. At
avery stage of this distressing ex
perience of tragedy after tragedy
in which ita own citizene were in
volved, it has sought to be re
StcainecL from any extreme course
of action or of orotest by a
thoughtful consideration of tho ex
traordinary-Blredmstanceeof thia
unprecedented vl^n1, and .actuated in
air that it aaid or did'by sentiment
of genuine friendship which the
people of the United States alwaya
have entertained and continue to
entertain toward the German na
tion.
"it has accepted the explanationa
and aasuranc^of the imperial Ger
man government as given in entire
aiheerity and good faitjti and has
hoped even against hope that it
wtibld prove1'possible for the Ger
man government so to control the
acta of its'commanders as ts con
form with the principies of human
ity.
"It has been willinj to wait until
th$ significance of the facts become
absolutely Unmistakable.
"That point has now unhappily
been reached. The facts are sus
ceptible of but one interpretation.
The imperial German government
has not been able to put any limit
or restraint upon its warfare
against either freight or passenger
ships. It has, therefore, become
painfully evident that the position
whictr*this government took at the
very outset ie inevitable, namely,
that the use of submarines for the
destruction of an enemy's com
merce is of a necessity, because of
the very character of the vessels
employed and the very method of
attack which their employment
involves, incompatible with the
principles of humanity, the long
established incontrovertible rights
of neutrals and the sacred im
munities of non-combatants.
"I have deemed it my duty,
therefore, to say to the imperial
German government, that if it is
still its purposs to practice indis
criminate warfare against vessels
of commerce notwithstanding the
impossibility of conducting that
which United States government
considers in violation of interna
tional law, the government of the
United States is at last forced to
the conclusion that there is but
one course it can pursue and that
unless the imperial German gov
ernment should not, deolare and
affect an abandonrdlrht of the pres
ent methods of warfare against'
passenger and freight carrying
vessels this govsrnmsnt can have
no choice but to sever diplomatic
relations with ths government of
the German empire altogether.
"This decision I have arrived at
with deepest regret the possibility
of. any action contemplated* am
sure, all thoughtful Americans will
look to with unaffected reluctance,
but we can not forget that we are
by the force of circumstances ths
responsible spokesmen of the
rights of humanity and we can not
remain silent when those rights
seem in the prospect of being ut
terly swspt away.
"Ws owe it to a due regard of
our righte as a nation, to our
senss of duty ae a representativa
of the rights of neutrals the'world
over, snd to a just conception of
the rights of mankind to take this
stand now with ths utmost sol
smnity snd firmnsss.
"I hsvs taken it, and am taking
it in confidence that it will meet
with your approval and support.
All sobsr-mindsd men must units
in hoping that the imperial Ger
man government, which hae, un
der other' olroumstanoee stood for
all thst we now contend for,: may
recognize the justics of our do*
monds snd meet them in the spirit
to' which they are mode."

Hugh Ia Scott, chief of staff of the
army, will go to San Antonio, Tex.,
tonight, by order of Secretary Baker
in order to get accurate Information
as to the situation on the border. The
secretary issued the following state
ment:
"General Scott leaves for San An
tonio this evening at my request.,- He
will spend several days with General
Funston and then return. This trip is
made solely for the purpose of getting
as accurate information as possible for
the department. General Funston re
mains in full charge of the expedition.
He has the full confidence of the de
partment and his dispositions have the
department's entire aipproval."
Secretary Baker would not discuss
General Scott's mission beyond his
formal stajtemenrt.
It was assumed, however, that his
report will go far toward determining
.the course to be pursued in Mexico.
It is known, however, that General

'The department apparently has hesi
tated to authorize any radical change
in the status of the expedition In the
face of request from General Carranza
that the troops be recalled, believing It
might tend to increase aniti-American
feeling aimong Carranza garrisons.
Until the German situation is fully
understood it is Impossible to forecast
the new move in the situation.
It is believed that General Funston's
decision to place additional troops at
General Pershing's disposal aroused
the department to determine on a
course to pursue with as little delay
as possible.

Major General Wood, former chief
at staff and now commander of the
eastern department, today conferred

It was said General Pershing had
withdrawn all outlying detachments
and that in the neighborhood of 3,000
men were encamped at San Antonio,
twelve miles west of 'CusI, and that a
force estimated at almost double this
number was being concentrated at

The belief that the American troops
are about to leave Mexico Is wide
