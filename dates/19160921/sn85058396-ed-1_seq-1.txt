OFFICII STORY
OF VILLA RAID
Bandit Qhief Captured Some
of Carranza's Artillery and
16 Loads of Arms and
and Ammunition.
Washington, Sept. 21. An official
account of Villa's raid on Chihuahua
City last Saturday received at the war
department today from Brigadier-General
Bell at El Paso, says the bandit
chief captured some of Carranza's ar
tillery and sixteen automobile loads of
arms and ammunition, liberated 200
prisoners from tho penitentiary and
made off, after being joined by from
1,000 to 1,500 soldiers of the Carranza
garrison.
According to General Bell's Informa
tion, Villa himself went to the. gov
ernor's palace and made a speech
from tho balcony after his- forces had
captured the palace, the penitentiary
and federal buildings.
The reports reveals the fact that on
Sept. 14 Villa sent a letter to Gen
oral Trevlno, commander at Chihua
hua, saying ho would be in the city
at 3 p. m.f Saturday, to "shake hands."
Raid Was Success.
General Boll expresses the opinion
that the raid was completely success
ful nnd that Villa accomplished oven
more than he said he would. Tre
vino'8 personal guard deserted him,
It appears, and In the confusion many
government soldiers were killed by
their own comrades.
General Boll's report follows:
"Evidence Increases to show that
Villa was completely successful in his
attack upon Chihuahua and accom
plished all and more than he said he
would do. There is diversity of opin
ion and statements as to the number
of men with which he entered Chi
huahua. Some reports state he only
had about 500 while others give him
1700 but all agree that he was able
to secure possession of the peniten
tlnry, the governor's palace and tho
federal buildings and hold them for
several hours and all this with a Car
ranza garrison at Chihuahua which
some place at not less than six thou
sand. He liberated over 200 prison
ers, secured and carried away more
than sixteen automobile loads, of
arms and ammunition under an escort
of deserting Carranza troops. He left
Chihuahua with from 1000 to 1500
more men than he entered with.
Villa Retires Leisurely.
"Villa retired leisurely and prac
tically without molestation. The fir
ing by Trevino's artillery occurred
after Villa troops had withdrawn.
"On September 14, Trevino received
a letter from Villa stating that he,
Villa, would be in Chihuahua to shake
hands with Trevino on tho 16th and
he hoped that he would have a suit
able reception for him, that he might
be hungry and would like to have
something to eat.
"On the 15th of September it was
reported that Villa personally entered
Chihuahua, was seen by many of his
friends there and reconnoitered the
city. Of course he was in disguise.
"On the night of the 15th, the VII
listas approached Chihuahua from a
camp which he had maintained for
two days within twenty-two miles of
that city. After Villa columns had
secured possession of the peniten
tiary, the governor's palace and fed
eral buildings, Villa himself went to
the governor's palace, into the maln
balcony, displayed his face,' and made
a short speech which in substance
was as follows:
Promises Mexicans Liberty.
'"Viva Mexico! You do not have
your liberty. I will give you your
liberty, for I am your brother. I am
going to return in a few days.'
"It appears that there had been a
banquet attended by most of Trevino's
officers and that about 2 o'clock this
banquet was finished and most ot
the officers of the Carranza garrison .
were asleep. As soon as Trevino
heard of the trouble he started toward j
the governor's palace but his personal
escort deserted him and wont over to .
Villa. i
"The party that attacked the federal j
building rode into the building on .
horseback and the guard there deserts j
ed" to them. It is reported that many ,
of the Carranza troops, who were (
killed, were killed by other Carranza (
troops, probably as a result of artil- (
lery firing from Santa Rosa hill."

WILL ARBITRATE
TRANSIT STRIKE
New York State Board Will
Enforce Law Hearings
to Begin.
New York, Sept. 21. Arbitration of
the city's transit strike now in Its
third week, will bo enforced by the
j state board of arbitration and media
tion, it was announced here today
by H. J. Regan, a member of tho
board. Hearings will be held begin
ning Monday and both sides will bo
directed to present testimony.
Asserting that tho strike Is "the
most menacing labor situation that
has ever threatened the peace and
prosperity" of the city's population,
Mr, Regan declared that if a general
sympathetic trado strike was called
tho safety and livelihood of "six or
seven millions of people in this corner
of the state" would be endangered.
Must Protect Public.
'It is time that the expression 'the
public bo damned' be changed to the
new slogan, 'the public be protected,' "
Mr. Regan added. "The time has
come to put an end to the bickerings
betwen the railroads and their em
ployes. The disputants appear to be
unable to make an end themselves,
therefore, the board intends to exer
vise its powers and to make an end
for them.
"I have already taken steps to bring
about the compulsory submission of
the points in dispute. From my in
vestigations so far, I have decided that
a settlement thorugh mutual conces
sions by the companies and men is
possible. I will urge that the com
panies take back their striking em
ployes and settle tho great point In
controversy by reducing the time of
operation of the socalled master and
servant contract from two years to
one year."

JUSTICE HUGHES I
FRIEND OF LABOR I
Republican Nominee Appeal
ing for Workingman's Vote
in Indiana Speeches.
TALKS ON TARIF
Must Have Republican Pro- H
tcction or Confusion and
Disaster Will Come to
Country.
La Fayette, Ind., Sept. 21. Charles
E. Hughes, addressing his second au
dience of the day in the open air here
today, outlined the policies for which iH
he stands and declared that he want-
ed to see in the United States "a 'H
great driving force of patriotic sent- iH
iment," which would furnish the mo
tive power for progress. jH
"I want American rights protected fl
throughout the world," Mr. Hughes
said. "I desire to see a great driving
force of patriotic sentiment which will
give us the motive power of progress,
We cannot have progress unless we
have that loyalty and love for our
country which will enable us to get up
steam to supply energy. jH
"And therefore that we may have j jH
that I say that American rights must !
be protected throughout the world ;
with respect to American lives, prop
erty and commerce, with respect to
all nations of the world."
The nominee reiterated his declara- j
tion that 3e pathway of surrender j
to force leadsonly to civil war and
the end;" that he stood firmly for
arbitration of industrial disputes.
Friend of Labor.
.n'JL am the frlend of labor," he said. '
I Who is not the friend of labor If
la man Isn't the friend of labor he
isn't the friend of America because
we are laborers in this country and
we have all got to go up or down
together."
Mr. Hughes went Into detail con- j
corning his tariff views. He quoted 1
Henry Clay in support of his declara- j
tion that the doctrine of a protective i IH
tariff was not a partisan doctrlno but ! IH
"a sound American doctrine." The '
protective tariff, he said, would have j
to be applied to enable America to '1
meet European competition after the .H
"If it is not," he said, "we will not
only have a repetition of unemploy- j
ment that we had just before the
European war but we will have agi
tatlon and confusion and disaster in ' lH
this country. I see unbounded trou- i
ble ahead In disappointment and
blighted prospects of labor, if this is
not done. I see only disturbance and
disaster unless we take this matter !
in hand in time. 1
"We are good natured in this cam- t jH
paign. You cannot separate me in i
friendship from any American citizen fiH
whether he is a Republican or a Dem
ocrat, I make no partisan appeal In
a bitter way. I make no Republican
appeal in a purely partisan spirit."
Defines True American.
Mr. Hughes defined a true Amer
lean as follows:
"The man who is a true American
is the one who rejoices in tho vie
torles of our Institutions in giving
opportunities in which everybody .
shall have a share, not a selected Jl
view but the diversion of prosperity jH
among the great mass of people In jH
this country.
"It is idle to say that we cannot go
ahead because there are abuses. We IH
can cut out the abuses and go ahead
at the same tlmo.
"When a party is In power the best
thing it can do for its own good is
to demonstrate that it holds the stan
dard of public administration above
the petty demands of partisanship," I'l
Hughes Speech Brief. lH
Mr. Hughes spoko only for twenty
minutes at the suggestion of the
throat specialist who accompanied

ky and showed the effects of con
stant speaking in the open air.

Mr. Hughes spoke from the rear plat
