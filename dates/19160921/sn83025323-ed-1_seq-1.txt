Making Malta
"Movie" City
film Company Turning Mvalta Citizens
Into Motion Picture "Stars"
Ever since the arrival here of tis
members of the Great West Film
company, Malta has been strictly a
moving picture center. The prin
cipal streets, the Great Northern ho
tel, Shadi's barn, the depot and in
fact all of the different points of
interest in the city have come in for
their share of space in the reels now
being taken.
Not only have the buildings got
their share but some of our staid
and respected citizens have turned
out to he "movie stars." Among
those who have been most promi
nent before the camera the past
wee~k were John Shady, Clarence
Brockway, Clayton Snyder, 'Shorty"
Gelse, Doc Young, Jonny Mayberry
and others whom you would not
think ever had a leaning towards
this- kind of life have entered into
the new work with heart and soul
a~nd no doubt will soon be seen all
over this great, old U,. S. A. a;; prin
cipal characters in the picture "The
Golden Goddess."
Manager William T1obin of the
dim company, says lhe has never' ii
all his experience been treated as
lie has here, as nothing was too
good for the company, and nothing
asked for has been refused. For
the filming of the scene showing thei
arrival of the school teacher, I he
D~odson-Little Rockies stage corne
itany kindly loaned one of their big
coaches sand sent a mhan and team
