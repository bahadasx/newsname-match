and Crashing Band Music Attract Great Throngs
STAGE WILL BE SET AGAIN TONIGHT
FOR REPETITION OF GREAT FETE
Fantastic Parade and Balmasqae Tomorrow Night Will Be
Grand Finale of Spectacle; Judges Busy Throughout
Day Awarding Points of Merit For Numerous Dis
plays; Fifty-Seven Firms in Contest
Harrisburg's progressive merchants
were hosts and innumerable thousands
of "oh-ing" and "ah-ing" people were
guests last evening at the greatest
"first nighter" a show-loving public
ever witnessed.
Gorgeously decorated and illumin
ated store windows in the commercial
districts formed the stage, the pave
ments from curb-line to window-sills,
the vast. auditorium, and the streets,
where hundreds and hundreds of au
tomobiles traveled and ranged them
selves in parks, was the foyer.
Telephonic chimes, disks of scores
of victrolas and phonographs, and the
crashing band on & stand in Market
Square, the honking of auto horns,
combined to form the biggest open-air
orchestra Harrisburg has ever heard.
Pretty Models Attract Throngs
Pretty models who promenaded the
J great windows in the latest Fall cre-
ations of seamstress and milliner, dem
onstrators in business or burlesque
costume—these were players.
Scores of street lamps and thou
sands of electric bulbs of many col
ors which light the signs of countless
signs, were the foot-lights.
Fire bells throughout the city start
led the early evening in the opening
chord that heralded the rise of the
curtain, and, with the sudden dark
ening of all tho lig;hts, the equally
suddenly flashing again into brilliancy,
the great curtain rose.
Briefly speaking these were the
high-lights of the opening of Harris
burg's three-day Fall Fashion show.
And hearty co-operation by the
Chamber of Commerce made it all
possible.
To grasp fully the details of the
wonderful setting one should have
been in Market street, Market Square
or other business sections of the cen
tral, east and west ends of the city
to appreciate the show.
At that it was only the first act.
Stage Again Set
To-night the stage settings will be
essentially the same and the finale is
to be staged to-morrow night with a
fantastic parade and bal masque on
Market Square. A concert by the
Municipal Band on the Square will be
a feature of to-night's program.
For hours after the curtain rose last
night the thousands of sightseers
strolled through the streets, stopped
at the windows, and stood and gaped
and gazed until eager neighbors more
or less audibly murmured the tip
about an all-evening seat in the big
theater.
To-day the judges were the busy
folks. George W. Fisher, the window
decorating expert of the Ellis Mills
Company. Reading, and 11. M. Schaar.
expert for Watt and Schand, Lancas
ter, and a former president of the
Lancaster Window Decorators' Asso
ciation, form the board of judges.

a long list of accidents which befell
him from the cradle until the time

ed before Judge Way in Desertion
