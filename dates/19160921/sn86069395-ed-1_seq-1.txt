Renewing his attack on the Admin

Tuesday night that passage of the
Adamson eight-hour law was a "sur

statement of Representative Adamson
that an emergency existed. He said
that tho measure related solely to an
increase in wages. He said:
"We have ati unjustifiable attempt
to use public sentiment with respect
to an eighMiour working day in or
der to justify a bill which does not
provide an eight-hour work day, but
relates solely to an increase in wages.
Wo have seen the choice of what
seemed to bo tho easier way, which
escaped the necessity of a determined
stand for principle. We have seen
what appoared to be the consideration
of immediate political expediency at
th expense of public -welfare."

Republican, and Judge Samuel Sea

indorsement for the cujcrnatora!
uomination was indicated by tho ear
ly returne from the State-wide prima
ries. The indications were that Whit

The Progressive vote aroused more
interest amoug State and national
leaders than any other feature of tho
primary, for it was regarded as giv
ing some light on how the strength of
the party would bo divided in the na
tional election. A majority of the
Progressive leaders of tho Stato sup
ported Whitman's candidacy. The
leaders of the socalled insurgent wing
who gave their aid to Judge Seabury,
professed to be more tlian satisfied
with tho result.

BLACKMAILERS
ARRAIGNED
Have Enough Evidence To
Convict Without Exposing
Wealthy Victims.
TWO MORE ARE ARRESTED
Members of Gang Confess Re
vealing Startling Details of
Big Society Swindlers.
Chicago, Sept. 20. While federal
authorities prepared to arraign for a
preliminary hearing, seven members
of an alleged blackmail gang who
used the Mann act as their chief
weapon, detectives fortified with in
formation obtained from two alleged
members of the gang who confessed,
made arrests in other cities and spread
a dragnet for H. C. Woodward,
sought as director-in-chief of the syn
dicate.
Hinton G. Clabaugh, of the United
States department of justice declared
he had secured sufficient evidence to
convict the gang without exposing
the names of their wealthy victims,
These victims, principally wealthy
men whose flirtations with pretty
women led them into traps from which
they escaped only on payment of
large sums, will be shielded from
publicity except as a last resort, it is
said.
The evidence secured in two cases
already generally known authorities
said together with a mass of.incrim
inating evidence found in the raid on
the apartment where the seven were
arrested will be presented tq the fed
eral commissioner.
TWO WERE ARRESTED.
Developments in the case reported
to' Clabaugh included the arrest in
New York of Frank Crocker, alleged
former member of the gang, who is
said to have confessed to a part in the
swindling of Mrs. Regina Klipper, of
Philadelphia, and the arrest at Phila
delphia of William Butler held there
in connection with an alleged black
mail pl.t against the late Mrs. Susan
G. S. Winpenny.
Clabaugh also revealed the source
of the information that led to the raid.
He said that "Dick" Barret and Ed
ward J. Thompson, two members of
the syndicate had confessed. They
probably will be given immunity,
Their revelations, said Clabaugh, were
replete with stories of shrewd black
mail, new and clever race track swin
dles and other ruses with which
members of the ganjr, beautiful wo
men and debonair, handsome men,
bled their victims.
BONDS TOTAL $100,000.
The bonds asked for the seven total
approximately $100,000. The men
refused to talk.
Mrs. Helen Evers, said by federal
authorities to have been used as the
"lure" in the bogus Mann act cases,
stamped her feet and said there is not
'a word of truth in the charges.
Mrs. Frances Chapman said nothing.
