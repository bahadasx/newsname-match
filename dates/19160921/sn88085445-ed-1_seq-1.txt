Vol. IX
PAY-UP WEEK WILL
PROVE HELP TO ALL
The first week In Octoher will
mark a general clean-up of debts
in the Lynden district at the same
time that a similar settlement Is
going on a 1 over the country, ac
cording to the plans of the loea
branch of the National Pay-Up VTtek
committee.
The movement was taken up in
Lynden on the recommendation of
hundreds of towns which took part
In the first Pay-Up Week, und
found it helpful in every way to all
members of the community.
"We all ar* dependent upon each
other," sad Frank Knapp, chair
man of the Lynden committee, to
day, in out Msg Pay-Up Week
plans. "No oue class can gain at
the expense of all the others. The
factories cannot run without mark
ets for their goods.
"The farmer can nmke no money
if there is none Lo buy liis surplus
products. As the farmer prospers,
all prosper. As the other commer
cial interests of the country prosper,
the farmer prospers. We must all
look to each other for our tvinf. If
we turn in.o the channels of busi
ness the millions of do lars .hat we
all owe each other so that we can
again use the do larg to buy more
things we need, every man who is
supplying a need wil' prosper.
"This is the object of National ,
Pay-Up Week, October 2d io Tin.
You can help and you can be help
ed if you wi 1 pay up during Hits
week. Every business man in l.yn
den has pledged himself to pay a I
of his bills that he can at this lUM. <
Let's al work together. Let's pats i
prosperity around
"Don't make any mistake in ..he
plan. The idea Istl't that you pay me
so 1 can pay the other fel ow, but
I'll pay you and you pay the other
fel ow. If we all take it upon our
selves to start the ba 1 rolfing, we
can have a real rousing pay-up week
right here. If we wait for the other'
fellow to pay up, it might not be
so much of a success as it should
be.
"The second National Pay-Up
Week, October 2d to Tth is to be
truly national in scope, as thousands
of communities in every section of
the United States from one coast
to the other and from the north |ne
to the Ou f of Mexico will take part |
in it. During this week, the ene - j
gy of mil ions of people wil; be cen
tered upon pas.-ing busy dol ars
around, cleaning up old debts, s'a't
lng In anew and prosperity wil
certaiHly result from it. Get reaity
for National Pay-Up Week, October
2d to 7th."

PICK JUDGES FOR

With the day of opening but two
weeks distant, interest in the ''ixth
Annual Whatcom County Fair is
quickening, and arrangements are
being made in all sections for a
splendid representation of coun y

■tow Whatcom County at its beat,
in contrast with the 1915 season in
which continued scorching suns
burned nn the fields.
The British Columbia Department
of Agriculture will contribute the
services this year of its experts to
act as judges at tbe Fair. Prof.
James Turner of Victoria will judge
the horses. Prof. McDonald, head
of the government ivestock depart
ment, the livestock, and. Prof. E.

ture looks on the fair as an educa
