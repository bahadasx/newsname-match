BE CHALLENGED,

LONG BRANCH N. J. Sept.
;15 President Wilson decided
today to take advantage of the
earliest possible opportunity to
challenge the statement tnade by
Charles 'E, Hughes in recent
speeches that the basis on which
the recently threatened railroad
MOUNTAIN GROVE R. F. D, No. 3.
strike was averted was merely
an increase of wage's for the
employes.
The president, his politisal
advisers said today considers
the principle of the eight-hour
day vitRlly affected by the strike
settlement HDd will s&ek to show
that while the railroad legisla
tion passed by congress to meet
thi .situation wili give thp era
plovos at least a temporary in
crease in pay the inort: import
ant point is that it established
the eight hour day as the basis
of work for railroud working
men.
The president. will make
known his views either in a
speech at Shndow Lawn or in a
letter. Democratic leaders ex
pect the Republicans to conti
nue their efforts to make the
strike set'lement an Issue, and
was said tiday that Mr Wilson
will welcome such an argument.
Mr. Wilson expects to make
clear that he will not be satisfied
until congress enacts into law
the rest of the raiiroak legisla
tion he recommended when the
strike mas threatened, including
an increase in the interstate
commerce commission and a
measure for investigation of
controversies between railwnys
and their employes before
strikes or lockouts are called.
The president already has
begun the work of selecting the
board to investigate the opera
tion of the eight-hour day on
railroads, although tho new
arrangement will not o into
effect for several months. He
will seek it was said today, to
appoint a board which will have
the Cull confidence of the rail
ways, the employes and the
public,

Philosophy Of Masonry
We trast that where ever we
fail to give due honor to this
jmost Honorable Institution.
; Please bear with us and assign
the lack to our Ignorance, The
heudingv)f our Article opens an
immense field for the intelligent
character, and especially to the
Freemason to explore and one so
rich in materials, that it can nev
or be exhausted.' 2nd. The Phil
osopby of Freemasonry, Involves
the history of its origin. Inquiry
into the ideas that lie at its
base, on!investigation of its pecu
liar form, And a development
(of the Ideas, which are illustrat
ed by its ritualistic emblems,
myths and allegories, and which
speaks thru its sublime system
of symbols. Masonry existed
along time before Freemasonry
was adopted into Masonry.
And Freemasonry has now
arrived, at, an age and period, in
its life, when its prosperity, as
an order, demands a deeper
ensight of its cbaractor and
tpachings.
In this country, for nearly
half a century, Freemasons have
occupied themselves merely with
the outward and material forms
of the institution, Not knowing
la what ideas the system had its
birth, what truth were symbol
ized by the rites, what notions
were intended to be illustrated
by its symbols, they have not
been able to rise to a true appre
ciation of its sublime spirit and
profound 'significance. The su
perior intelligence and culture of
the present age require more
than this. The questioning spir
it of the times demands a reason
for this and for that; it cannot
rest in a dead form, an outward
sign.
Freemasons should acquaint
themselves with the philosophy
of Masonry, seek and find the
sense of its rites, study its syra
bols until they see them all a
glow with infinite and eternal
truths. "Symbols are the
speech of God." and through
them Eternity looks into Time,
and the Infinite holds commun
ion with the finite, the divine
with the human through them
the mysteriwus currents of life
from the overworld stream
into our human world of prosaic
reality, and light it up with a
living glory. There is tat
latent in Freemasonry which
make it txacily tho institution
most needed in. ibis age- But
to be an ttTective; agent in elevat
ing and advancing man toa more
perfect condition, the sense of
its mysteries uiusl be better
understoud by Frea aud Accept
ed Masons, its philosophy must
be ntudiid, and its graud and
ancient emblems and symbols
must be made to i-pean tbeir im
mortal meanings as of old In
other words, Freemasonry must
ba idealized. Masonic liter
ature is exceedingly poor in
works touching upon this point-

As we understand Freemason
ry was adopted into Masonry by
our Lord and Christ. Please
read:
''But now in Christ JeBus ye
who sometimes were far off are
made nigh by the blood of
Christ.
For he U our peace, who hath
made both one, and bath broken
down the middle wall of partition
between us:
Having aholished in his flesh
the enmity, even the law of
commandments contained in
ordinance; for to make in him
self of twain one nev man. so
making peace;
And that be might reconcile
both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the
enmity thereby.
And came and preached peace
to you which were afa off .,nd
to them that were nigb,
For through him we both have
access by one -Spirit uuto the
Father.
Now therefore ye are no more
strangers and foreigners, but
fellow citizens with the saints,
and of the household of God;
And ' are built upon the
foundation of the apostles and
prophets Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner stone.
