Eight Thousand Cheer Candi
date's Speech in Milwaukee.
By WILLIAM HOSTER.
(Internatleasl News service.)
Milwaukee, Sept. 2)-Eight thousand
people tonight cheered for eight minutes
Charles E. Hughes' demand for the pro
tection of American commerce.
'We stand for the principle of sound
Americanism." he said. "We have no
secret purposes. We have no intrigues.
We have no covert understanding. We
stand for American rights with respect to
American lives, American property and
American commerce."
Accepting this as a renewed pledge from
Hughes of an intention to bring England
to account if elected to the Presidency,
the big audience in the Auditorium where
the day's tour of Wisconsin was brought
to an end. rose in their seats and gave
the candidate the heartiest cheer of the
day.
The pledge was a repetition of that
which, in varying form,. Hughes had
made in speeches from Sheboygan to Mil
waukee. With the pledge he had coupled
at Green Bay in the afternoon this as
sertion of Americanism
"We propose that we shall enforce
American rights on land and sea with re
spect to all nations throughout the world.
with respect to American life, American
property and American commerce.
"Nobody can embarrass me by talking
about Americanism. I am not for this
one or for that one. I am for the United
States first, last and all the time with
out regard to any other cnsideration."
