Dear Comrade— letter and ad- '
vertising received and have them up '
in all the public places, especially in !
the post office. I am very much
pleased with the posters and the way 1
you are handling the campaign. It 1
looks bright. '
The people are ready for the change
and I feel certain that we will carry
our precincts. I am distributing the '
Benson leaflets every week and I '
know that quite a number have '
changed their politics since reading c
the leaflets.
The unexpected may happen this
fall. We may have a perfect land
slide. This year reminds me of 1860.
No one expected to see Lincoln elect- j
ed but he was, with a good majority
and a good following of congressmen,
and it may happen this year again.
The old partyites are scared here (

complete alibi and charged him with
heading a "conspiracy." The chief of
pickets of the recent Machinists' strike
Edward D. Nolan ,was taken for veng
eance's sake, without evidence, and
they announce in the papers that they
"have the hemp stretched around the
necks of all." Isreal Weinberg, prom
inent in the Jitney Bus Operators'
Union, which is troubling the United
Railways, was jailed and accused of
murder. Warren K. Billings, past
president of the Shoe Workers, was
charged with the actual dynamiting,
and an eye-hitness who saw an alto
gether different man place the suppos
ed suit-case bomb, was assaulted in
the office of the prosecutor.
Five conspicuous enemies of the em
ployers were thus caught and appar
ently doomed. The warnings in ad

the mails, were thereafter ignored.
Direct evidence of eye-witnesses was
ignored. The Chamber of Commerce

Every newspaper blandly declined
to print a word without approval by
the "Law and Order Committee." Sev

case came secretly to us to whisper
that they knew the men were innocent

One detective working for the prosecu
cution told a member of the Interna
tional Workers' Defense League that
the men were to be convicted on fake
evidence, now being cooked up, but
"not to let on who told you." Only
by keeping the men from having any
defense could they be convicted, so the
prosecution had the indecency to try
to prevent any prominent lawyer from
taking the case. A judge forced upon
the principal defendant, fighting for
his life, a greenhorn lawyer of one
year's experience.
By making it clear to a prominent
criminal lawyer that the accused are
not guilty, we have gotten him thro

for a fee much lower than his usual

much money.

SPOKESMAN-REVIEW'H
WAR VOTE ENDS IN FIZZLE
The Spokesman-Review "straw"
ballot on "Universal Military Train
ing," which that enterprising organ of
capitalism has gone mad over, and
has boon carrying on for many weeks,
ended in a magnificent fizzle last
week. \
They published their "grand total"
of vote for the whole of the Inland
Empire, last Sunday morning. The
Spokesman Keviow covers a district
having a population of 260,000 to
,'IOO,OOO people, and their total vote
in favor of this proposition was 9,619.
To get this grand total, the Spokes
man-Review boasted in Ite headlines
that "ballots were received from 25
stales." If such is tho case, then it
would bo fair to say that they received
these !t,lili> votes oot of a population
of 50,000,000 people.
HUGHES ATTACKS
EIGHT-HOUR LAW
URGED BY WILSON
Says Failure to Arbitrate Rail
Crisis Surrender of Federal
Authority
Charles E, Hughes has found a
new issue for the Republican party
in the eight-hour law passed by con
gress for railroad employes. He de
nounced this law in a Hpeech because,
he charges, it is intended to raise
wages and not to reduce hours.
He gave enthusiastic praise to tho
principles of arbitration which he de
clared had been abdicated by the ad
ministration.
Can Not Surrender
"We can not afford to surrender
what we have won for our institutions
in this country," the nominee said.
"What have we won? We have won
the right to free discussion, a free
press, a democratic form of govern
ment, free assemblage, free legisla
tures and an executive chosen by the
people. We have left autocracy. We
have left tyranny. We have left force.
They shall not com^ back if we can
prevent it.
"We have recently seen what I re
gard as a very deplorable surrender
of that principle. I am for the arbi
tration of industrial disputes. That
is in the interests of labor. Labor
can not afford to surrender that prin
ciple.
Law Raise Wage
"We have recently had at the pro
posal of the executive an act passed
by congress, confessedly in ignorance
of the facts, confessedly in ignorance
of what justice demands. It is not an
eight-hour day law. It is a wage law
and nobody knew whether it was just
or not.
"Now, I am for justice in every
thing but I propose that in all we do
we shall investigate first and then
legislate. Our methods in this coun
try are of priceless importance to us
because they are methods which con
serve our peace.
"It is only one step from peaceful
settlement of such disputes to the
denunciation of our courts and all the
machinery of peaceful settlement. It
is only another step to the abdication
of government itself."
EXPORTS OF BEEF TO
NATIONS NOW AT WAR
PERILS SUPPLY IN U. S.
The war is encroaching seriously
on the meat supply of this country,
according to figures by the National
City bank.
Nowithltanding the marked de
crease in the number of food animals
in the United States, exports of meat
have trebled since the war began and
of beef alone exports are greater by
tenfold.
The compilation shows that exports
of meat of all kinds, which amounted
to 445,000,000 pounds in 1914, the
year prior to the war, amounted to
KH, r),O00,000 in 1915 and 1,339,000,000
pounds in 1016.
The increase of 100 per cent in the
total meat exports during the first
year of the war and 200 per cent in
the second year is trifling when com
pared with the gain in beef exports
alone.
The quantity of fresh beef exported
jumped from 6,400,000 pounds in 1914
to 170,000,000 in 1915 and 231,000,000
in 1916.
There it is in a nutshell. We pro
duce so much that "our national bene
factors" have to send it abroad and
America almost starves. What fools
we are!

Can you sell some tickets for the

Getting Cold Feet
On Monday morning the
the other 21 prisoners were di.
with the exception of one, tl. -t of
Capt. Mitten, but the men refused to
leave until the Captain was released
and the authorities who had had all
they wanted, acquiesced and the Cap
tain sallied forth into the free air
(the only thing that is free).
The daily press had it that these
men begged to be released, but any
body at all familiar with the tactics
of the Industrial Workers of the
World knows that this is a barefaced
lie. Of course it would never do to
let "the people" know that the offi
cials had backed down, but when one
considers that these men went back
for Capt. Mitten and that one of the
prisoners had already been given a,
sentence of six months and others of
a lesser period it is indeed preposter
ous on the face of it.
McKae and Ramwell Charged
Sheriff Mcßae and Captain Ram
well have been charged with violating
the Federal laws, and it certainly
looks black for Mcßae unless the
judge interprets the law just as the
mill owners would have it interpret
ed. Mcßae has not been around town
for several days but some of his depu
ties still have blood in their eyes.
It must be kind of hard on these
fellows to have to admit that they
have been beaten and that those bold,
bad (?) I. W. W.s are once more free
to carry on their work of educating
the rest of their fellow slaves to their
true position in human society. Pub
lic sentiment is strong against the ac
tions of the Commercial Club, and the
little business men are already feeling
the effects of the boomerang that they
wielded last week.
ULONSKA TO ADDRESS
NAVY YARD WORKERS
At noon next Saturday, September
23rd, Carl Ulonska will address the
workers in the Bremerton navy yards
in an open air meeting and in the
evening will conduct a street meeting.
Comrade Sophus Bonnevie is in charge
of the Bremerton meetings and there
success is assured.
BRADDOCK WORKERS
SHOT IN BACK
In the "Braddoek massacre" in
Pittsburg, when workers of the Edgar
Thompson Steel Works were mowed
down by machine guns and rifles of
guards of the company, most of the
victims were shot in the back, accord
ing to Mrs. Samuel Semple, member
of the State Industrial Board, whose
report appears in the bulletin of the
Department of Labor and Industry.
From this Mrs. Semple judges that
the strikers could not possibly have
been shot at "after offering resist
ance," as it was claimed at the time.
Another statement made by Mrs.
Semple is that the crowd seemed to
show no hostility to the militia, evi
dently preferring the guardsmen to
the armed guards and hastily picked
up deputies on duty at the plant.

Millers, jobbers and dealers in all
commodities used in manufacture of
bread have been called to«the office
of the United States district attorney.
In inquiries concerning the proposed
advance in bread prices only bakers
have been heard. They ] have main
tained that the price of bread is de
termined by the cost of commodities
used. { !
"This country has, according to
government reports, about 600,000,
--000 bushels of wheat, which is just
about enough for consumption in our
own country," said Paul Schulze,
baker. "We carried a surplus of per
haps 100,000,000 bushels or more from
last year's big crop, which is being
sold to Europe.
"The price Europe is bidding for
this surplus is the price the American
consumer has to pay for the 600,000,
--000 bushels that are consumed at
home.
"At the rate wheat is going out,
unless it will be soon stopped there
will be a shortage in this country
and flour and wheat will be sold at
calamity prices.
"If the government would protect
the American consumer and put an
immediate embargo on the exporta
tion of wheat, so that we would know
that we have enough for our own peo
ple, the price would immediately drop,
and perhaps the baker would be in a
position to continue to sell bread
without advancing his prices."
"Twenty years ago a 25-pound sack
of standard flour was sold to the
housewife for 20 cents," said another
big bread maker. "Lard was retailed
at 9 cents to 10 cents a pound, sugar
sold at 5 cents and 6 cents a pound,
and bread in one-pound loaves was
selling at 5 cents.
"Today a 25-pound sack of stand
ard flour is sold to the housewife at
$1.15 a sack, lard is selling at 18 cents,
sugar at 8 cents, and bread in three
quarters of a pound loaves at 5 cents."
For years the Republican and Dem
ocratic administrations have been do-
ing something for "the people," but
still the same gang of plutocrats are
able to "do" "the people" out of the
wealth that labor has created. Com
mercialism compels these plutocrats
to send abroad that which the Ameri
can workers have produced and in the
meantime these same workers pay
double and treble the price that they
paid years ago for the same kind of
commodities.

DEMOCRATS NEED
BETTER WAYS TO,
BEAT SOCIALISM
Suggest Training Schools for
Anti-Socialist Speakers
in Oklahoma
OKLAHOMA CITY,—The meeting
of the Democratic state committee in
this city was overshadowed by the
scepter of Socialism, according to
■ Harlow's Weekly, a Democratic maga
zine published in Oklahoma City.
The Democrats have suddenly awak
ned to the fact that the Socialist
arty of Oklahoma can no longer be
ken lightly. It has become a politi
il power.
Must Train Democrats
tty.-Gen. Freeling suggested that
Democrats in the state should
speakers who would be able to

"ar, he said, the people of Okla
lad taken readily to Socialism,
! they had heard only Socialists

only about the attractive side

earn Something
to combat a deep and
>hilosophy with plati
rguments based upon
.. .ounded as deeply or as
j as those which it is attempt
to oppose," writes Harlow's Weekly
"If the Democratic party expects
to drive the Socialists out of the field
in Oklahoma by attacting them direct
it is entering an arena where only
skilled combatants can hope to main
tain themselves, and it had,best be
gin at once to increase the number of
careful students of science, philosophy
and economics, who will be able to
meet the Socialists on the ground they
have choosen. It is impossible to do it
with the type of oratory that has so
far prevailed in Democratic campaigns'
in Oklahoma.
Socialist Leader Astute
"In most states the Socialists move
ment has maintained solely its philo
sophic character, but in Oklahoma
under a leadership the most astute
which it has ever developed in Amer
ica, it has taken the deceptive gen
eral appearance of an ordinary politi
cal party.
"A few close observers have come to
some realization of the ability of Pat
rick S. Nagle. The state as a whole
has yet to learn the shrewdness, acute
ness, adroitness and everlasting per
sistence with which he has directed
the Socialists of Oklahoma until his
organization is far the most important
and dangerous in America, yet to un
derstand the almost autocratic control
which he exercises over it.
Socialists Have Advantage
"But even under his able leadership
the real purposes of his movement re
main the same; it looks to a complete
ly changed and reorganized society,
a government fundamentally recon
structed to fit that society, and the use
of the present forms of government
for its peaceful revolution.
"The contest, then, is between two
utterly alien conceptions of society,
politics and government. In this the
Socialist leaders have the decided ad
vantage; they know exactly what they
are about, while apparently neither
the Democratic nor the Republican
leaders have even begun to understand
the nature of the menace which con
fronts them."
