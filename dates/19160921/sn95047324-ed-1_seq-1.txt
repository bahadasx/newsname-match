Tamiam Trail Re-Routed
at the Fort Myers Meeting
The Tamiam Trail was re-rout-od
at yesterday's meeting of the
Central Florida Highway associa
tion at Fort Myers. The St.
Johns river route was endorsed
for the inland waterways in Flor
ida. A legislative program was a
dopted, and matters concerning
the Dixie Highway, federal aid on
roads, and a great many other
questions concerning the high
ways of the state were discussed.
The meeting, according to Sec
retary L. P. Dickie, who was one
of the' Tamp, ns in attendance,
was a live oin; and promises even
greater things for the next ses
sion, which will be at Orlando in
December. ' At that time the sug
gestion that meetings be held
semi-annually instead of quarterly
will be acted upon.
The change in' the Tamiam
Trail carries it along the coast in
stead Ibf inland to Arcadia, and
provides a route which will almost
certainly be a continuous hard
surfaced highway by the winter of
1917-18. With the exception of
the eleven miles in Hillsborough
county and the six in Manatee
county there is provision made or
roadway already built for every
mile of-the highway between Tam
pa and Miami. Bonds have been
voted and contracts let for the
work in various counties and the
Tamiam Trail is assured.
The route adopted at Fort My
ers is from Tampa to Riverviev,
Parrish, Bradentown, Sarasota,
Venice, Englewood, Charlotte
Harbor bridge, Punta Gorda, 01
ga, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs,
Estero, Marco and across to Mi
ami. , It eliminated the run by
way of Miakka to Arcadia, but
the change was not opposed as Ar
cadia is already provided with a
highway routing as it is on the
western loop through Florida of
tho Dixie Highway.
Lafayette Takes Step Forward
The recent issued official guide
of the Old Spanish Trail asso
ciation which showed two routes
in Florida, that coming down tho
'west coast and another going
down the east coast, was discuss
ed. The officials of the associa
tion that sanctioned the guide and
map were scored as the Old Span
ish Trail adopted only one route,
that running down the west coast.
The guide book not only showed
one to Jacksonville and the east
const, but gave it greater promi
nence. A number of members of . the
Central Florida Highway associv
tio'n were present from Lafayette
county and reported the calling
of a bond election for $600,000, to
be voted upon October 17. The
Lafayette county section of the
Dixie Highway is the only, link
in the highway in Florida for
which provision has not been
made. The progressiveness of the
Lafayette county people was com
mended and the hope expressed
lhat the bonds would carry.
Polk county members reported
that the Polk county commission
ers had been notified by the con
tractors that the Dixie Highway
links in Polk county would be
ready for travel by January 15.
Word was given that Jacksonville
is co-operating with Macon, Qa.,
in an effort to divert one branch
of the Dixie Highway to a direct
course between -Macon and Jack
sonville, Cutting out the proposed
entrance into the state it Live
Oak. The matter will be investi
gated by the Central Florida
Highway association.
Will Urge Important Legislation
Legislation which the association
went on record as favoring was
brought up in a report by. the
committee composed of F. W.
Perry of Fort Myers and W. G.
Brorein of Tampa. .The report,
unanimously adopted, follows:
"Providing for the regulation
of speed and dimming of lights on
vehicles approaching other ve
hicles traveling in opposite direc
tions on the public highways.
"Providing for the carrying of
lights on all vehicles traveling on
public highways for protection a
gainst accidents.
"Providing for single license
tax and tags on automobiles.
"Providing for the employment
of state convicts on the public
hiffhwavs to the fullest extent
such employment is practicable.
"Providing for the state aid in
the building of inter-county and
intra-state highways along the
lines of federal aid now available.
"Providing for the fixing of
standard of the quality of gaso
lene that may be sold in the state.
"Your committee further rec
ommends for the consideration of
the members of this association
and the public the advisability of
enacting a law requiring all ve
hicles commonly used on the high
ways to be of the standard gauge
in use in other states. "
Secretary Dickie was authoriz
ed to send a telegram in the name
of the association to the Atlantic
Deeper Waterways asociation
convention at Philadelphia, now
in progress, endorsing the St.
Johns river route as the proper
route for government develop
ment as a part of the intra-coastal
waterways system. It is favored
by the association over the route
on the east coast, utilizing the In
dian river, because the St. Johns
river is already, open to naviga
tion and no private right-of-way
need be obtained1, and because as
a link in the inland waterways it
would also serve the large cities
of Central Florida, such as San
ford. . ,
A resolution was adopted ex
tending the sympathy of the asso
ciation to L. A. Whitney of St.
Petersburg, one of the directors
whose wife died Monday.
The Fort Myers people tr-nd"
ed the visiting delegations a good
reception, and the meeting was an
enthusiastic one throughout. Re
port in Tampa Times, Sep. 14.
.'The following are the resolu
tions re-routing the Tamiam
Trail:
Whereas, there has been en
dorsed by this association a cross-
state highway,known as the Tami
am Trail, extending from Tampa
to Miami; and,
Whereas, it is the purpose of
this association to endorse rout
ings of such highways through
tV rritory' that is showing an
active interest, and to assist in
good roads movements; and, r
Whereas, the association has
recognized the great progress be
ing made by Manatee county cit
izens and specific arrangements
have been made for a thronh
highway from Sarasota to Punta
Gorda; therefore,
Be it resolved, that this asso
ciation endorse the routing of the
Tamiam Trail from Tampa to Mi
ami as heretofore designrted, ex
cept that in place of its being
routed from Sarasota through Ar
cadia to Punta Gorda , it be
routed from Sarasota" through

Monroe Doctrine a
American
By Professor WILLIAM I. HULL,
THE success of the Monroe doctrine has been duo to European com
plications at home and the fact that the British navy ha3 been mis
( tress of tho seas. . We cannot take the whole credit for its enforce-'
ment, perhaps not even the chief credit.
In spite of the precautions against old world pa vers the Monroe doi
trine has not worked both ways, FOR THE UNITED STATES IIASV
NOT REFRAINED FROM TAKING TERRITORY TO WIIICH'IT
HAD NO RIGHT. . ' .
The Monroe doctrine has been made the ubiquitous policeman oi this
hemisphere. Foreign governments, not coming in themselves, have! told
us to protect their interests and thoso of their investors. Our own cor
porations insist on being backed up by the government. We have tried
single handed to clean up Mexico, but it look3 liko a world task.
Two facts remain. Tho problem of the Monroo doctrine will con
tinue with greater and greater gravity until it is settled. Tho possibility
of its solution is in The Hague, which has already accomplished so much
toward the. settlement of international problems.
WITH SUCH AN AGREEMENT AMONG THE NATIONS' OF THE
WORLD THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WILL AGAIN COME INTO
THEIR OWN. . v t ,'-.
Texas Fever
is a Variable Quantity
"Cattle ticks are the greatest foes of South's Btockmen," was the key
note thought in speech of E. K. Mlddleton, Pocahontas, Mississippi, presi
dent of the Southern Cattlemen's Association, at the opening of their
fourth annual convention in Shreveport, Louisiana, on August 1C.
"Ignorance and the cattle ticks are the only known enemies, of the
live stock industry. With these two influences removed, the cattle prob
lem will be solved in the South."
Texas fever immunity is a variable quantity in cattle which have had
the disease. Government officials who have given close study to rais
ing cattle in tick-infested territory have proved that immunized cows
' do suffer from Texas fever which results in deaths.
The' following statements are re
printed from Farmers', Bulletin No,
147:
I "The common tick, margaropus
annulatus, infests the cattle through
out the greater part of , Florida,
While maturing, each tick abstracts
a definite amount of blood from an
animal, and to tbat degree injures it,
The quantity of blood abstracted is
many times the weight of the ticks
when grown, for these Represent only
that part of the solids and fluids of
the blood Which may be converted
Into the tissues of the tick, the re
maining solids and fluids being re
jected. Ticks Carry Texas Fever Germe.
'But the greatest disturbance cre
ated by the tiek seems to be, not in
the amount of blood abstracted, but
in tho fact hat it is the carrier of
the germ of Texas . fever which it
transmits to cattle. When cattle
that have never become accustomed
to ticks are infested they become
very sick and usually die. This may
occur anywhere, either within or
without the tick-infested region. As
time , passes the important fact that,
no cattle in the quarantined area of
the South are ever safe from the ef
fects of Texas fever, either in its
acute or chronic form, becomes more
and more impressed upon those who
bave to'' study ' the affected cattle."
In a milk yield experiment at An
thony Farms, Anthony, Florida, gov
ernment officials used 20 immunized
cows, keeping 18 of the number free
from ticks by spraying with arsenical
olution, while the other 10 cows were
permitted to become tick-lnfesttd.
"The teAiperatures of the tick-lh-fested
cattle were higher than the
checks and nearly always above nor
mal. "Cow 15, that became most heav
ily infested, was a large red brindle
cow. She seemed to resist the effects
of ( the ticks until toward the end of
the experiment, but finally failed rap
idly in giving milk and died within a
week after the close of the experi
ment. '
"Cow 20 was infested almost as
heavily as cow 15. Her milk failed
quite early In the experiment. She
Rice Brothers in Bank
Robbery on East Copst
Last Friday, four men in an au
to stopped in front of the Bank of
Homestead, 43 miles south of Mi
amv and two of them got out,
went into the bank, held up the
cashier and vice-president, robbed
the bank of $6,500.00 in cash, and
escaped in the auto. Sheriff
Dan Ilardie was immediately no
tified and he organized a posse
and gave pursuit.
Near Everglade water station
on the railroad, the posse found a
power boat loaded with supplies,

presented a dejected appearance for
some time but later recuperated and
held her weight to the end.
"Cows 13, 16, and 17 were Infested
about alike, but Nos. 13 and 17 suf
fered more from fever than No. 16.
They were red cows of mixed origin
and doubtful ancestry.
A Few Ticks' May Cause Fever.
"The sickness in the cattle was
not entirely due to the number of
licks, for cows that had fewer ticks
by far than cow 15 were sick much
earlier.
"The death of cow 16, due to ex
cessive tick-infestation, ' and various
recurrences of fever in the other an
imals, emphasizes the extreme haz
ard of cattle being continuously sub
jected to these losses by the tic..
Cow 15 was one of the best of the
tick-infested group, and represented
at least a 10 per cent loss from the
capital invested in tick-infested
- . . .u.
cows. , Furthermore, tne losses -
served in this experiment were sus
tained on rations sufficient to main
tain body weights. It is pron-
able that much of the spring louses
in cattle now laid to starvation, due
to lack of pasturage, is materially
aided by blood depletion due to ticks,
and. that repeated dippings would
save many cattle lost otherwise.
"Fever-producing parasites are pre
sent in the blood of cattle once in
fested by ticks, though they may be
so few in number that no symptoms
of the disease are apparent. The
danger from them lurks there, never
theless, for under certain conditions
the parasites may multiply bo rapid
ly as to cause Marked disease or
death, or they may be transferred by
ticks to uninfected animals. Thus
the tick constitutes a source of dan
ger, and should be exterminated."

posse concealed themselves in a
near-by shanty and waited, while
the remainder of the posse took
up a position about ,a hundred
yards distant. This was Satur
day midnight. , Pretty soon the
robbers were""heard approaching
and the sheriff with his three dep
uties went out to meet them.
The robbers happened to see the
officers first and opened fire on
them, killing Allen Henderson and

In Healthfullness Florida
Ranks High - Dry Facts
Florida has a population of
921,618.
,' Such is th? result of tho count
made by state authority in 1D15,
the report of which has recently
been published by the Department
of Agriculture. A8 compared with
the United States census of 1910,
it shows an increase of 169,000, or
22.5 per cent, the greatest growth
in any 5 year period in Florida's
history.
Leaving out of the count indi
viduals of other races and state
convists, amounting in all to about
two thousand, there were 559, 237
whites and 360885 negroes. Of
both races, 492,120 .were old e-
nough to vote, 428,052 were under
age. The 291,828 white males
outnumbered the 267,959 white fe
males by a majority of 23,869, and
there were 14,187 more males
than females among the negroes.
There is more of these dry,
but rather uninteresting facts to
be drawn from a study of this re
port, but the average reader shie3
died Sunday. The robbers then
fled; and those of the posse sta
tioned a hundred yards away
hearing the firing, rushed to the
rescue and started in pursuit of
the bandits.
The latter, however, eluded
their pursuers and, up to Monday
night, had not been captured.
Sheriff Ilardie, however, reported
on Monday that he thought he had
the robbers surrounded in a bay
ou near Jewfish. Meantime, a
dispatch in Tuesday's Tampa
Tribune says that the names of the
four robbers, who are now mur
derers, are: Frank Rice. Leland

The Rice brothers are well
know in Punta Gorda, where they
have lived, off and on, for a num
ber of years. Recently they have
been living at Okeechobee City
and other points about the big

Kid Lowe was mixed up in the
bank robbery at Stewart several

products can be produced cheap

at figures and shudders at percen
tages. However, the abstracts
given indicate that, in spite of
more or less economic, conditions,
Florida's growth for the last five
years has been at a rate never e
qualed in tho past .
Such then is the rather mixed
population whose physical welfare
is tho charge of the State Board of
Health. The expenditures of the
Board for 1915 averaged approx
imately 13 cents for every ..man,
woman and child, white and black
in the state.
There is at present no machin
ery by which the exact, or even
the approximate death rate of the
state can be determined, but bas
ing an estimate upon the reports
from those cities in which ,ac
curaje statistics are kept it is 15
for each 1,000 of the entire popu-.
lation, and according to races, it
is 13.1 for the whites and 18 for
the colored race. In the cities
with a population above 10,000, it
is 17.7-14, 6 for the whites and 23.
4 for the negroes.
Reports received from those
cities of Florida which have re
alized the importance of keeping
accurate accounts of health, mat
ters, show the relative fatality of
various diseases, and these results
may fairly be taken as represent
ing conditions in the entire state.
Tuberculosis claimed more vic
tims in 1915, than any other dis
ease". Bright 's Disease came next;
organic disease of the heart fol
lowed. Diarrhoea and enteritis
(under "2 years) cancer and other
malignant tumors, pneumonia,
pellagra, typhoid fever, influenza,
broncho-pneumonia, syphilis, ma
laria," i diphtheria, and croup,
whooping cough and measles fol
lowed in order as causes of death.
Not a death from small pox oc
cured in the state in 1915. Deaths
from violence, still births and
those following childbirth are. om
itted from this enumeration.
Florida's death rate, as nearly
as can be determined by present
methods in force in the state, var
ies but little from that of northern
.states where similar statistics are
available. It is lower than in
those states where the larger share
of the population is gathered in
the cities. It is lower than that
of North Carolina; somewb
higher than thoso of Virginia and
Kentucky.
The death rate from typhoid
fever, from pulmonary tubercu
losis and other forms of tubercu
losis, and from pneumonia is
markedly lower than in the states
named and in most of tho northern
states. It is higher from malaria
(excepting in North Carolina),
from influenza, from pellagra (ex
cepting in North Carolina) from
syphilis and Bright 's Disease.
These and other scores of facts
that might be deduced from the
published authentic reports, , aro
proofs of the high rank that Flor
ida holds among the states of the
Union for healthfulness. If has
a decided advantage over many of
them in the low rate of mortality
from typhoid fever, consumption
and pneumonia, in spite of tho
fact that hundreds of tuberculosis '
sufferers come to Florida annual
ly, hoping for benefit and relief,
and death in their adopted state
is the final result. State Board of

The campaign committee should
pay the traveling expenses of

to go on the stump for the party.
With his large personal populari
ty and following his ability to ad
dress great audiences of men in a
convincing and" eloquent manner,
Trammell would prove of great
value in the campaign. And hav
