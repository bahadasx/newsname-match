President. Incidently, if the occasion
should arise, and this is not likely so
long as the present occupant remains
in the White House, we will have
plenty of material for officers to train

The Tool of Teddy finds his cam
paign audiences a frigid substance fce
can't edge in. He is merely sharpen
ing the ax for his own political de
mise. Otto Stifel, the St. Louis brewer
who headed Missouri's g,. o. p. delega
tion to the Chicago convention, was
first lieutenant among Judge Lamm's
backers Stifel is the real type , of
republican reactionary standpatter.
He represents many "Interests," in
cluding those for which Cannon, Boss
Barnes, Smoot, Penrose and Murray
Crane stand for.
Does Hughes favcr universal, com
pulsory military sorvice? This is the
doctrine of Boosevelt with whom he
"Is Iff accord." Though denouncing
Amerloans of German birth, T. K.
would have his munnlkln adopt; the
German military system. , .
Mr. Hughes Is an echo of T. B., and
only a whisper echo at that.

souri elections. The Bepublican State
Headquarters is open but that is about
all that may be said for it. There is
an atmosphere of discouragement
even in the headquarters.
Labor Day speakers all over the
Union coupled the name of Hughes
with that of Senator Sherman of Il
linois, as enemies of the organized
workmen. ( Sherman made an un
warranted attack upon Samnel Qomp
ers, arid now after having flattened
the Illinois standpatter, the head of
the American Federation of Labor is
showing up the Bepublican candidate
for President. Mr. Hughes partici
pated in the Supreme Court decisions
in the Danbury Hatters and Arizona
anti-alien law cases, both distasteful
to laboring'men.
Mr. Hughes declined to make a
speech at the Labor Day 1 celebration
at Nashville, Tenn., because he was
not permitted to talk politics. Evi-
dently he has rehearsed himself only
in attacks npon the Wilson adminis
tration. In the light of President
Wilson's work in behalf of labor, the
Bepublican candidate could ' have
found little to say that would please
the working men, so he chose rather
to offend in another way by snubb
ing them.
Teddy's tirades are just a little more
pioturesque than Mr. Hughes', and
that's about all.

publican, Edison declares, I am for
Woodrow. Wilson."
If there are two Americans who
above all others have the fame of
making good in business and of diS'
covering the road to the highest eflT
ciency, they are Henry Ford and
Thomas VI. Edison. For maximum
efficiency in the chair of the nation's
chief magistracy, they declare for
Woodrow Wilson.
Edison admits as to Hughes, that
"his capacity for hindsight, as we
learn from his speeches, is highly de
veloped;" but for courage, sanity and
foresight, Edison finds that Wilson
holds the record, and, he adds, "1 do
not think It a logical or sensible thing
to change to an inexperienced and
untried man just for the sake of a
change."
As these men think, so the nation is
thinking. Woodrow Wilson's major
ity is getting bigger every day.
Illegal Traffic in Came.
Twenty-five persons handling game
In interstate commerce in violation of
the Lacey Act have received Jail sen
tences, and a number of others have
paid an aggregate of 912,500 In fines
during the last four years. The fines
range from 91 to (200, the latter be
lug the maximum prescribed under
the law. Some 700 cases in all have
been investigated and of these, 850
have been reported for prosecution
by the Bureau of Biological Survey of
the, department, which has charge of
the administration of this statute.
The number of birds illegally ship
ped, and on which prosecution were
Instituted, were 37,740 quail, 8,032
partridges (ruffed grouse,) and 8,252
ducks. . These figures represent,
however, only the shipments in which
the bureau was .able to get evidence
sufficient for prosecution. Venison
also figured largely in Illegal ship.
meute, as ppward. of 10,000 pounds of
this were shipped in violation of the
law.
The bureau also, has compiled in
formation which indicates that In ad
dition to the Bgares cited above, large
numbers of birds have been shipped
illegally under each conditions that
the representatives of the department
were not able to establish cases com
plete enough to warrant prosecution.
It is believed that at least 99,523 qnail
were illegally shipped, and of these,
55,054 were from the States of Mary
land, North Carolina, and Virginia.
The number of partridges (rugged
grouee) involved was 10,302, and of
ducks, 6,252. The number of ducks
shipped illegally, at first thought,
seems surprisingly small, because
shipments of wild ducks greatly ex
ceed those of any other wild game
bird. It happens, however, thatsome
of the States have not yet prohibited
export of wild ducks, while others
only recently have been able to make
their lawB effective in this particular.
Reliable records show, for example,
that at least 100,000 ducks were ex
ported annually from the Big Lake
district of Mississippi County, Ark.,
under a law permitting the export
of ducks from tha-t county. This law,
however, was declared unconstitu
tional by the Arkansas Supreme Court
on February 15, 1915, and this de
cision will bring this traffic within the
purview of the Lacey Act.
Gold Mining in Alaska.
Gold mining in the Willow Creek
district, Alaska, is the subject of a re
port by S. B. Capps, recently issued
by the United States Geological Sur
vey, Department of the Interior, as
Bulletin 642-F. The region has recent
ly been the scene of aotive prospect
ing, and plans are under way for mim
ing on several properties as the re
suit of the beginning of the construe
tion of the new Government railroad,
which will pass along the border of
this district.
For several years gold has been pro
duced from lode mines in this region,
and in 1915 the value of this product
amounted to nearly $250,000. The ob
servations made by the Government
geologist at several of the more de
veloped properties indicate that the
lodes persist to considerable depth
and that the ore from the deeper
levels win prooaDty ne tree milling;.
A Mother's Gratitude.
Many a Mother in Ironton Will Appreciate
the following.
Many a strong man and many a
healthy woman has much for which
to loans mother. The care taken
during their childhood brought them
past the danger point and made them
neauny men ana and women. Thous
ands of children are bothered with
incontinence of urine, and inability to
retain it is ofttimes called a habit. It
isi not always the children's fault-
in many cases the difficulty lies with
the Kidneys, ana can be readily right
ed. An Ironton mother tells how she
went about it,
Mrs. Anderson Bust, Ironton says:
"One of my children suffered from
weak kidneys and was caused much
annoyance by too frequent passages
of the kidney secretionf, especially at
night. I doctored the child and tried
a lot of remedies but with no benefit.
Finally Doan's Kidney Pills were
tried and they gave wonderful relief.
This medicine regulated the kidney
action and deserves endorsement."
