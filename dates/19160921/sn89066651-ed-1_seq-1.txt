SCHOOL NOTES.
BW. H. JOHNSON, Supetinler,.ler.I
Lottie Orton of the Curleton
district entered school Monday.
Lottie was one of our freshmen
students lust year mid made a
good record as a student in this
school. She is a sophomore this
term.
We have several cases of ab
sences, especially in the lower
grades, many of these due per
haps to cotton picking. Several
of these, no doubt, arc not pick
ing enough cotton to justify their
detention from school. I know
of some cases where the children
are not earning twenty cents a
cloy. Will it pay to keep children
awuy from school and miss the
chance for an education because
cotton is a good price? There
seems to be no good reason for
the children missing school Jor
cotton picking unless they have
a widowed mother who must
have their help in order to sup
port the family. Prom the stand
point of dollars and cents, to say
nothing of other values which
mean even more than this, a
day's schooling, on an average,
is worth ten dollars to the child.
Think this over and I believe you
will agree that in most cases it is
a mistake to let the children pick
cotton and miss school.
Friday was organization day
with the high school students.
The following organizations were
perfected:

Some Figures arid Facts
About Pemiscot's Paupers
Last week we published a short
comment on the Farmington
Hospital situation, in winch we
also published a letter from the
Hospital to the presiding judge
of the county court in which they
threatened to return our insane
wards unless payment for their
upkeep was forthcoming at once.
But it seems that some think
of the members of the board of
equalization, and others, stated
that .1 udge Henderson advocated
a 20 pur cent increase of the,'
valuation.
List Saturday we took oc
casion to look up the matter and
we must say that no such of
either statements above are on
the record and if such was
talked of it has no more pressure
than so much street talk.
In looking over the finances
we tind that 50 cents on the hun
dred dollars valuation is levied
for county revenue fund, and
that for the year 191'5 and l'JIG,
ending last June 30th, the
amount of the county revenue
collected was $38,357.33. Now,
this amount becomes a new prin
cipal and is as a basis called 100.
This is divided as follows: Pau
per fund, 15; Officers' fund,
35; Contingent fund, 15; Road
and Bridge fund, 15. and Jury
and Witness fund, 20.
Well now, what is 15 of the
total for the upkeep of the pau
pers of Pemiscot county?
$5,753.59 for the total upkeep
of the county's paupers (of which
the insane persons, it will be un
derstood, form a part.)
The Presiding Judge informs
us that at one session of the
county court they allowed the
sheriff the sum of about $1,600
lor one quarter's board for prisoner.-'
but this is the largest
amount ever allowed for this
iieriod for this purpose. We cut
the amount half in two and that
makes $900 for three months'
board bill of prisoners, or $3,(00
per year.

board and maintenance of its
paupers at the county farm
something around $1,300 per
year, to say nothing about the
doctor bill during the year.
There are numerous other ex
penses for the pauper fund to
meet.
But how can it be done?
The amount set aside for the
pauper fund was $5,753.59. It
lias cost for the same period the
sum of $3,000 plus $4,456.60 plus
$1 ,300 or a total of $9,356.66, and
this shows a shortage of $3,603.07
each year, and no money to pay it.
These figures are taken from
the record and a statement from
the proper county officers.
Judge Henderson over the
phone told the Herald and has
made the same statement twice,
that he did advocate that the
amount of the upkeep and the
revenue be summed up and an as
sessment be levied that would
pay the county out of debt in 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 years time. He is
right. This county can better
pay a little more tax and get out
of debt, and then the rate can be
decidedly reduced.
At present, we understand the
total of the different funds be
hind will make something around
fifty-five and sixty thousand dol
lars. Think of it! Pemiscot
county $60,000.00 in the hole in
uue uiiiciciiu luuua, mu pauper,
officers' and contingent funds,
with no money and haven't had
any for some time. Warrants in
these funds discounting at from
10 to 30 per cent.
We don't see any need for any
talk just now, but action is best.
Talk about if the assessment
was raised we would pay too
much in proportion into the state
treasury is bosh, Pemiscot coun
ty is a ward of the state. We paid
about $12,000 into the state treas
ury last year and received in re
turn something like $14,000. We
think we are making a pretty
good investment. We believe
our tax-payers' will more than
be glad to pay a little more tax
for a period of five years and
have some system in which the
money should be expended, and
get out of debt, than to drag
along as it is discounting coun
J ty warrants and paying intere
'on the protested warrants.

Brasher-Hayes.
Monday night at about 9 o'clock
quite a surprise was occasioned
in the marriage of 11. X. Brasher
and Mi.-s Nolle Hayes.
The young couple had gone to
the picture show and on the re
turn home they entered the home
of Justice of the Peace P. M.
Gwin, uncle of the bride, and
asked that he unite them in mat
rimony, which was done imme
diately, and after receiving con
gratulations from the new uncle
R. N. Brasher returned to his
work.
The bride is the youngest
daughter or the late K. L. Hayes,
and Mrs. Darxie B. Hayes, also
being a granddaughter of Dr.
Granville M. Hayes. She was
born in this city and has spent
her entire life among her child
hood friends. The bride is a
very accomplished and quite
beautiful young lady. For sev
eral months she has been one of
the valuable assistants in the
postotlice. She is a favorite
among her acquaintances, and to
know her is to love her,
The groom is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. I. H. Brasher of Kuttawa,
Ky., and has been in this city for
the past four years, first coming
here to work as soda dispenser
for Letter's Drug Store, and for
two or three seasons has been in
charge of Simpson' Soda Shop.
He is a genteel young man, al
ways pleasant and cheerful, and
his friends are numbered by his
acquaintances. He has a natural
ability that will make him a suc
cessful business man.
As to their many friends they
were a little surprised of the cere
mony, though the young people
had been intimate friends for
some time.
We understand the new couple
will make their home with the
bride's mother, Mrs. D. B.
Hayes.
Well, our good friend, "Butch,"
here's to you and your bride, and
let us join your many friends in
wishing for you and yours all
the good thao life can bring you.
May snpi'css be yours.

Target Range, Laredo, Tex..
Sept. 10. Some twelve miles
from Laredo, over the sand hills
and with the only "inhabitants"
that can be seen are the mesquite
and cactus, the 4th Mo. Regi
ment is stationed, leaving the
Maine camp Sunday. Owing to
the hot weather we took the cool
of the evening for hiking, arriv
ing at the range about 11 o'clock
that night. The boys are feeling
tine and they soon had their
camp ready.
This has been a bad week as it
has been raining here almost
everyday. When wading the mud
it makes one think of Missouri
mud more than any we have
seen. We will finish on the range
today and return to Laredo to
morrow. The boys are doing
good shooting.
Sergt. D. A. Duncan is lead
ing the 1st Battalion, and holds
the best score.
We will be as glad to leave here
for the main camp as some of the
boys would be if they were leav
ing for home. For miles after
leaving Laredo such a thing as a
house can't be seen.
Lieut. Hitchcock with Privates
Atwell.Byrd and Davis were left
at the camp for guard duty. Our
head cook, Henry L. Citus, took
sick Wednesday and was taken
to the post hospital this morn
ing. Chas. Key will be the main
one in the kitchen with the other
help selected from tho company.
The 1st New Hampshire Regi
ment was ordered home, while
the Jnd Missouri is relieving the
2nd Maine Regiment along the
border. The 4th Regiment is
only waiting for their time to
come for the border duty as they
haven't missed anything yet.
When put down to real service
the 4th can stand anything. Co.
"B" is first with all movements.
They stand big hikes, the num
ber falling out being very small.
Everything is quiet along this
part of the border.
