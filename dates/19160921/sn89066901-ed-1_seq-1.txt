To The Music Lovers :
Having completed my first
month as head of the Mansfield
Band, and knowing as I do that
the band is in a large measure
one of Mansfield's public instilu
tons, I believe that it would not
be amiss lo say a f.w words.
The Mansfield Hand, as it i4at
present constituted, is undoubt
edly one of the best organiza
tions in this section ot it le state.
But. like all other walks of life,
it from time to time needs the
infusion of new blood; or in a
more ready vernacular, it needs
new members. .The members
we have are all excellent per
formers; but not infrequently
there is recorded a loss in the
present membership, due mostly
ti) members leaving town. So it
is obvious that this constant le
crease cannot continue indetin
itely without the band eventual
ly becoming so small as to be
compelled to disband. And if
my gauge of public, sentiment is
right, this is exactly the oppos
ite to that which is desired.
It has been decided lo recruit
tile band up to its' maximum pos
sible strength this year, and all
men, both the young and the
grown ups, are cordially invited
to enroll as active members.
The 1 1 fen sooiihr (tosses a slight
knowledge of music. There are
also a few former members of
the band living in Mansfield and
vicinity who would he 'welcomed
with open arms.
The season of open air concerts
is Hearing an end. and this win
ter will be devoted almost wholly
to developing the best hand in
the history of Mansfield.' Those
enrolling may be assured of my
I hearty cooperation in tittingtheiii
as competent performers, Iet
nw c ,H i,ni. mtfrewt- h - en rot I'out
as an active member. Come up
to the hand hall any Monday or
Thursday night.
This is exclusive of the pro
posed hoys' bund.
Sincerely,
,1. B. Crouch,
Leader of Baud.
