Appreciation No. 5
From Pasadena
The following is the fifth appre

in by Pasadena people. It came in
the form of a postcard to W. W.
rasher, who has made it a point to
be courteous to visitors in Ashland.
The card reads: "Just a small re
membrance of your kindness to us
in Ashland. We have had a fine trip
and saw some beauty spots, but noth
ing so beautiful as Ashland. We are
homeward bound and are as far as
Lake Tahoe. They close here Sun

Livestock Sales This Week
Make Total of Over $50,000
John Hunt of Portland left last
night with eight double-deck cars of
lambs, numbering about 2,020. He
brought them in several days ago
from Hlatt Prairie and is taking
them on to Portland.
G. B. Mansfield arrived last night
with 70 head of mules and five head
of horses In three cars from Klam
ath Falls. Fifty-three Jiead of the
mules are two-year-olds from the
Sprat Wells ranch at Bly. They are
a fine lot of mules, one weighing
1,240 pounds and a good many be
ing 15 hands high. Mr. Mansfield
says it is the best lot of two-year-old
mules he has ever seen. The re
mainder of the mules and the horses
were picked up at Klamath Falls.
The entl'e shipment is headed for
the Mansfield brothers' 3,000-acre
wheat ranch at La Crosse, Wash.,
and will be loaded out tonight. A.
D. Barr, who used to be with Mans
field brothers but now lives in Ash
land, is c;oing north with Mr. Mans
field to assist in handling the stock,
but will return to Ashland. Mr.
One Man Wins
Twelve Families
Twelve families as residents of
Ashland largely if not entirely as
the result of one man's kindness and
assistance are pretty good evidence
of the value of courteous hospitality.
To the extension of the glad hand
and his interest in strangers W, W.
Ussher attributes the purchase of
seven homes In Ashland by outsiders
and the residence here of five more
families in rented houses. To all
who look for real value only In tang
ible assets here is food for thought.
If one man can add fifty persons,
more or less, to Ashland's population
merely by smiling and trying, others
can do the same. One hundred per
sons following this example effect
ually will nearly double the popula
tion, sell seven hundred homes and
rent five hundred houses.
1916 Crater Auto
Travel Beats 1915
Auto travel to Crater Lake, de
spite the shorter season due to heavy
snows, for this season exceeds that

the total number of tourists is rap
idly approaching the record total of
1,915, being only 24S shy on Septem
ber 15. The total travel to Septem
ber 15, 1915, was 10,545, the total
autos 2,076, while the figures for
the present year are. Travel, 10,1
297; autos, 2,346.
Select Seed Corn.
Better quality and yield of next
season's Oregon corn crop may be
furthered by careful selection of
home-grown, acclimated seed. Since
maturity is one of the vital factors,
the selection should be made now,
according to the Agricultural College
specialists, while It Is easy to dlsin-
gulsh' between the early and late.
maturing ears. These ears should
be well matured, of medium size,
well formed, with quite deep kernel
and good top and bud. They should
then be stored where there is no dan.
ger of frost or mold affecting their
vitality.
Mrs. Leta Vaupel Jackson, who

of one yard; three peaches, each
a "peach" in taste as well as looks,
were brought to the Tidings office
Thursday on a plate or, rather, brim
ming over the sides of a plate which
would barely hold them. The mon
sters were Globe peaches from the
orchard of T. J. Greer and were re
markable for their uniform coloring
and size. Xo, they are not on exhibi
tion, but perhaps someone could be
found around the office who would
tell you how good they tasted.

S
City Not to Blame
For Rasor's Spill
Earl Knsor's wagon overturned
I while he was navigating the bumpy
grades at .Nevada street some time
I back. He looked to the city for dam
lages. At TueedKv't; council meet City
Attorney Moore rendered his opinion
on the matter. He states that he
learns from the city engineer that
that portion of Nevada street where
the accident occurred has never been
opened up as a street by the city and
Is still private property, and hence
in his opinion the city was not to
blame for the accident to Rasor's
equipage. The report was accepted
I lWf Mnnro all P"'PRt pit hnwpVPf. that
the city open up the street and put
it In shape, and the matter was re
ferred to the street committee and
city engineer.
Liquor Branch
Gets Mayer In Bad
S. J. Mayer, proprietor of the
Mayer Incorporated Liquor House of
Hornbrook, Cal., will probably stay
in California, for a time at least.
The reason for this surmise lies in
the fact that In Portland a warrant
for Mr. Mayer's arrest Is lying in
waiting for him. This Is the first
warrant of its klud Issued in the
state.
The details of the case are as fol
lows: Mr. Mayer conducted a Port
land office for his California whole
sale house. One bookkeeper was
employed and is now under nrrest.
The district attorney of Multnomah
county discovered that orders and
payments for liquor were being ac
cepted by the Portland branch
through opening a letter addressed
to another man of the snme name as
his, by mistake. A plnin clothes man
went to the Mayer office, ordered
ltmior and gave his check, delivery
to be made through the regular le
gal channels. Accepting payment for
the liquor In the state lays the May
er employe and Mr. Mayer himself
open to a heavy fine.

Plan To Widen
Park Avenue
