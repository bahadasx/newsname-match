HAS E WART SOLD OUT J
Asheville, Sept. 19. The campaign
for congressional honors in the
''bloody" 10th, between Congressman
Britt and Zebulon Weaver, the Demo
cratic nominee is on in full force, the
canvass of the district having started
this week, when Monday afternoon
Weaver spoke at Marion and Monday
night at Sylva. Monday's speech was
the first one that Mr. Weaver has
made outside of Buncombe county, he
having opened his campa gn here, at
the courthouse about two weeks ago.
Mr. Britt has made two speeches be
sides the one at Sylva Monday night,
since he returned here several days
ago. Last week he spoke at George-
town and Ardcn, this county, at rallies
held for the county nominees.
Mr. Britt is accompanied on hu
present trip, which Fill take him
through Jackson and Transylvania
counties, by Judge -H. G, Ewart, of
Hendersonville.
Much interest is attached by local
Democrats to the - tr'p by Britt and
Ewart inTiew of the'fact -that last
June Judge Twart issued a statement
in which he said that he would ignore
the statewide primary, but would be
come an independent candidate for the
qtate lee'slature from -Henderson coun
ty, at thc November elect'on. Brown
low Jackosn, Britt's campaign mana
ger is the regular Republican nominee
for the legislature, this, is what caused
the speculation. among the Democrats.
It is not known here as to whether or
not Judge Ewart has changed his de-
c's on regarding the race for tne iegis7
lative seat from Henderson, but if h
has not, it will no douDt De an wwr
estine race, as the ' Democrats also ,
have, a 'strong candidate for the legs - ,

were State Superintendent or

den, State supervisor of rural schools;
E. E. Sams, supervisor of the -teach-,
ers' - training department and A. S. '
Brower, general statistician of the
State school "board. These men took -prominent
parts in the meeting, and ;
the decision to increase the work of
the ."moonlight,, schools in this sec-
tion is due to a suggestion mad-3 by
Mr. Joyner. The State superinten
dent, after praising the work .of the .
"moonrghi" schools in the west, de
clared that system - would make the
schools still more beneficial and sug
gested that each . superintendentTpIck
out six schools in his county, desig
nate them as "moonlight", schools, and
personally supervise the work of each.
He also suggestedr that each county
set -aside a month to be known as
"moonlight school month" and this
suggestion? also met with hearty ap-,
proval from the superintendent. ,
In endorsing Mr. Joyner's remarks, :
Chairman Sentelle declared that he -would
set aside a certain month for
"moonlight"schcol work, would des- .
ignate six schools as "moonlight- '
schools and would offer, six prizes,' "
ranging from $6 for the most success- "
ful school of-this character down to
$1 for the sixth successful. His. ex
ample., was immediately followed by. "
Superintendent W. H. Hipps, of Bun- .
