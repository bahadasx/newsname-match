MILLION DROWNED
IN CHINESE FLOOD
Horrors of Previous Flood of 1 909
Surpassed by the Record
of Last Month
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. Nearly a
million people nave been made home
less by une of the greatest floods on
record In that aectlon of China where
the American Red Cross already has
pent $600,000 (or flood protection
and where the $30,000,000 loan for
reclamation work which wan post
poned by the war was to have been
spent. Reports to the Slate depart
ment today from the American consul
at Nanking said the Hwai river hud
Inundated an area of about 7000
square miles In Anhul province. Ap
peals for aid have been sent out. All
the autumn crops were destroyed.
Tlie flood occurred In an alluviul
section where the north to south
punage of the Grand canal had
dammed a large lake and allowed
the Hwal river too little space to
carry off the excess water. Today's
delayed advices described several
weeks ago, but officials believe there
probably has been little improve
ment. The State department summed
up its dispatches in the following
manner:
In the flood of 1909 nearly 1,000,000
Uvea were lost. Soon afterward C. D.
Jameson,, an American engineer, was
sent to China to work out a reclama
tion system. In 1914, Col. Slebert, of
the Panama canal, headed a Hed
Cross commission which approved
Jameson's plans, and tho Chinese
government began arrangements for
a $30,000,000 loan to put them Into

He Unflinchingly Stands
For Enforcement of Rights
Either on Land or on Sea
(Hr Associated Press.)
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Sept. 21
Charles Evans Hughes in his speech
here again last night outlined his
attitude toward the protection of
American rights as follows:
'1 'propose that we shall protect
and enforce American rights on land
and sea. I propose that we shall
protect and enforce American rights
on land and sea without fear and
unflinchingly with respect to Ameri
can lives, American property ana
American commerce. We have no
unstated policies, no intrigues. We
stand four-squared to the world, rep
resenting the United States and its
Interests and its interests alone, first,
last and all the time."
Mr. Hughes' reference to American
rights was contained in a speech in
which he made reply, one;by one, to
what he termed Democratic claims
for having aided business, and out
lined the Republica program. In so
doing he dealt chiefly with subjects
discussed in President Wilson's
speech of acceptance.
The shipping bill was characterized
as "a menace, the sooner removed
the better." The t'nderwood tariff he
called a measure "that must be
undone if we are to have a sure
basis of prosperity in this country."
He reiterated (hat the anti-trust law
instead of being clarified by defini
tion had been mde "more uncertain."
"I must say," he declared, referring
to the Democratic party, "after hav
ing read several of their statutes
that . they are the most wonderful
phrase-makers on record."
The federal reserve act, the nomi
nee said, fur from being a Democratic
measure, pure and simple, was taken
In great part from material supplied I control.'
- ---
by a Republican committee and a
draft of a Republican bill.
"Whatever salvation from panic we
have had thus far is due to the
enlightened foresight of the Republi
can party," Mr. Hughes said, in con
nection with the extension of the Aid
rich act during the threatened finan
cial depression in the early days of
the European war.
The child labor law, Mr. Hughes
Baid, failed to protect hundreds of
thousands of children at work in
various states under Democratic ad
ministration.
"Call the roll of states," he said,
"and you will find that the states
where children are emancipated frc
too early labor are Republican states
and that the states where child labor
still exists are under Democratic

MILLIONS FOR RELIEF
TODAY AND A YEAR AGO
(Br Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. Ameri
cans' glfta to the sixty principal war
relief societies are estimated at
$28,896,277.36 by the new Year Book
of the Carnegie Endowment for In
ternational peace, being distributed
today.
Seven million dollars of this amount
want Into the $80,000,000 raised from
alt sources for the commission for
relief in Belgium In addition, the
Belgian relief fund raised $3,OS5,000.
other societies added $184,000, making
grand total for Belgium of $10,269,
000, or over one third of America's
total contributions.
Twelve organizations raised more
tbaa $2,000,000 for France specifically.
while $594,000 was raised for Eng
land; $12,000 for Russia, and $313,000
for Serbia. This, with the Belgian
total, makes a grand total for the
entente allies of $13,000,000, not In
eluding some $3,000,000 of American
hed Cross funds which were very
largely used in allied countries. The
German Red Cross received $2,270,000
from this country with three German
American relief bodies, bringing the
Willi OF
TRAflSIT STRIKE
entire central power contributions to
$3,750,000.
Contributions for dependent na
tionalities effected by the war's rav
ages total over $9,000,000. By far the
largest single fund of this sort Is the
American Jewitdi relief committee
with $4,000,000, to which should be
added aimost $900,000 more from the
central committee for the relief of
Jews, and $323,000 from the People's
relief committee for the Jewish war
sufferers.
The Poles have received $473,000
and the Syrians and Armenians $430,-000.
The American Red Cross has re
ceived from all sources $3,231,000, In
cluding $651,000 from Its New York
state board.
Smaller funds and unknown con
tributions probably would raise all of
the figures appreciably. The largest
personal contribution Is given as a
million dollars, while many people
ate reported to have set aside a per
centage of their Incomes. The total
gifts represent about one twentieth
of the $600,000,000 spent bore by the
allies atone on specific war munitions.

COAST DEFENCES
SUBJECT OF STUDY
(Br Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. A com
mission of five navy officers headed
by Rear Admiral Helm today began
studying the question whether addi
tional navy yards or stations are
needed on the Pacific coast and the
Atlantic south of Cape Hatteras.
Later they will consider the advisa
bility of establishing submarine and
aviation bases on the Pacific gulf
and Atlantlo coasts.
A most Important, not to say start
ling, development was made this
morning in the Rescue-Eula mine. It
was the opening up of a four foot
ledge of the best ore that has thus
far been found In the property. The
discovery was made 20 feet west of
the shaft on what Is known as the
1050 level, which is an intermediate
at the bottom of the winze run from
the 950 level between the No, 4 and
No. 5 raises and a short distance
from the face of the east drift. The
winze extends downward for 100 feet,
but is In reality only' 75 feet verti
cally from the 950 drift. At a point
83 feet down a raise was lifted from
the winze at right angles and the
ledge, which had flattened out, was
picked up, but did not show excep
tional values. The winze was con
tinued and the drift, rather a cross-
cut, was run at the 1050 point In a
westerly direction. This morning it
encountered four feet of ore, a con
siderable portion of which shows
sylvanite, with particles of electrum.
A seam about half an Inch In width
is almost pure petzite, a form of
double tellurlde that is almost pure
gold. This seam ia almost identical
to the one that was encountered on
the 1400 foot level of the Belmont,
800 feet west of the shaft, although
In the latter place the seam Is about
bIx feet wide, with the petzite so
scattered through It that the value
was cut down to 198 ounces In gold
with 20 ounces of .silver. At this
writing the assay of the Rescue-Eula
