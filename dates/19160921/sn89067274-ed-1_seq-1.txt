went to Sprngficld,
One of the largest crowds that ever
listened to a political speech in Mex
ico packed the Circuit Court room on
Monday night when Speaker Champ
Clark, State Auditor John P. Gordon
and Senator Robinson, of Arkansas,
spoke. Chairman William Vivion pre
sided oyer the meeting. In his open.
ing remarks he warned the Demo
crats of Audrain county against the
dangers of over-confidence and urg
ed all to do their full duty. Mr. Vi
vion introduced Speaker Clark, the
first speaker, as the "best loved in
dividual and the best speaker."
"I am glad to be home again," were
the opening words of the Speaker.
"This is one of the most stupendous
spectacles ever witnessed by man,
when 100,000,000 people choose their
chief officer and for the sixty-fifth
time a House of Representatives and
one third of our Congress.
"The President is the President of
us all, regardless of political beliefs,
In this election we Inust remember
that a Democratic House and Senate
is just as important as a Democratic
President.
"The American people will not buy
a pig in a poke in this election. The
four leading candidates of the two
great parties are all great men and
all have record achievement. Wilson
was Governor of New Jersey, is Presi
dent and I confidently believe, will be
President again. One good term de
serves another.
"The candidates are all great men
and to pick flaws in their personal
character is peanut politics and to
abuse them is preposterous."
In speaking of Hughes' campaign
issues, or rather or h's lack of thom,
Speaker Clark said: "In 1908 at
at Youngstown, Ohio, Hughes made
the greatest Republican speech I ever
heard. Those who heard that speech
and have heard his efforts since hit
nomination, have reached one of two
conclusions either that after his
service on the bench, where political
speeches were barred, his tongue and
pen have lost their cunning, or el'ie
that he has no real criticism and ro
concrete proposition."
. Speaker Clark asserted that under
the Democratic tariff, on which tha
Republicans have so many misfor
tunes in tho past, the American peo
ple are more prosperous than ever.
"It will never do at this time to swap
horses in the middle of the stream."
"The Republicans used to say that
the Democratic party was a party of
negation, now they accuse of doing too
much. There has been more reme
dial and constructive legislation in
the past three and one-half years
than in the past twenty years. Most
of the bills passed in the past three
and one-half years should have been
passed twenty years ago. We want
the Democrats to stay in until we get
all of our program spread on the stat
ute books and then if we prove to be
failures, kick us out and if our pro
gram proves good, keep us there."
Gordon Answers Lamm.
State Auditor Gordon was the next
speaker. Mr. Gordon gave it as hu
firm conviction that Wilson would
carry more states in 1916 than he did
in 1912. He then made answer to
charges made by Judge Lamm that the
State Treasury was "busted flatter
than a flitter." He stated that unde;-
the present State administration there
was several thousand dollars in ex
cess of $4,000,000 in the treasury
while under the Republican adminis
tration there was only a little over
$3,000,000. He then took each State
office and showed that more money
was collected and placed in the treas-
urv under Democratic officials than
under the Republican administration,
Sen. Robinson Speaks.
Senator Robinson, of Arkansas, fol
lowed Auditor Gordon on the plat
form. "The Democratic party has
by their Federal Roserve Act, made
money panics an impossibility in th:;
future. Without this law thero
would have been a panic at the open-
ine of the European war the like of
which the world has never seen be
fore. The best interests of the future
are bound up with the Democrats.
a recent speech Fairbanks said that
only the grace of God and Republican
party have saved this country from
ruin. I dislike this implication of an
allegiance between Providence and
the Republican party."

Tho managers of the varous offices

in Moberly Tuesday night After a

those who attended this meeting.
Marquess Wallace has gone to
Waynesboro, Va., where he has on

It is the people of the United States
who are on trial, not Woodrow Wil
son. No President in history has been
called up on to face such a succession
of tiemendous problems; no President
in history has ever faced problems
with more courage, vision and states
manship. His international policies have giv
en us peace with honor; his domestic
policies have given us prosperity and
justice.
Nt one of those who oppose nim
has dared to file a bill of particulars
against him; not one has had the man
hood to say boldly what he would not
have done that Woodrow Wilson has
done, or what he would have done
that Wilson has not done.
Only general attack, only blanket
criticism, only peevish fault-finding,
only base alliance with every foreign
country that is in controversy with
the United States.
Never were issues so plain; on one
hand a President who puts America
first, and on the other hand, those
who put party first.
Patriotism versus spoils; empty
promises versus splendid performance.
Democracy against Toryism, pro-
gress against reacton, honorable peace
against Financial Imperialism, even
handed justice agaist Special Privil
ege, prosperity against panics.
To reject Woodrom Wilson is to
reject the wise laws that have given
American industry and business such
amazing impetus.
To reject Woodrow Wilson is to re
ject the foreign policies that have
given us peace and honor and highest
standing.
To reject Woodrow Wilson is to
turn the United States over to chaos
between November 2, 1910, and
March, 8, 1917, for his repudiation in
volves the surrender of every Ameri
can contention with foreign nations.

New Corn and Hog Cholera
Hogs often take cholera Boon after
being put on a ration of new corn, and
its use is often condemned on this
account. New corn alone is not the
cause of hog cholera, but it may be a
factor, along with other conditions,
that helps weaken the vitality and ren
ders the animal less resistant to dis
ease. In order that new corn may be
fed with safety, the animals should
be put in a healthy, vigorous condition
before time to begin feeding.
When the animals are in a thrifty
growing condition, there should be
much less danger but the herd should
be gotten on full feed gradually. It
is well to give them about a stalk
of corn per hog the first day, grad
ually increasing it by one stalk a head
every other day so that it is getting
two (talks the third day, three stalks
the fifth day, and so on until they are
on full feed.
This gives the stomach time to ad
just itself to the new ration and is a
specially good thing to do before
turning old hogs into the field to hog
down corn. It is less necessary In
case of the shoats which are not so
likely to overfeed because they do
not have the weight and experience
which enable them to break down
the stalks rapidly. E. R. Spence,

Farmers Working Good Roads.
CHARLESTON, Mo Sept. 20.
The completion of the Hedgman's

Landing road is the only permanent
road in the county. It is expected
that Mississippi county's apportion
ment of the fund under the Govern
ment road law will be about $20,000,
and it is hoped to build a few
stretches of macadam road. Owing
to the recent dry spell having ren
dered the ground too hard to plow,
the farmers have put much work on
the roads.

Mexico Money Cheap.
Ernest Garrett is in receipt of 20
peso bill and 10-peso bill from his
son, Ernest Garrett, Jr., who is with
the regular army somewhere in Arizo
na. The peso is supposed to be a
Mexican silver dollar, worth about
50c of our money; but in looking into
the matter we find these SO-pesos of
paper money is worth about 80c.
Money of that character is plentiful
in Old Mexico, but won't buy anything
much. No country has any better
more solid, currency than the United
States of America.
We don't know whether Ernest is
going to send his son $30 of the Un
ited States money for the 30-pesos of
Mexican money or not The money
ought to be worth $30 as a curiosity,
and as you know, you can flash it
around and make it look like big mon
ey, if you want to.
When court opened Wednesday
morning, Battle McCardle filed an
other petition for a continuance of
the case on account of the news story
of Tuesday's proceeding published In
the Tuesday Evening issue of the
Ledger. The eontenton was based up
on the fact that tha story tended to
influence the jury in the case. The
motion was overruled by Judge Gantt.
At 9:45 Wednesday morning, Her
man Peltier, brother of Theodore C.
Peltzer, took the stand. He was sub
jected to a severe cross examination
by Mr. McCardle.
In the course of his testi
teetimony he denied that insurance
mony he denied that insurance
policies taken out by him in 1915,
before his brother's death were taken
out at the instigation of his brother.
He declared that they were taken out
by him, at his own volition. Ho later
1 stated that the premiums on insurance
carried by him were paid by the Theo
dore C. Peltzer Investment Co.
He was asked why these policies
were made payable to the Investment
Company, in which he held only one
share, rather than the Peltzer Estate
Company, in which he had one-fourth
interest, and replied that it was be
cause the premums were paid by tho
Investment Company.
At two o'clock in the afternoon Mc
Cardle completed his examination of
the witness. The examination was
then taken up by Frank P. Walsh for
the plaintiff.. Herman Peltzer stated
that he had signed back to the admin
istrators all of his share of the Peltlzer
estate. He stated that before talcing
out a policy in the Prudential shortly
before his brother's death, he had been
solicited for several months by How
ard Austin, agent for the company.
He described the scene in the office
of Maddox , which is in the same build
ing as hi brother's office was in, the
morning of his brother's death, in
which he was reproved by his brother
for his past actions and promised a
position in the Farmers' Trust Compa
ny, then in formation, if he would
promise to do better in the luture.
He further asserted that the relations
between he and his brother were al
ways frindly. He was excused from
iie stand at 2:30.
Clyde B. Morris, who was employed
in a building across from the Peltzer
office, at the time Theodore Peltzer
met his death, was the next witness.
Mr. Morris described the manner in
which Mr. Peltzer was seated in the
window and of his fall to the street
below.

cities, with a total population of about
67,000,000.
In 1914 the percentage of deaths
was 13.6, the lowest recorded up to
