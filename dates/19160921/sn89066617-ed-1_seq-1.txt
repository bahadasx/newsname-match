A NEWSPAPER THAT PRINTS ALL THE NEWS THAT'S PIT
THE CAPE COUNTY HERALD,
MAY EXAMINE
JOE J.. RUSSELL
UNDER AN X-RAY
4 Doctors Say He Has Ulcers
in Bowels May Go to
St. Louis Today.
CONGRESSMAN EXPECTS
TO BE WELL IN A WEEK
Tells Tribune Why President Wil
son Will Win-Is Sure
of Own Victory.
Congressman Joseph J. Russell may
be taken to St. Louis today for an
x-ray examination in diagnosing the
cause of illness from which he has
been suffering for several months, it
became known last night when he gave
an interview .to a reporter for The
Tribune.
1 He lay in bed at the home of Dr. R.
F. Wichterich as he talked and ex
pressed the hope that he will be in the
harness and ready for his campaign in
his district within mother week.
Congressman Russell, according to
the diagnosis of four physicians who
have examined him closely, is suffering
with bowel trouble. It is feared that
ulcers have formed in his bowels and
have been the cause of a swelling with
which he has suffered much pain.
Two months ago he was confined to
his bed at Washington while in the
midst of his legislative work in Con
gress. His Washington physician treat
ed him, and under the care of two
trained nurses, he was able to return
to his seat in the congressional halls.
He remained in the House till the
last day of the session and worked
each day. In the midst of his activity
on the final day of the session of Con
gress just closed, he suffered a re
lapse and was forced to be put under a
doctor's care again.
0n his way home after his second
recovery, he consulted with a physician
in St. Louis, who gave it as his opin
ion that the Congressman had bowel
trouble. Dr. Reed of Charleston, Mr.
Russell's family physician, expressed
the same view and after his arrival in
the Cape to visit at the home of Dr.
Wichterich, the latter also voiced the
same opinion.
A consultation was held last night
between Dr. Wichterich and Dr. Reed
to determine whether or not Mr. Rus
sell should go to St. Louis for an x-ray
examination.
As a result of the examination, it is
possible that an operation may be ;
deemed essential to restore the Con
gressman to good health. Mr. Russell
last night said he desired to be put on
his feet for a campaign and would con
sent to the operation at the close of
the campaign if at that time it should
be deemed necessary.
He declared that he personally ex
pected to go home today or tomor
row. Before coming up to the Cape
this week, Mr. Russell went to Sikes
ton where he had promised to deliver a
speech. He kept his engagement there
and last night he said he expects to be
in the Cape on October 17 to deliver
an address at the Democratic rally
that will be held here when William
J. Bryan will be the principal speaker.
Mr. Russell last night declared he
believes that President Wilson will be
re-elected.
"Mr. Hughes would be vastly more
popular with the' voters," he said, "if
he had continued to keep his mouth
shut. Every time he has opened his
mouth in this campaign, he has stuck
his foot into it, nad if he had stayed
at home he would have a chance for
election.
"I think there are four bills that the
President had passed which will have
a wonderful influence in bringing
about his re-election. These are in
addition to the fact that he has kept
this country out of the war."
Mr. Russell named the currency law,
the rural credits law, the good roads
bill and the eight-hour law as the
four bills that will re-elect the Presi
dent. "The currency law squelches panics;
the" rural credits law is the hand-maiden
of the currency law and gives the
farmer cheap money and on longer
terms, the good roads bill reaches the
farmer through the road improvement
and the eight-hour law averted a strike

Lilly Gets Letter From Secy, of
National Order Must Pay
to Drive Again.
Action of the judges of the race at
the Cape Fair in fining B. E. Lamport,
one of the drivers on the track, $100
for misconduct, has been upheld by
the officiate of the American Trotting
Association, and Lamport's right to
drive in races has been withheld, un
til payment of the fine.
The decision of the American Trot
ting Association 'officials was made
known in the Cane -yesterday when
Secretary Albert J. Lilly received a
letter from the secretary of the trot
ting association.
The letter declared that the driver
must pay the fine before he will have
the right to compete in a race on any
other race courses that are controlled
bv the rules of the association.
The man was fined on the last day
of the fair when he used language to
ward the judges unbecoming a driver
in tli? races. Friends of Lamport's in
terceded for him, but to no avail.
Lamport was a driver of a horse
named Lena Mako in the 2:15 trot.
One other situation remains to be
disposed of by the officials of the
American Trotting Association that
arose at the Cape Fair. A horse named
Graustark that was shipped to the fair
here from California was asked for
identification. The horse won two

races ano tnrougn a nusunnersiamunK
an appeal was taken to the officers of
the trotting asssociation.
Mayor Kage expects to hear from
the case within a short time.

lists for the last fortnight of August
contain the names of 603 officers killed,

missing.
During the fortnight Brigadier-General
Potter was wounded, Brigadier

that would have been a calamity worse
by far than the Civil War."
Mr. Russell declared that he has re
ceived many letters from his political
friends in the district, asserting that
he is stronger in this district than ever
before and he said that although this
district is considered dangerous, he
feels confident that he will win.
He said he expects to speak at tent
meetings at Charleston, Jackson, Por
tageville and Sikeston that already
have been arranged.

THE TRIBUNE COVERS
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI
LIKE THE DEW. i i
CONVERTED INTO
POLITICAL FIGHT
Lane, Democrat, Caruthers
Lock Horns Lane Tactics
Win Day.
SENATOR PROVES LEHR
NEVER WAS CHARGED
Obtains Postponement of Case
to October 3 Caruthers
Enlists T. D. Hines.
A battle of legal wits, flavored with
political significance last night was
staged before Mayor Kage when an
attempt was made to bring Dr. J. S.
Lehr to trial on a charge of practicing
as a veterinary surgeon without hav
ing a state license.
The political phase of the contest
lay in a fight between Prosecuting At
torney J. Henry Caruthers and Sen
ator Thomas F. Lane. Caruthers is a
candidate for re-election to the posi
tion on the Republican ticket and Lane
is the Democratic candidate for the of
fice. Lane represented Doctor Lehr r.nd
Caruthers, who has acted as attorney
for I.ehr in civil actions heretofore, lt d
in the prosecution. Caruthers was
joined in the prosecution by T. I.
Hines of Jackson, who had been taken
into the case to assist the prosecut
ing attorney.
As a result Lane's tactics, tiie
trial of the case was postponed till
October The case already has been
continued on several occasions.
Several days ago Caruthers tiled
three informations against Lehr in
which he sought to charge him with
violation of the law requiring him to
have a state license to practice veter
inary surgery. Such a violation of the
law would have been a misdemeanor
and subject to fine.
The date for trial was set last night
before Mayor Kag as Justice of the
Peace. The trial was to bo held in the
Common Pleas courtroom. Senator
Lane opened the legal battle by f'ling
a motion to quash the informations on
the grounds that under the law, his
client was not properly charged in the
informations.
He then took the floor and showed
that the law provides that a man may
perform certain acts of veterinary
work as a student and gratuitously
without having a license.
Caruthers and his assistant, Hines,
thereupon filed an amendment to the
information and desired to proceed
with the trial of the case. Lane de
clared his client was not ready to go
to trial and eventually obtained th
continuance when he filed an affidavit
saying S. A. Knott, one of Lehr's wit
nesses, was required for his case and
that he was not present.
