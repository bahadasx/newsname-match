IMPORTANT NOTICE TO
ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIBERS
During the past few months every newspaper in the
United States has been confronted with a most serious
question as a result of the rapid and constant advance in
everything that goes into the making of a newspaper. In
several instances papers have been forced to suspend
publication, in other cities consolidations were necessary
e and in the largest cities the subscription price was ad.
vanced, the size of paper reduced and all free papers dis
continued.
The Enterprise has delayed making any announce
ment regarding what we would be comoeled to do as we
had hoped that print paper and ink had reached the limit.
i This week comes another advance and therefore we will
ask that every subscriber of the Enterprise pay his sub
scription in advance. The pay in advance system was
t adopted when the Enterprise was started and hundreds
paid their first year in advance while a few did not.
d Practically every subscriber of the Enterprise owes for one
i. year. on the pay in advance policy and if payments are
made within the next ten days we can lay in a supply of
e paper to last for several months and therefore we will
not be compeled to advance the subscription price. If
e you pay your subrcription now in advance you are as
sured that when the advance in subscription comes that
you will not be effected. Print paper is costing us 150
per-cent more than it did a year ago and it is now neces
sary for us to prepare for the paper famine prices.
The subscription price is $1.50 a year. If you have
not paid your subscription since the Enterprise was started
you owe $3.00. If you paid for one year you owe $1.50
Please send your check or call at the Enterprise office
before you overlook it.

OPEN DAY AND NIGHT
Bogalusa Motorists To (Get
Service Not Excelled By
Sargest Cities
Bogalusa again comes in for being
one of the cities of the South that
is right up to the minute as a result
of the announcement of H. E. Res
ter, that his modern garage will be
open day and night and will not
close the year round. Furthermore
he will carry a complete line of
Ford parts so that no matter what
might happen to your car at any
hour he can have it in perfect con
dition in a few hours. He announces
that he will carry accessories for
all other cars.
Bogalusa car owners who have
had only slight troubles in other
nearby cities will appreciate this
more than anyone else, as on many
occasions it was hard to get even
the most common parts and no one
to put them on.
Mr. Rester now has six machin
ists, who are experts, and hereafter
all work turned out will be guaran
teed.

And Death Was Al
most Instantaneous

years, and who was employed in
the Messina Shoe Shop in North

Evidence introduced showed that
the negro had been shot in the
back with a bullet from a rifle. The
bullet entered just below the lower
rib, penetrated the heart and came
out about one inch from the left
nipple. The body was found about
200 feet from the cane patch where
the victim and two other boys are
reported to have been. The two
companions were unable to give
any further light on the matter.as
they were badly frightened. Officer
Smith was called in the case and
further investigation will be made.
