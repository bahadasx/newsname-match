Orphans' Day, September 30th. sc
M
Attention once more is call- cr
(d to the Orphanage Work Day th
hat has been announced for Septem- sc
)er 30 next. Appeals have gone out ^
rom the various institutions to Sunlay-school
superintendents and all m
>thers who are likely to be interested al
n the project. Emphasis might be ^
>iven to the fact that Sunday-school tc
md church people are not the only sc
- - . * n
)nes who could take part in sucn a "
leserving work. The destitute and ^
lelpless orphan should appeal to ev- h:
jry individual within our State. Con- w
;ributions may be sent to any insti- r(
;ution that one may prefer. It cer- iE
;ainly looks as if any person might T
ifford to give one day out of the 1E
rear as labor day for the orphan 1E
children and contribute the results w
)f the day, or the income of the day, **
;o their care and training,. It is to
3e hoped that thousands and thou- v<
jands of our people will cooperate in S(

Df the governor are justly proud, g
3ut of a total vote of 1,408, includ- f
ng the national guard vote, Gover- ^
iot Manning received 997. Edge- ^
ield county is the nearest competi;or
for the honor of giving Manning ^
;he largest percentage majority,
Summer coming next. Both Bamberg
ind Edgefield gave the governor a A
dightly larger percentage than Sum- A
;er. The unofficial vote, which was ?
irst published, gave Edgefield about B
1-5 of one per cent more votes for B
Manning than did Bamberg. The of- B
icial count reduced Edgefield's per- B
rentage slightly, putting Bamberg in c
:he lead. Bamberg's lead over Edge- q
ield, in percentage of the total vote q
?ast, is exactly .192, or about two- ?
:enths of one per cent. This gives ?
Dur county the distinction of being ?
:he banner Manning county in South ?
Carolina. This result was brought B
ibout by the hard and conscientious B
tvork of the Manning and Cooper B
eaders during the last three or four E
lays of the campaign, swinging prac- F

NOT TO PAY FOR SHORTAGE.
State Relieved of Accountability for
Missing Militia Arms.
. i
Columbia, September 13.?The issue
between the adjutant general's
office of this State ana the war department
concerning alleged shortages
of federal property furnished
for the use of the National Guard ot
South Carolina, which has been a live
and burning one for some years, expired
quietly today with the receipt
of a letter by Governor Manning from
Gen. A. L. Mills, chief of division bureau
of militia affairs,' stating that
according to a provision of the appropriation
bill for the fiscal year of
1917, the war department had been
authorized to relieve any State, territory
or the District of Coumbia
from further responsibility for such
shortgage. The section of the act
quoted in the letter of Gen. Mills follows:
"Provided that the secretary of
war is hereby authorized to relieve
any State, territory, or the District
of Columbia from further accountability
for all of the property of the
United States issued for the use of
the organized militia thereof, which
| the records of the war department
show have been lost or destroyed
prior to December 31, 1911."
Interment at Columbia. J
Columbia, September 18.?Preceded
by simple services of deep solemnity,
the body of Mrs. Anne Josephine
Howe, wife of the late George Howe,
D. D., and sister of President Wilson,
was laid to rest today at noon in the
church yard of the First Presbyterian
church of this city, beside the graves
of her father, mother, husband and
small daughter. The funeral was attended
by President Wilson, Mrs.
Wilson, Miss Margaret Wilson, Joseph
R. Wilson, from Baltimore; an- ^
nthor hrnthor TnVin A Wilcnn nf
Franklin, Kentucky; a cousin, Wilson
Howe, and Dr. George Howe, a
son, and Mrs. Annie Cothran, her
only daughter.
The arrival of the presidential party
in Columbia, the president's old
home, and the home of many of his
family, and his attendance on the
funeral at the old church with which
he and his family have been in various
ways-identified for many years,
was unmarked by any ostentation, #
and except for the curious, though
quiet and orderly, crowds that gathered
at the station, lined the streets
and surrounded the church, the funeral
might have been that' of a private
citizen, attended by private citizens.

Bandits Make Haul.
Laredo, Texas, Sept. 18.?Bandits
held up a passenger train September
12, near Tamosopo, rifled the express
car of $62,000 in gold, robbed
the passengers and then pushed the
train down the mountainside into a ^
deep canyon, according to apparently
reliable advices reaching here today.
The passengers were permitted to /
detrain, thus preventing loss of life,

which his chickens feed themselves,
thus saving him the trouble of early
rising and feeding them himself. As
the man remains in bed his chickens
walk around the contrivance in the
barnyard and inadverently step on
the end of a projecting board.
The weight of each chicken is sufficient
to tilt the board, so that the .
grain placed in the receptacle at the
top of the apparatus the evening before
is thrown to the ground. y
When the first chicken walked on \
the projecting board and discovered
that the faster it walked the faster
the grain fe^ll in front of it, other
chickens fell in line and it "wasn't
long before the whole barnyard flock
was marathoning around the contrivance,
eating up the grain as it fell
and working up appetites for the
next meal at the same time.?Popular

A Compliment for the Minister.

Mr. Hall, the new clergyman, received
a summons from an elderly
woman to call upon her when convenient.
"I do hope, sir, you will pardon
me for asking you to call," she said,
plaintively, gazing fixedly at the
young man pleasantly. "And how
long ago did your husband die, madam?"
"Oh, sir, he isn't dead," was the
reply; "he was took to the insane
asylum."?Washington Star.
