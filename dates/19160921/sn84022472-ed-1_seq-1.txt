was made public, by the state's attor

made for Mrs.. GHRgan to care of her

after Mrs. Lnych entered the home.
Some eight months later she died, the

most convenient to get at on a dark
night and was one of the most recent
ly interred, so evidences of poison
could be more readily detected.

critically ill and effect of publicity on
her was feared. ' '

day to refrain from declaring a gen

railway employes, of .whom it is as
serted there are 11,000 on strike.
This is the last day of grace given by
the labor' unions to th mayor and
volunteer mediators to settle the dis
pute with the Inferborough Rapid
Transit Co. and New York Railways

' If today's conferences fail to find a
plan of settlement, the labor leaders
threaten to issue a call tomorrow for
a general sympathetic strike to begin
on Monday. The citizens' committee
had little hope of success.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, is here
and has promised to attend a meet
ing with theeitizens' committee this
afternoon. , Local strike leaders also
will participate in the conference. Mr.
Gompers refrains from making any
public announcement of his views as
to the advisability of calling a general
strike. It was reported today that
some of the trade unions were opposed
to it,, owing to the fact that they have
contracts with their employers which
would be violated by a strike. '
Rioting continues 'nightly. Despite
the fact that 2,000 policemen are con
centrated in the center of the city last
night to protect elevated and cross
town surface lines, Strike sympathiz
ers bombarded cars with missiles. In
one case several hundred strikers at
tacked a car in Central Park West and

thizers on roof tons. Twenty-two such
attacks were reported by the police
within a few hours.- Car windows
were smashed under showers of bricks

Investigation of the fire at the Au

and his assistants believe that fumes
rising from gas and. oil in the boilr

It isn't expected that the Bridge

Organizers of the International
Union of Steam & Operating En
gineers, with headquarters in Chica

of organizing the 300 operatives Wre,
unionizing the Stratford avenue bridge
work now said to 'be done with non
union labor, and to oppose the Na
tional Association of Steam Engineers,
a branch of which has been formed
here.
In this city yesterday were F. A.
Fitzgerald of New Haven, state busi
ness agent and one of the three na
tional trustees of the International
Ur.ion of Steam & ' Operating En
gineers, and William MacKenzie, of
Portland, Ore., who is vice president
of the union organization.
MacKenzie formerly jnras a resident
of Bridgeport, haviirg begun his
working days in this city, and is a
brother of David H. MacKenzie of
Worth street. For many years he
lhas been identified with organized
labor and was honored with a vice
presidency at the last convention held
in Newark, N. J. - t '
Both organizers declare that or
dinances should be adopted by the
common council prohibiting work on
municipal contracts except under the
eigfoMiour scale. An effort to insti
tute such remedial legislation will be
made at an early date.- The organ
izers assert that while city employes
work on-.the eight-hour scale, contrac
tors doing work under city control are
permitted to -.. fade the requirements
because the administration falls to
protect Bridgeport labor by Inserting
the proper clauses in contracts When
signed. The Holbrook, Cabot & Rol
lins Co. and the Warren Brothers Co.
are cited as Instances of companies
that employ non-union'engineers.
"We will ..also begin a campaign
against the National Association of
Steam Engineers, " said State Organ
izer Fitzgerald ; yesterday. "The N.
A. S. E. is not associated with, the
American Federation of Labor. It is
conducted in the Interests of the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers
and primarily is for the purpose of
educating labor, which will be re
stricted to a uniform "price set by the
manufacturers. A preamble of the
constitution' prohibits members' from
striking for "better wages or condl
