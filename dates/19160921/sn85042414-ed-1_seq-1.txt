POTATO®
150 Cars Daily" is Estimate
for Next Wfcett—Grain
Continues Heavy.
An increasing"number of car ship
ments of potatoes are being made on
the Dakota. .division pf the Great
Northern, according to L. M. Davis,
chief dispatcher, today.
So urgent has- been the demand for
potato cars that officials are facing a
temporary car. shortage., though not
of serious proportions. Available
cars are being equally divided among
shippers as their need arises, and re
frigerator cars and small box cars,
the larger being needed for grain
shipments, are being utilized to rush
the spuds to market.
A considerable proportion of the
potato crop, much of it in heavy bear
ing localities,. yet remain to be
gathered. Though' daily shipments
are heavy, shipments will be greatly
Increased with the gathering of all
the crop, 'and at this time next week
it is stated the division will be handl
ing 150 cars of potatoes dally. Ship
ments made during the past week
aggregate some 250 cars.
An average of 110 cars of grain
are Ijeing shipped dally on the Da
kota division." Tlie Sarles line, which
is one of the heaviest shippers, is
handling from' 35 to 40 loaded cars
every day. Heavy shipments, it is
thought, will continue for some time,
though in the aggregate, grain ship
ments of the present season will faU
greatly below that of last year—th«
decrease being estimated at 80 per
cent.
As the season advances, an in
creasing number of cars will be
liberated to take care of all the de
mands upon this division, and the
present shortage 'will' be over within
a few days.

MANY MILLIONS
TOR WAR RELIEF
America's Gifts to 60 Socie
ties Amounted to $28,
306,277.36.
Washington, Sept. 21.—Americans'
gift to the sixty.principal war relief
societies are estimated at $28,896,
277.86 by the new year book of the
Carnegie Endowment for Internation
al Peace being distributed.
Seven million dollars of this
amount went. .Into. the. 180,000,000
raised from all sources for the com
mission of relief in Belgium. In ad
dition, the Belgian Kelief fund raised
$3,085,000, oth'er societies added
$184,000, making a grand total for
Belgium of $10,269,000 or over one
third of America's total contributions-
Twelve organisations raised more
than $2,000,000 for France specifical
ly, while $59'4,000 waB raised for Eng
land, $12,000-for Russia, and $313,000
for Serbia. This, with the Belgian
total, makes a grand total for the
Entente Allies of $13,000,000. not in
cluding some $3,000,000 of American
Red Cross funds which were very
largely used -in allied countries. The
German Red Cross received $2,750,000
from this ?oyptry, with three Ger
man-American relief'bodies bringing
the entire Central power contributions
to $3,750.009.
Contributions for dependent nation
alities effected, .hy. the war's ravages
total over '$9,000,000. By far. the
largest single fun(| of this sort- is the
American Jewish Relief committee
with $4,000,000, to which should be
added almost $900,000 more from the
Central committee for the relief of
the Jews and $323,000 from the peo
ple's relief committee for the Jewish
war sufferers:
The Poles have received. $473,000
and the Syrians and. Armenians $430,
000.
The American Red Cross has re
-eeived from'all sources $3.-231,000, in
cl.u.dlng $6ol,A00 from its New York
sta» board..
Small funds-and unknown contribu
tions probably would raise all of the
figures appreciably. The largest per
sonal contrllnition-Is-given-as a mil
lion dollars, while many people are re
ported to have set aside a percentage
of their Intfdme's'.' The-total gifts rep
resent about one-twentieth of the
$600,000,000 .spent .here. .by. .the Allies
alone on specific war munitions.
Secretary. Baker Declares
That Professional Soldier
is for Peace.
St. Louis, Sept. 21.—Secretary of
War Baker, in. an. address before the
Businessmen's league here yesterday,
said that as secretary of war he had
discovered that' the' arfy does not
TfT&Ylt WS.1".
"As a civilian," he said, "I be
lieved that a standing army was a
menace to free institutions and that
the professional soldier desired war.
But I want to make a confession to
you. I have found as secretary of
war that the entire army of the Unit
ed States, from the commanding gen
eral to the last enlisted private, does
not desire wan. .1 know of no body of
men who have a more singular devo
tion to duty than the army, and no
body of men who would be more will
ing to lay down their lives for their
country
"The army will respond, and wants
to be able to respond efficiently to
every demand made upon it. It is a
lover and conservator of peace and
efficiency.
"For three years, the greater part
of the American army has been on
the Mexican border. The army has
been put to the severest tests .ever put
upon soldiers. It has had a waiting
job. It is easy to be a soldier when
there is action difficult when there is
inaction. While we have heard crltli
cism and complaint from other
sources. I want, to .say that there has
never been a word of complaint rela
tive to condition or service from any
member of the regular army.
*'The militia was mobilised on, the
border, a distance of 1,800 miles—
twice the distance from St. Louis to
New York with great success and ef
ficiency. Notwithstanding the fact
that the men came fr6m all walks of
life, and are doing service In a Strange
climate, the efficiency, is such that the
sick report is less than two per cent
—one per. cent less than that of the
regular army.
"The time has come when there
must be power on the part of the
government to mobilise all the forces
of the country fojr the common de
fense."
COMPROMISE WITH
RAILROAD WORKERS
London, Sept 21.—The railway
crisis arising out of the demands of
the men for .an Increase of ten shill

demands^.
The war bonuses Accorded last
October ware live shillings a week
for adult employes and half a crown
for thoee under It. years of, age.
Thus. Instead or an all-round advance
of ten -shilling, adults get an actual

suicide by asphyxiation this morning
at-the W. J... Pierce -home, 415 North
Third street, where .she had been em

ed. the Pierce home and Mrs. Pierce
conducted an'.-investigation. The gas

Lilliquist' had -.been opened, and the
window and door were closed. When
questioned about the incident, the
young: woman, who appeared to be
sleeping.' wheh •. the discovery was
made by Mrs. 'Pierce, stated that she
had not turned the.gas on, unless she
had done so in her sleep. Nothing
more was- thought of the incident un
til shortly before 5 o'clock this morn
ing,' when Mr Pierce was awakened
by the odor of gas.
Fear that the girl had attempted
to' end her: life, ti-as Immediately en
tertained and MI'S. Pierce was called.
Miss Lilliquist's room was entered
and similar conditions to that of ttie
incident' last "evening were discovert d.

ing to the physician who was called,

pressed hier.. aesn-e: to return to her
native home bft claimed- that she
could^ never do as all of the money
which she earncti must be used to
buy. clothing and incidentals, and that
she could not save enough to make
the trip.
Mr. .and Mrs. Pierce speak highly
of the girl, claiming that she was
formerly employed' at the B. F.
Brockhoff home, and that she was
highly^ recommended. She was always
quiet. She spent the majority of her
evenings^ at home, .and .only had a
few girl friends.
Two aunts reside at Petersburg. N.
Di. and recently Miss Lilliquist spent
a two weeks' vacation as their guest.
County Coroner McLean was called
and is conducting an investigation. It

Relatives have been notified, but no
word had been received late this aft
ernoon pertaining to the disposal of
the body.
Members of the Pierce family are
suffering to some extent from the ef
fects of the gas, which had circulated
