at Lafayette, Ind.
Lafayette, Ind., Sept. 21.—•Charles E.
Hughes, addressing his second audience
of the day in the open air here, out
lined the policies for which he stands
He said he wanted to see in the United
States "a great driving force of patri
otic sentiment" which would give the
motive power for real progress.
"I want American rights protected
all over the world,* he said. "We can
not have progress unless we have that
loyalty and love for our country which
will enable us to get up steam to sup
ply energy."
All Are Laborers.
The nominee reiterated his statement
the "pathway of surrender to forco
leads only to civil war in the end," and
said he stood firmly for arbitration of
labor disputes.
'1 am the friend of labor," he said.
"Who is not the friend of labor? If a
man is not the friend of labor he is
not the friend of America because all
are laborers in this Country and we
have all got. to go up or down to
gether."
Mr. Hughes went into detail about
his tariff views. He quoted Henry
Clay In support of his declaration that
the doctrine-of a protective tariff was
not a ^partisan doctrine but "a sound
American doctrine." The protective tar
iff, he said, would have to be applied
to enable us to meet European compe
tition after the war.
Tariff Must protect.
"If it Is not." he said "we will not
only have a repetition of the period of
unemployment which we had before the
European war, but we will.have agita
tions and convulsion and disaster in
this country. I see unbounded trouble
ahead in this disappointment and
blighted prospects- of laborHf it is not"
,do&e: I see only disturbance and dis
aster unless we .jLakc* this in" .haridMn
time.'*
Mr. Hughes spoke only for twenty
minutes at the suggestion of the throat
specialist who accompanied himv The
nominee's voice was husky and shows
the effects of constant use in the air.
Before making his address he spoke
from the rear platform of his car to a
crowd at Monon. Ind. In this speech
he outlined his stand on the issues ot
the campaign.
The Hughes special left Lafayette at
11 this morning. The next stop was

WALL STREET FAVORS HUGHES.
Brokers Predict Record Breaking Wag
ers—Wilson's Backsra Not Shy.
New York, Sept. 21.—With the pri
mary elections in this stat£ out of the
way, Wall street today got down td the
business of betting on the cominp na
tional and state elections. If present
indications count for anything, this
year will witness the biggest betting
campaign ever seen in the. financial
district, where In past presidential
years (1,000,000 and more .has been at
stake on the election.
According to Edward McQuade, who
handles most of the big commissions
on the curb, there was a flood of money
offered on Hughes today at odds of 2
to 1, the amount being estimated in
excess of $50,000.
Wilson bettors were by no meanB
shy. McQuade reported that the pro
prietor of a big uptown hotel was
ready to place 910,00b on Wilson at
odds of 1 to 2, and that .he expected td
execute this commission tomorrow.^
Another curb broker bet $2,60O on
Wilson against $5,000. L. J. Stokes, an
other curb broker, announced that If
the odds against Wilson should length
en to 2% to 1 he waa authorised to
bet for one uptown interest $100,000 at
that price. Stokes doubted. that the
odds against the president would go
that high.
On the cotton exchange $5r000 waa
bet on Hughes against $2,600. Gener
ally speaking, Wilson's backers were
inclined to hold off in the hope that
Hughes' .followers in their enthusiasm
might offer better than 2 to 1.
Tempted by the fat betting commis
sions in sight many curb brokers who,
on account of the big business in
stocks, have disdained election bets
were today eagerly seeking business of
that description and many were pre
pared to Quote odds on or against the
respective candidates.
