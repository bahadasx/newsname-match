^IIRS. ALEX LEACH, OF NECHE,
GETS HIT BY'CAR AND DIES IN
SHORT TIME.
Bryant and Mrs. .Frank Holland, and
-driven by Mrs. Bryant, struck Mr*
Alex Leach, causing injuries from
which she died in a few hours. Mrs.
Leach, husband and daughter, was
Tisiting a doughter and sister, Mrs. A.
H. Weaver, and expected to leave in
the evening for Idaho, where tliey
•were to spend the winter, and during
the afternoon were shopping in the
city. They started to cross Fourth
street just as the Bryant car started
to turn from Arnold Ave to Fourth
street. The car was running slow and
Mrs. Bryant gave the signal with the
horn, and while the daughter, ju-'.om
paning her mother passed on out of
the way of the car, the elderly lady
seemed to be at a loss for a moment
to know what to do, and stopped fcr
moment, and the car struck her,
^d Jnflicting injuries which proved
fatal. She was rushed to the General
hospital and everything done which
could be done, but she soon passed
away without regaining conscious
ness.
Mrs. Bryant has been on the verge
-of collapse ever since the accident
and has the sympathy of the people in
"the unfortunate affair. Those who sa'.v
the accident attach no blame to any
one. It was a sad affair, and the
wife and mother, who only a few short
days ago laid aside her family duties
and strated out to spend a winter ot
•enjoyment, after many years of 'u«:a
labor, has ben returned to her home
and friends a corpse. The dc eased
~was 58 years old and leaves a husVand
in poor health, several sons and
-daughters, including Mrs. A. H. Wea
ver of this city to mourn her death.
The remains were shipped to Neche
for burial and Mr. and Mrs. Weaver
accompanied them there.

Howland, a newspaper reporter, wrote
the story of his proposed suicide, it
developed today and then carried out
his plans, except that he took poison
instead of shooting himself, as he had

Howland took poison at his desk in
a newspaper office here last night.
The story, closing with "30", was
found after his death. Howland had
grieved over the death of his wife

IES AND PROPERTY LOSS.
New York, Sept. 19.—The most ser
ious rioting since the transit strike in
this city began' two weeks ago occur

Manhattan, when attempts were made
to run cars on the®42nd and 59th St.,
cross-town surface lines.
Mobs of strikers and their sympa
thizers stormed two car-barns over
powering the police and putting vo
flight all railway employees in the vi
cinity.

Several motormen and conductors
who had not joined the strike werte
beaten.
Much property damage had been
done before the police arrived.
The police reported late tonight
that all surface cars had been ordered
to the barns for the rest of the night.
Final Appeal Tomorrow.
After a citizens' committee had
failed to effect a basis of settlement

employers today, it was announced
tonight tftat apparently the only hope
of averting a sympathetic walkout of
j700,000 workers, set for Friday now

Noonan, Sept. 18.—A most distress

Mr. Sillerud was ready to walk ov

would take his gun with him. After
procuring the gun and loading it, he
stopped to talk with Strandlien, who
has been working for him for the past
year an a half. It was while thus en

was discharged.
Immediately after the shooting the

GILBERTSON GETS
FINE MENTION
In the August number of the Fur
niture Dealer, published at Minne
apolis, Minn., we have read a most in
teresting letter written by J. P. Don-
has recently returned from a western
trip, and in this letter this is what he
has to say of E. W. Gilbertson, one of
our local furniture dealers and under
taker:
"The most elaborate and unique
show room I have seen in all my trav
el is that of Mr. E. W. Gilbertson's at
Devils Lake, North Dakota. The
room is handsomely hand painted, all
they are perfectly air tight making
the entire room one large show case
the carpet on the floor cost more than
one thousand dollars, the draperies
and curtains about three hundred dol
lars and the electric light fixtures are
gold plated.
"Besides carrying a reserve stock
about two hundred caskets in his ware
house, he has on display in his show
room about one hundred, and ranging
from his 'Indian' casket up to the best
metallic bronze, together with a large
display of ladies and gents suits, cas
ket linings and trimmings, and the
room being absolutely dust proof, ev
erything is uncovered and in plain
sight and neatly displayed."
Dwight, son of Mr. and Mrs. W. D.
Jones, left this week for Stanton, Va.,
to continue his school work in the col
lege at that place.
