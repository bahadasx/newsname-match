Sioux City Journal, 19: The fu
neral of John Davidson Wav, 21
years old, of Waterbury, Neb.,
whose death occurred Sunday in a
local hospital following an operation
for appendicitis, will be held today
at Springbank, Neb. Burial will be

was sent yesterday to Springbank.
Died, in South Sioux City, Neb.,
September 18, 1916, Mrs. Katie May
Nichols, 30 years old, of Laurel,
Neb., of peritonitis. Mrs. Nichols
was visiting relatives in South Sioux
City when she became ill. She is
survived by her husband and a
brother, Joseph Egger, both of

establishment to Laurel this morn
ing. Funeral services will be held
tomorrow.... For an hour last night
the abandoned trestle of the Bur
lington railroad in South Sioux City,
Neb., burned unchecked. It was 11
o'clock when the first flames were
observed. At midnight the South
Sioux City fire department reached
the structure. The Sioux City fire
department was notified that the
south end of the bridge was burn
ing, and several trucks answered.
When it was found that the fire was
in Nebraska the firemen turned
back to their stations. The old tres-

is composed of heavy timbers, and
the flames last night made slow pro
gress. Only a small section was
charred after an hour. There was a
large crowd of spectators, but no
person volunteered to assist in car
rying water to the burning struc
ture. The trestle is considered a
detriment to the beauty of the town,
Sioux City Journal, 17: William
L. Reilly. 28 years old. son of M. T.
Reilly, acting superintendent of the
Dakota county, Neb., poor farm,
who Thursday was shot in the left
leg by an inmate, John Payson, 68
years old, died late yesterday after
noon in St. Joseph's hospital, where
he was brought for treatment fol
lowing the episode. The charge was
fired from a shotgun and created an
ugly wound. It was three inches
above the knee, about four inches in
length and to the bone. The wound
bled profusely. Reilly was weaken
ed when placed in the hospital.
Physicians yesterday decided that
amputation would bo necessary to
save the young man's life. Not
enough strength remained for the
wound to heal and knit with the
lower portion of the limb. Death
came several hours after the opera
tion. Accounts of the Bhooting of
Reilly are conflicting. The inmate
is exonerated by some and blamed
by others. One version of the af
fair is that the men quarreled and
that Reilly was the aggressor and
threatened Payson, and that the
latter shot only in self defense.
Another story of the shooting is that
Payson stepped to the window of his
room and at a distance of ten feet
deliberately and apparently without
provocation, fired the charge into
Reilly's limb. Neither of these
stories have been confirmed, and
Sheriff George Cain, of Dakota City,
yesterday said that he had been un
able to find witnesses of the affair.
Soon after the shooting Deputy
Sheriff John Hileman arrested Pay-
son and he is in the county jail af.
Dakota Uity. lie probably .will be
tried for murder. Supt. Reilly was
not at the farm when the shooting
occurred, lie had lett his son in
charge.

cash bond. Bert Bostelle, of Jack

... .A plot to knock out or kill John
Hileman, deputy county sheriff of
Dakota county, Neb., was proposed
by C. D. Martin, of South Sioux
City, to Otto Rupp, another prisoner
in the jail charged with a statutory
offense against an 8-year-old girl,
according to Rupp's story to the Da
kota county authorities. Kupp says
he refused to participate in the plan,
which is alleged also to have involved
a robbery. Martin managed to es
cape by other means Sunday night.
He had previously escaped from the
Woodbury county jail here. Martin
is wanted in Sioux City on a grand
larceny charge growing out of the
theft of some bicycles. . . .George E.
McElheny, alias Elmer Williams, 29
years old, a carponter of South Sioux
City, and Charles E. Davis, 515 Per
ry street, were arrested by Detec
tives G. A. Danielson and James

larceny from the person in connec
tion with the robbery of E. Wash

Missouri river front near the foot of
Pearl street Sunday night, Wash
burn lost $240. Ho said he went to
the river bank to get a drink After
Washburn had positively identified
McElheny and Davis in the office of
Chief of Detectives Richard, Davis
confessed the robbery. He admit
ted he and McElheny had, gone
through the pockets of the "Nebras
kan. McElheny partly corroborated
the story of Davis. He confessed
that Davis had committed the rob
bery and said he himself hastened to
get out of the way when he saw a
crime was being perpetrated. Mc
Elheny's story caused Davis to smile.
The smile was contagious and spread
to the faces of the detectives who
were questioning McElheny. Mc
Elheney has been arrested before
and is well known to the police, offi
cers said. McElheney was arrested
at Fifth and Pearl streets. Davis
was nabbed later at Fifth and
Water streets.
