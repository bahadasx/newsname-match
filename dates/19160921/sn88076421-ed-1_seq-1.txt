The bride has made this city her

C. R. RUST, DULUTH WHOLE­
SALER DIED WEDNESDAY
J. C. Smallwood received a telegram
this morning from Henry Ketchum,
formerly local manager of the Stone
Ordean Wells house, stating that C.
R. Rust, the well known Duluth whole­
sale groceryman, had died suddenly
Wednesday night. Mr. Smallwood left
today to attend the funeral of his old
friend.
Mr. Rust was a millionaire. For 25
years he was manager of the Stone
Ordean-Wells Co. at Duluth and some
years ago organized the Rust, Parker
Co., wholesale grocers. He was an
uncle of Mr. Ketchum. He was ac­
knowledged to be one of the greatest
grocers of the Northwest.
COSTS LESS TO OPERATE
WARD COUNTY SCHOOLS
It cost the taxpayers of Ward coun­
ty $44,666.46 less to operate the coun­
ty schools during the school year end­
ing June 30, 1910, than it did during
the previous year, though there were
three more schools and more teachers
employed. It cost to operate those
schools during the year $307,594.21.
The number of ungraded schools was
reduced from 154 to 146, five of the
graded schools have been changed to
graded institutions. Nine new school
structures were built during the year,
making the total number in the county
189. The mileage of the county super­
intendent was reduced from $2,142.70
in 1915 to $1,240.41 in 1916.
THEFT CASE AGAINST
YOUNG FARMER DISMISSED
The case against Fred Oberg, a
young farmer from the southeastern
part of the county, who was charged
with grand larceny, was dismissed.
Oberg was charged with stealing a
buggy worth $125 from S. S. Boden, of
the Columbia Transfer Co. The
young man seemed much surprised
when arrested. He said he had bought
the buggy from a man who claimed to
be Boden, but who was not the owner
of it. He bought the buggy for $5.00
and tried to sell it for $10.00 after
keeping it in his shod two months.
Friends testified as to the good char­
acter of Oberg, who appears to have
been the victim of a sharper.
Claims He Owned 116 Newspapers.
E. D. Lum of Mayville, a well known
North Dakota newspaperman, gets
considerable publicity in a Minneapo­
lis paper by being credited with own­
ing and editing 116 newspaers during
his career. Lum has been shifting
around a good deal. The report did­
n't sa" whether or not Lum furnished
affidavits to prove his assertions.
Back to His First Love
H. L. Haskell, who was engaged in
the clothing business at Lakoti for a
year, is again employed at the Boston
store, where he started work in 1906.
"Shorty" is a first class salesman and
has many friends who welcome his re­
turn to the city.
Boston Store Buyer Returns
Harry Feldman and Herman Gor­
don, proprietors of the Boston store,
returned recently from Chicago and
other eastern cities where they select­
ed their fall and winter stocks. This
store has enjoyed a nice steady growth
and the present stock is better and
larger than ever.
DEATH OF DANIEL JOHNSON
Minot friends were shocked the first
of the week to hear of the death of
Daniel Johnson, which occurred at
his home near Norwich Wednesday
morning, Sept. 13. Mr. Johnson was
ill only a few days prior to his death
and even .on the day before he was in
Granville with a load of grain. On
reaching home that evening he suffer­

ed a stroke of paralysis and the end
came the next morning. Funeral ser­
vices were conducted from the Nor­
wich church last Thursday afternoon
with Rev. H. G. Markley in charge and
the remains laid to rest in the Nor­
wich cemetery.
Mr. Johnson was born in Leitshire,
England, July 18, 1845, being 71 years
1 month and 25 days of age at the
time of his death. Besides his wife, he
is survived by three daughters, Mrs.
O. Huddleson of Norwich, Mrs. J. C.
Hooker of York, and Mrs. C. C. Mar­
tin of Hamburg, N. D., all of whom
were present at the funeral. The be­
reaved widow and daughters have the
sympathy of all in their sorrow.
ELOPED WITH 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL
Joe Empey, aged 20, eloped from
Elgin, N. D., with fourteen-year-old
Angela Kary. The couple were ar­
rested at Mandan. Empey had forced
the girl to elope with him, threatening
to snoot her unless she did so. Empey
was employed by the girl's father. The
couple left at midnight in a hired auto,
going to Glen Ullin. Empey forced
the girl to walk with him to Kurtz,
two miles from that place, and the
couple spent the night in a box car,
catching a train the following morn­
ing.
NOONAN FARMER SHOT
BROTHER-IN-LAW IN LEG
Otto Sillerud, a Noonan farmer, ac­
cidentally shot his brother-in-law,
Otto Standlein, in the leg, which re­
sulted later in his death. The wound
was made with a shot gun. The in­
jured man was taken to Bowbells
where the leg was amputated but the
patient was so weak he could not
stand the ordeal. Sillerud was pre­
paring to hunt ducks when the acci­
dent occurred.
NORMAL FACULTY
Twenty Educators Will Start Train­
ing Work Sept. 26—New Precep­
tress at Dormitory.
The Normal school and Model
school will open Tuesday, September
26. All Normal school students should
report Tuesday morning at nine o'­
clock for general assembly in the As­
sembly room. All model school pupils
should report at the Model school
building, if classified in the first four
grades, for the sixth, seventh and
eighth grades, they should report at
the main building.
The dormitory reservations are
nearly all taken, but the information
committee in. the information office,
room 202, main building, will have
lists of rooms and accommodations to
assist students in getting located in
the city. A large and increased en­
rollment of students from out of town
seems likely from the interest mani­
fested in inquiries.
The same efficient staff of instruct­
ors will be at work this year, the only
change being the engagement of Miss
Ethel Detrick as Matron-preceptress
in place of Miss Cantwell, who has re­
signed to take up business interests in
the city. Miss Detrick is a graduate
of" Ohio state university and a special­
ist in Home Economics and Institu­
tional management. She has also had
experience in managing large com­
mons and dormitories at Miami uni­
versity, Oxford, Ohio.
Miss Bessie Johnson will be anoth­
er addition to our faculty, taking the
department" of Mathematics and Phys­
ical Sciences. Miss Johnson is a grad­
uate of the Universitv of Minnesota
ith the degree of B. Sc., and has
done post graduate work in science in
the University of Iowa. She comes
to us from the Science department of
the Bismarck high school, where she
was one of the most valued instruct­
ors on the staff. She will be a very
acceptable addition to our force and
will give us a specialist in these two
departments which have heretofore
been distributed among the other
members of the faculty.

ulty for this year:

LARGE RECEIPTS
During the first six days of Sep­
tember, the Equity Co-operative Ex­
change received at St. Paul twice as
many carloads of grain as they re­
ceived during the first six days of Sep­
tember a year ago, while the mem­
bers of the Minneapolis Chamber of
Commerce received only about half as
many cars of grain this year as they
did during the same period last year.
This will give a fair idea of the feel­
ing in the_ country toward the Equirv
Co-operative Exchange, and though
this ratio may not be kept up thru­
out the year it is safe to say that the
Equity Co-operative Exchange will
handle more grain this y6ar on the
short crop than they did last year on
a bumper crop.
AN ENDORSEMENT
The Equity Co-operative associa­
tion of Montana have endorsed the
Livestock Selling Agency, established
in South St. Paul, as the selling ag­
ency for all Equity members from the
state of Montana. This means that
the Equity Co-operative Exchange
will receive a large amount of live­
stock from the state of Montana alone.
The Montana boys always were good
co-operators, ana they are in favor of
endorsing only those institutions that
are owned and controlled by the farm­
ers themselves.
Mr. C. J. Lee, North Dakotas well
known banker and stockman, has been
,in St. Paul several days looking into
the livestock situation. Mr. Lee is
considering organizing a speculative

most important points in the various

ial work for six weeks at the Colum­
bia University and considers that his
vacation was not only very enjoyable
but of considerable benefit. This is
the first real vacation the president
has had in five years and both Mr.
and Mrs. Crane appear as tho the out­
ing agreed with them. Mr. Crane is
at Bismarck this week attending a
meeting of the Board of Regents.
Elks Will Install Up-to-Date Cafe
The Minot Elks are making ar­
rangements to install a first class cafe
at the Home, with a dairy lunch in
connection. TJie cafe will have a seat­
ing capacity of 125. There will be a
private banquet room which may be
used by societies and clubs for meet­
ings and social affairs. Other features
will be a permanent orchestra and the
introduction of novelties with the lat­
est music and song hits. Dancing will
be allowed during the evening. Ladies
may entertain at card parties and have
lunch served with the music and danc­
ing. This will be for the general pub­
lic, not for the Elks and their families
alone. The cafe will be leased to E. L.
Rowan, the custodian, which makes its
success assured.

Conditions are exceedingly prosper­
ous in this section of the state. The
bankers consider that the increase in
deposits is largely due to the increase
in diversified farming which has been
Very large thruout this section. The
wheat crop was very light, but there
is a wealth of cattle, hogs, horses and
other live stock in the northwest.
The comparative statement of de­
posits follows:

company to deal in stockers and feed­
ers on the South St. Paul Livestock
market. Mr. Lee has not decided ful­
ly as yet but should present dealers
on the South St. Paul market refuse
to buy cattle from the Equity Co-op­
erative Exchange, he will no doubt
complete the organization of a com­
pany and begin business on that mar­
ket shortly after the first of October.
Mr. Lee is well known over the north­
west on account of his substantial fi­
nancial connections and also on ac­
count of his untiring support of the
fight of the farmers for better mar­
keting conditions. Should Mr. Lee en­
gage in the stocker and feeder busi­
ness there is no question but what
the farmers would have an outlet for
every hoof of cattle shipped to this
market even though the so-called reg­
ular dealers should refuse to buy cat­
tle from them.
Mr. E. A. Bowman of Kulm, North
Dakota, was a pleasant visitor at the
St. Paul office this week. Mr. Bow
main was in St. Paul with two car
loa'ds of hogs and cattle from the Lo­
cal Shipping association of Kulm, re­
cently organized. Mr. Bowman is very
enthusiastic over the Equity Co-oper­
ative Exchange and the livestock de­
partment which they are forming, and
reports that the livestock from Kulm
will be marketed through this selling
agency which will be owned and con
trolled by the farmers themselves. Mr.
I Bowman was recently a candidate for
the state legislature and endorsed by
the Non-Partisan league. He had
about three hundred majority over
his nearest competitor, which indi
I cates that he will be an easy winner in
the fall election and will be the repre
sentative at Bismarck from his dis
trict.
Mr. F. B. Wood of Fargo, North Da­
kota, a director of the Equity Co-op­
erative Exchange and a member of
the executive committee, arrived in
St. Paul Sunday evening with Mrs.
Wood and their daughter, Gladys. The
Woods will make their home during
the coming fall and winter in St. Paul.
Mr. Wood will devote much of his
spare time to the livestock branch of
the Equity Co-operative Exchange.
Mr. A. J. Axtell, the traveling rep­
resentative of the Equity Co-operative
Exchange in North Dakota, has been
visiting a few days in St. Paul the
past week. Mr. Axtell has been very
.successful during the past summer,
organizing farmers' elevators and se­
curing new business for the Exchange.
He made the trip by auto and was ac­
companied by Mrs. Axtell and two of
their children.
CORN
SHOW
Midwinter Fair at Minot Will Special­
ize in Corn and Poultry Exhibits
at the Coming Fair
Not too Early to Make Selections for
Exhibition Purposes—Exhibitors
Should Make Preparations
With the hope of encouraging the
raising of more poultry and corn in
this part of the state the Midwinter
Fair to be held in Minot the fore part
of the coming year will specialize in
these two departments. Last year a
real good poultry show was held, but
on account of late announcement it
was not as large as it should have
been, while the corn crop last year
was not anything to brag about. But
this year corn has turned out well and
there is no reason why a cracking
furine
I
ood corn show should not be held
the Fair.
Poultry is becoming quite an item
in this part of the state. In Ward
county alone there is over $26,000
worth of poultry, and other counties
adjacent will show up just as well, so
there should be thousands of birds
entered in the show. Arrangements
have already been made for the ser­|Misses
vices of an experienced poultry man
to have charge of this department, and
INDEPENDENT
numerous inquiries have been received
at the office of the Secretary of the
Minot Association of Commerce from
poultry fanciers in this part of the
state, so that there is small doubt but
that this feature will be a great draw­
ing card.
The announcement of these features
I is made thus early for the reason that
the farmers of this section of the state
should be making their selections now
in order to have the best exhibits for
the Fair. It is none too early to give
this matter serious thought. Of course
other departments will not be neg
lected, so that people who intend to
exhibit anything in the line of grain,
grasses, fruits and vegetables should
be arranging their exhibits now in or­
der to be ready for the opening day
of the fair.
I There is another reason for calling
attention to the Fair this early, and
that is, that a small admission charge
will be made to those who do not have
exhibits in the Fair, while those who
have exhibits will be admitted free.
Bartelson Babe Died
Ethel Marion, the thirteen-months
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Carl
Bartelson, died Thursday evening at
the home of the parents on Valley
street, following a short illness. The
funeral was held from the Zion Luth­
eran church Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock, interment being made in Rose
Hill cemetery. The parents have the
sincere sympathy of their many
friends.
Schools Opened Monday With
Greatly Increased Attendance
The Minot schools opened Monday
with an increased attendance and with
the fifty teachers in the various city
institutions at their posts. The at­
tendance during the first week totaled
nearly 1,700. Practically every room
is crowded to its capacity and addi­
tional room must be provided at once.
POTTER STABBED
Local Man Mistaken for Another
John Kranopasch Is Held for
I Murderous Asault
I
Clarence Potter, who was mistaken
for another party, received a serious
gash in the abdomen just as he step­
ped out of the New York cafe shortly
after midnight Saturday night. John
Kranopasch, a Russian, who did the
trick, was arrested and at his prelim­
inary hearing, he was held to district
court under $1,000 bonds which he was
unable to furnish. The assailant had
trouble in the restaurant earlier in the
evening and lay in wait for the man.
Potter has been employed by Contract­
or Dinnie. The knife was forced thru
Potter's clothing towards his heart
and made an ugly gash. Potter is re
covering.
Many Speakers at Mass Meeting
At a mass meeting called at the
Savoy cafeteria Monday evening sev
entv-five members of the Association
of Commerce attended. After enjoy­
ing a fine spread, President Porter
called the meeting to order and stated
its purpose. He spoke of the plan to
reorganize the association if the mem­
bers deemed it advisable and after
Secretary Holbein had read a very
comprehensive report, showing the
work that tho association has done,
the members were given an opportuni­
ty to discuss the question freely.
Among the speakers were C. A. John­
son, A. G. Crane, W. H. Sibbald, E. A.
Long, K. Anderson, J. A. Roell. C. A.
Grow, O. M. Pierce, S. T. Condon. F.
I B. Lambert. W. C. McHugh, M. Mul
roy, K. A. Morgan, Ben Lesk, M. W.
Whalen and A. B. Dill. Whil some
suggestions as to changes were made,
all were unanimous on the fact that
the Association of Commerce was a
mighty fine thing for our growing city
and that it should be kept alive.
BLACKSMITHS WANT SEC.
G877 OF LAW AMENDED
The blacksmiths and mechanics of
North Dakota are having petitions cir­
culated over the state, prayimr the
next legislature to amend Sec. 6877 of
the compiled laws of North Dakota
for 1913, As the lav now stands they
have no opportunity to file liens for
work done. No class of workmen are
beaten out of their hard-earned money
more than the blacksmiths and me­
chanics and the law ought to be
amended.
I TWO NAMES APPEAR ON
THE JUDICIAL BALLOT
While it should be generally known,
some have overlooked the fact that
there will be a fight for the judgeship

pear on the nonpartisan ballot in the

K. E. Leighton. the present incumbent,
and F. B. Lambert, will appear on this
ballot.

SECTION
FOLLOW ADVICE OF
Association of Commerce Directors
Meet Tuesday and Abolish Budget
Fund Now Commercial Club
The Board of Directors of the Asso­
ciation of Commerce met Tuesday af­
ternoon to discuss matters of extreme
importance to the organization, and
before the meeting adjourned several
changes were made that will make a
great difference in the affairs of the
asociation.
Pursuant to the resolution adopted at
the members' mass meeting Monday
evening, the board abolished the bud­
get fund and the secretary was in­
structed to combine the budget and
general fund in the future. Theoret­
ically the budget fund plan seems to
be a good one, but it has been found
to be a great handicap to the activities
of the association in that the general
fund was supposed to pay all running
expenses of the Association, but was
never adequate for that purpose. The
budget fund did not protect the mem­
bership either, for it has gotten so
that anybody that wished to would go
around with a subscription paper and
collect money for almost any purpose,
and for the reason that many of our
prominent businessmen were not
members of the association, this could
not be stopped. In other words, the
budget system did not work in Minot.
Another important matter disposed
of at the directors' meeting Tuesday
was the question of a name for the or­
ganization. F. B. Lambert, chairman
of the committee having in charge the
re-incorporation of the organization
under the caption of Minot Associa­
tion of Commerce, made the following
report, which was adopted and order­
ed filed:
"F. B. Lambert, chairman of the
committee on revising the constitu­
tion and by-laws, reports that he has
found it impossible to secure a suffic­
ient number of members to sign such
change, and therefore recommends
that the matter be dropped and that
the organization continue to act under
the original constitution and by-laws
first adopted, without, amendment, un­
der the name of Minot Commercial
Club.
The thanks of the directors was ten­
dered the budget committee for the
excellent work done during the past
year, and their resignations were ac­
cepted.
The minutes of the members' mass
meeting were read and the board will
at once adopt some plan for continu­
ing the club along the same lines of
the past three years, but the plan will
not be put into force until the return
of the Secretary from the annual con­
vention of national commercial organ­
ization secretaries to be held at Cleve­
land the 2oth, 26th and 27th of this
month, where it is hoped he will se­
cure some very valuable information
along this line.
Cily Beautifying League Will
Hold Prize-Awarding Meeting
Monday evening. Sept. 2". at the
Presbyterian church all interested in
city beautifying work will gather at
8 o'clock to see the prizes won in the
rear yard and vegetable gqrrlen con­
tests and in the flower and vegetable
show distributed to the successful con­
testants. All who made effort to win
the rear yard prizes should he pres­
ent. No one knows as yet bnt the com­
mittees who the winners of this con­
test are. The contestants themselves
will not know until they see tho views
of their property shown Monday eve­
ning. There is bound to be some sur­
prises when the names of the seven
prize winn.ers in this contest are made
known, for the prizes go to the prop­
erties showing most improvement, not
to the best appearing places. Slides
showing views of the properties enter­
ed at the beginning of the contest as
well as at the close will be displayed
showing conclusively the improvement
made. Other slides will also be shown
including some of Minot's best resi­
dences and some of her prettiest
views. Views of the property winning
the silver loving cup offered by W. E.
Holbein for property showing best ap­
pearance in both front and rear yard
will be included.
The program which follows below
will be found interesting from every
viewpoint. The musical numbers will
be rendered by soloists who always
give their audiences pleasure, and the
talks, which will be short and to the
point, are by men whose experience
especially qualifies them for places on
this program.
