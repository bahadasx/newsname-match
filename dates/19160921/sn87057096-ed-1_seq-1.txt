Will Cut Some Bad Corners.
The board of supervisors did an
if excellent day's, yuotfj^ test Saturday
when they arranged with the proper
ty owhers to set their fences back on
three bad corners on the Leon»Da
4-j vis City-Lamoni road. The first one
is at the E. Housh corner, just south
of C. M. Akes* residence, the next
vone is at the Ed Flora corner just
east of Davis City, and the third one
is at the Odie Adkins corner, a mile
soutn of uavis City. These are all
'V- dangerous corners, and when the
fences are set back the road will be
rounded instead of having a short
rV"v" square turn. The board agreed in
each case to pay the owners of the
land at"the rate of 9200 an acre for
what land is UBed.

New Location, for Leon Hospital.
The Leon Hospital which was put
out of business when the Baker
block on the north side of the square
was leased for a hotel, has secured a
new location, the residence known
as the W. P. Clark home on south
Main street, owned by. M. L. Dale,
having been leased by Drs. H. R.
Layton, F. A. Bowman and J. W.
Kobinson for a hospital. Mrs. Laura
former hospital will be in charge.
The property is being remodelled, a
new furnace put in and other im
provements being made. The doc
tors of Leon were up against it for
a hospital, for it is impossible to get
along these days without one.
Fire Losses Settled Satisfactory.
To Whom It May Concern:
We desire to state that recent fire
losses which have sustained, were
covered by insurance policies in the
Leon agency of Pease & Pease, and
that our losses have been settled
promptly and to our entire satisfac
tion. we cannot recommend Pease
& Pease too highly to any person
wishing to place insurance with a
reliable agency, where in case of
loss your interests will be well taken
care of.

The'advertising for the meetings is
to be of a simultaneous nature, no
individual church to do any advertis
ing, but all of the churches are to be
represented in each advertisement,
and all advertising must have the
approval of the Ministerial Alliance
before it is issued. This is a move
in the right direction, as it will dis
pense with the usual five or six
months revival meeting drag which
is the usual experience of the com
munity, and will also do away with
the usual competition for favorable
dates. It will demonstrate to the

to Leon Saturday and registered at

goods on Monday. Sunday he was
about the house all day, talking with

was noticed about lifm. He made an
engagement with another traveling

About 5 o'clock he was sitting in
front of the hotel reading a news
paper.. He got up from his chair,
folded the paper and put it in his
pocket and started to walk east on
Couimercial street. He did not re
turn for supper and has not been
seen or heard from since. His bag
gage and samples were left at the
hotel. It is very strange that he
should disappear so suddenly and
completely in broad day light. No
teams were hired from the livery
barns and there was no trains for
him to leave the city on. A tele
gram was sent to his firm Wednes
day notifying them of his disappear
