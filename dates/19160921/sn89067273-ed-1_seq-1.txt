BIRTHPLACE CF
MARK TWAIN
All Honda in Monroe County Lead to
It House Unlit in 1835 Ori
Kin of The Name "Mark Twain."
By Rev. II. li. Haiku.
It was the good fortune of tho
writer to visit recently the birth
place of Mark Twain at Florida, Mon
roe county, in company with Dean
Walter Williams of Columbia; Mr.
J. B. Powell, Instructor iu Advertis
ing in the University, and Edwin, son
of Mr. Williams. The Journey was
comfortably and quickly made for
Will, the chauffer, was master of the
machine and conducted us over the
hills and hollows with care and skill.
At Molino we were kindly greeted
by Dr. J.F. Flynt.the genial physician
of that locality, and Mr. P. H. Cau-
thorn, the' successful cashier and
manager of the Molino Bank. After
the usual questions had been asked
as to the purpose of the tall building
which stands on the west side of the
town, and the usual answers had been
given, we proceeded northward, past
the well-appointed farms of W. E.
Cauthorn, James Dudley, T. C. Hen
derson, Henry Fisher, J. A. Botts
and others; on to Santa Fe, the
northern terminus of the electric
line. The noonday lunch was spread
In the shady yard of Mr. Nelson Dull
near the village and after it was dis
posed of we set out to find the road
to Florida. That town resembles
ancient Home in one particular at
least, viz: that all roads If ad to it,
or seemed so from the various direc
tions received from different ones,
'each having his favorite route and
no two the same. After drawing
straws, so to speak, we chose our own
way and in due time arrived at our
destination.
Probably the chief point of inter
est to the visitors vat Florida is the
house in which ' Mark Twain was
born. It is a frame building of two
rooms, erected prior to 1835, kept
in as good repair as possible, and at
the same time so kept that its antique
appearance is preserved. The walls
and ceilings are rudely plastered
and neatly whitewashed. Rag car
pets cover the floors and the furni
ture, all of which is at least one
hundred years old, consists of a cord
ed bedstead and bedding of feathers
with counterpane of large white and
blue checks, a spinning wheel for
wool, one for flax, split bottom chairs
(no rockers) and tables on which
are plentifully displayed Indian rel
ics of various kinds.
Near the building: the State of Mis
souri has placed a monument to the
memory of Mark Twain. It consists
of a base and square shaft of Carth
age stone mounted by a bronze head,
the whole standing about twelve feet
high.
The house and grounds are jeal
ously and almost reverently cared for
by Mr. Merritt Violette, who cordial
ly welcomes all visitors and furnishes
any desired information.
Florida has not yet become a mec
ca for lovers of goocr literature and
admirers of great authors, and one
reason is the condition of the roads
in the region immediately adjoining
the village. The town itself is sit
uated at the confluence of Salt River
and North Fork and the gorges thru
which theses streams flow are deep
and the roads approaching the town
are steep "and somewhat rough. If
these near-by roads were put in good
condition for a mile or two out from
the town, they would run into rqads
as good as there are In the county
and the county as a whole Is famous
for the excellence of Its highways. .
"Mark Twain," as is well known, is
not the real name of the celebrated
writer, but the pen-name of Samuel
L. Clemens. Mr. Clemens once when
a young man was a. pilot on a Mis
sissippi River steamboat. The river
men at times took their soundings to
ascertain the depth of the water, and
as they cast the lead they called out
"Mark twain, mark twain," Instead
of "mark two," It is said that this
- suggested to Mr. Clemens the pseu
donym which he adopted and by
which he Is best known. 1 -
The Clemens family a few years
after the birth of our hero removed (
to Hannibal, Mo., where he spent hlS;or meeting some of the best people In
boyhood. His parents were poor and
his own struggle with poverty was
hard. ' If there are self-made uieu,
Samuel Langhorne Clemens was ouu.

trait of strict integrity; he was a
man of honor, his word was as good

CONCERNING THE TOWN OF
FARBER; HER CLAY AND COAL
Something About Her JJusiness Men, Her Farm
Territory and the Live Stock Interests.
A representative of the Message
visited the town of Farber a few days
ago. Farber is on the C. & A., be
tween Laddoula on the west and
Vandalia, east. The place has about
350 inhabitants.
Farber used to be one of the livest
trading points In the county, but for
eight or nine years she has not quite,
it must be admitted, kept in the van.
Lately, however, she is taking on
new life. A new coal company Is
getting out coal, putting a fine qual
ity of the black diamond on the mar
ket, supplying the local demand and
sending the product elsewhere. But White, 102 acres, east. C. J. Carr,

DON'T OVERFEED.
What doth it profit a man that he
gain the whole world and yet lose
hia health?
Naturalists say that long ago the
prehistoric waters were infested with
a species of enormous shark which
.'inally became extinct by reason of
the workings of its voracious appe
tite. Thus Nature eliminates the
over-fed.
The desire for ease of life aud
plentiful diet is universal and is the
groat stimulus of man and aimaly
alike. When man becomes greedy
and takes more case and food and
drink than is his share. Nature dis
cards him.
In the race for power and place,
for esse of circumstance and relief
in. 111 the stimulus of hunger, the
modern man is apt to forget that un
less he is careful of hi body he will
soon be made to suiter for the in
fraction of Nature's inexorable phys
ical law. With the loss in body tone
cornea an equal loss in mental acuity
and the brain which for a tune was
able to operate despite the com
plaints of an overfed, under-exercised,
sell-poised body, stops working.
statisticians have discovered that
the mortality rate of persons in the
I'uiied Stat-s over 4" years of age
'.i increasing. The strenuous life of
today is not alone responsible for
this, we are told. Lack of health
giving exercise, superfluity of diet,
luck oil restoring sleep, over-stimulation,
the high-pressure of the race
for power, wealth and position, plus
physical neglect, these bring eariv
decay. The goal is reached. Wealth
is amaised honcr, position and
power are ju.-,t being grasped when
the apple of accomplishment turns
to the ashes of dissolution. The
brilliant mind becomes clouded, the
steady hand is no longer accurate,
the eye which once gazed fearlessly
0:1 the whole world is dimmed and it
is not long before the final break-up
occurs. All of this was entirely pre
ventable. Other things being equal it is the
man who leads the well-balanced life
who laats the longest, whose work to
the end is uniformly the best,, he who
neither over-works nor over-plays,
neither over-eats, over-drinks, nor
oversleeps, ho maintains a standard
of, simple healthy diet in moderation,
who offsets mental work with physi
cal recreation, who is as honest with
his own body us he is with his own
business. When success conies to
such an one his physiccl and mental
eoiulitic.n is such that he can enjoy
in peace of mind and eonietmeiit of
iKidy the fruit:: of his labors.
The regulations of I'. S. Pulili.
Health Service stnto: "It is the duty
of officers to maintain their physical
as well as their professional fitness.
To
this end they si,all be allowed
time for recreation a-id study when
ever the'r oflicial duties will permit."
if the Government regards it as os-
sen,!'ll thet its sanitary experts shall
be "afPRuarded in this way, is it not
equally important to evry citi'en
he similarly maintain a high
