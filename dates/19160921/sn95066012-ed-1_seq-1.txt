Seventy Five Guardsmen Back from
Border Service
NEARLY AIL U. V. M. STUDENTS
Return in Excellent Health But Have
Had Enough of Mexico for a
Life Time.
Burlington. Sept. 20. Seventy men
of C company, 1st. Regiment or infan
try and the attached sanitary troops
of the Vermont National guard, com
manded by 2d Lieut, it. P. Um--rnge,
U. V. M., '17. arrived today at
Port Ethan Allen from Eagle Pass,
Tex. All of the men, with the excep
tion of tltree or four preparatory
school students, are students nt the
University of Vermont. They were tir
ed and travel-stained, having left their
border station last Friday evening, but
very happy and full to the brim with
stories of their experiences.
The returned guardsmen will oc
cupy the barracks of one of the ma
chine troops, until they are mustered
out and just when that will be no
body seems able to tell. The first in
formation was that the men would be
allowed to visit their homes on fur
lough until the arrival of the balance
of the Vermont National guard troops
on Sunday but it now seems probable
that they will remain at the fort ani
be mustered out with the balance of
the regiment.
Discharge from the federal service
merely relieves the militiamen from
further service as government troops,
but leaves them subject to call by the
state until their enlistment term an
state militiamen has expired.
Dr. Ouy Potter lienton, president
of the Unlevrslty of Vermont, with
several members of the university fax
ulty, arrived at the fort soon after th
boys detained and gave tnem a
hearty welcome. A large number of
Burlington people and many friends'
of the student soldiers from neighbor
ing towns also visited the post today
While the Vermont guardsmen art
all in the best of health and spirits
there can be no doubt but that they
are genuinely glad to be home. Most
of them agree that they have had
enough of Texas and seen enough of
Mexico during the time they guarded
the border to last them a lifetime
There ware 10,000 troops entrenched
at Kaglo Pass, 3000 of whom were
regulars, infantry, cavalry and field
armiery and the record ol the ci-
mont troops was second to none.

Session This Afternoon
SUBMIT WORKING AGREEMENT
Men and Officials Willing to Adjust
Differences and Situation is
More Hopeful.
I'ittsfleld. Sept. 21. Prospects for
a settlement of the General electric
strike at I'ittsfleld again seem rosy
with the announcement by Charles O.
Wood and Frank M. Bump, members
of the state bourd of conciliation nnd
arbitration, yesterday thai, after con
feiring with both side.-., they have a
plan to submit at a conference lo be
held this afternoon at 2 o'clock vynicn
they think will be satisfactory. The
board members' will remain in I'itts
fleld until they are satisfied with con
ditions and will also take a hand In
the spinners sliike. Mr. Wood said
esterday :
When the board is satisfied the
public will be satisfied. This strike
has become a public matter, as it Is
Injuring public interests. We have
iscertalni'd the essential points of dif-
etenee between the parties concerned
mil 11 ml that they are still willing to
onfer, that each side is willing to
settle the controversy, and this con
dition of affairs is encouraging, to say
the least.
"If we find that cither side is hold
ing out in an attempt to exhaust the
other ride and ahuiin thus concessions
lhat the) are not now willing to give
merely tor the purpose of obtaining
these concessions, we will take steps
to change their frame of mind. ,A
public hearing will he resorted to as
an extreme measure, for i is .. n ex
pensive and takes time. We will not
wait, however, much longer thau a
week before we shall call a public
learing. if the partleH are unable to
reach u settlement privately."
The board members' proposition
is intended to form a working ag-te-ment
lor the General electric com
pany and its employes which will be
satisfactory for the future as we.: as
for the settlement of the present -!i:!i
ulty.
The publicity committee of the
strikers said yesterday that conditions
are satisfactory and that no more em
ployes were working yesterday tha'i
the day before. Systematization nf
picketing work has been undertaken
and various unions have elected pick
etlBf committees to have charge of

No official statement was given out

Messrs Wood and Bump will also

RENEWED MURTJ FR MEST
Bf STRIKING
Surface Cars Attacked and a Hum-
berof Persons Hurt
POME MAKE MANY ARRESTS
Hope of Averting Threatened Strike I
of 700,000 Union Workers
Monday Diminishing.
New urk. Sept. 21 Rioting was
renewed lust night in connection with
the car strike, after efforts of
Mayor MitChel and others had failed
during the day to effect a settlement
of the differences. Several hundred
strikers and their BJ mpathizers, who
attacked lour surface cars, engaged
in a running liglii with police reser
ves, during which several persons, in
cluding a woman, were hurt. Many
arrests were made.
What the police characterized as a
conspiracy to nse dvnamite in the
strike was frustrated by the arrest of
a man who asserted he was a strik
ing motorman. The prisoner, it was I
said, had attempted to buy explosives
from a laborer in a new sr.bway ex
cavation. The latter reported the
case to the authorities, who set a trap
ior the striker. When arrested at
the laborer's home last night. after
two dummy packages made up in the!
form of dvnamite had been passed to
him. the prisoner is alleged to have
declared he bought the explosives to
"blow up" a couple of Broadway cars.
When Police Commissioner Woods
was told that six-years-old Louis Ito-
dc Hi was dying, a victim of a brick
hurler, he redoubled his efforts at
clearing roof-tops contiguous to the
traction lines and went into confer
ence with District Attorney Swann to
provide for the ipeedy punishment of
such offenders. The commissioner Li-
sued a warning to the strikers that all
mi?siIe-throwcrs hereafter1 arrested
will be given the extreme penalty.
Hope oi averting the threatened
strike of 79,0,000 union workers at New
York in sympathy with the carmen
was diminished. Mayor Mitchel an
nounced that a persona appeal he had
made to heads of the transit com
panies to treat with the strikers had
met with a flat refusal. Meantime
preparations were continued by the un
ion leaders for the "walk-out," which,
if carried out. may paralyse Industry
throughout the greati r city. Appar-i
ently the only chance now of calling
6(1 the union officials in their determi
nation to "tic up New York"' by Mon
day next, It was said last night, lies
in a conference to be held today be
tween a citL.ens' committee and the
strike leaders. Samuel OomperSi
president of the American federation
of labor, and 2S presidents of inte''-
national unions, who arrived yester
dav, held a conference, but no definite
action was taken regarding a genera!
strike. It was said I hey would meet'
again tomorrow.
