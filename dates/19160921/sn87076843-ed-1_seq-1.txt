MORSE SCHOOL REUNION
A school reunion was held at Dis
trict No. 0, August 30, 191C. All who
had ever attended this school and all
former teachers were invited. Old
schoolmates and teachers met and ex
changed reminiscences. A strong feel
ing of good fellowship pervaded during
the entire meeting. After the picnic
dinner had been enjoyed the meeting
was called to order by J. D. Greiner,
who acted as chairman. It was unani
mously agreed to make a permanent
organization. The following officers
were elected for the coming year:
President J. D. Greiner.
Secretary Mrs. S. E. Wagoner.
Treasurer Frank Kurfis.
It was voted to meet next year on
tho last Wednesday in August.
A short program was rendered con
sisting of short talks by former teach
ers, music and a short talk by the
present teacher, Miss Faye Wagoner.
The following selection was read by
Mrs. Josephine Blue Scott, who taught
at District 9 in 18G5.

About a week or ten days after
the events which have already been
narrated took place, our, town had
another pole-raising. This time it
was the other political party that
did the business. The Democrats
of Perrysburg and vicinity had se
cured two fine hickory trees and
had them spliced together, (with
the brushy part of the top section
tied in such a manner as to resem
ble a broom,) which made a very
fine pole indeed. It was fully as
long, if not longer, than the pole
the Republicans had erected a short
time previous.- The location selec
ted for this hickory pole was on the
northeast corner of Louisiana ave
nue and Second street, in front of
the building erected a few years
ago and occupied by the Perrys
burg Banking Company. There
had been a heavy rain early in the
morning of the day chosen for the
raising, but during the forenoon
the clouds broke away and by noon
it had cleared up, and an immense
crowd of faithful Democrats from
the village and township had gath
ered for the occasion. A. L. (Lock)
Scott seemed to be the master of
ceremonies for this raising, and
while watching him putting the
finishing touches to some braces

the pole, he, together with a passer
by, frightened me very much by
saying that the old cannon was
"again to be used for firing a salute
during the ceremonies. However,
I was frightened over nothing, as
no salute was fired.
Early in the afternoon, when the
"shears" had been rigged up and
block and tackel in proper 'shape,
tho. mnn fell in line fit thi Innir
hoisting rope, and at a signal from
the one in charge, tugged at the
rope with a hearty good will, and
in a very few minutes the pole
stood erect, earth was thrown into
the hole around it and firmly tamp
ed down, and braces erected to hold
it in position. Then, while three
cheers and a "tiger" were given for
Seymour and Blair, a large Amer
ican flag was hoisted to the top
and floated to the breeze as proud
ly as did the flag across the street
on the pole of those of the opposite
political faith. All arrangements
for this raising had been very care
fully made, everything worked out
to perfection and there were no
mishaps of any kind, not even
minor ones, on this day. After the
pole-raising there was the usual
speech-making, without which an
occasion of this kind would not be
complete. Who the speakers were
for this day has gone out of my
memory.
Somehow or other the Democrats
of that time seemed to be a little
suspicious of their brethern of the
nnnncinnr nnrfv fnr pvprv nirrlif. f lin
halyards of this pole were drawn l
over and fastened in the window of
the second story of the building
occupied at that time by the late
Joseph Crabb as a grocery store,
and which was occupied for a num
ber of years by J. Wetzel & Sons
as a cigar factory. No doubt they
feared that some naughty Repub
lican would come in tho still of
night and pull the halyards through

Changing Seasons Bring Colds.
"Stuffed-up head," clogged-up noso,
tight chest, sore throat, are sure signs
of cold, and Dr. King's New Discovej-y
is sure relief. A dose of this combina
tion of antiseptic balsams soothes the
irritated membrane, clears tho head,
loosens the phlegm, you breathe easier
and realize your cold is broken up.
Treat a cold persistently; half-way
measures leave a lingering cough.
Take Dr. King's Now Discovery until
your cold is gone. For 47 years tho
favorite remedy for young and old.
Everybody is welcome to go
along with the winners. We will
visit Pitsburg; the mountains and
battlefields of Maryland and Vir
ginia; Washington, with all its
historic and sacred places; Balti
more, Philadelphia aud New York,
the greatest city in America. We
will be gone one week, beginning
December 4th.
More than four times as many
trips are pledged as last year and
more are coming. Domestic
science contests may be held up to
and including November 10th.

Reports at the Ohio Experiment
Station show that scab is more prev
alent in wheat this season than any
previous year, due to the weather
conditions favorable to its spread.
Cleaning seed wheat and treating
it with formalin will control this
fungus and prevent stink smut at
the same time.
The scab fungus is carried in the
diseased wheat kernels and after
seeding attacks the young plants.
With some varieties of wheat on the
Station farm about half the heads
Many of the lighter infected
kernels will be removed if the seed
is recleaned thoroughly in a fanning
mill. Scab spores will still be left
adhering to the sound grain. Seed
treatment as used for stinking
smut of wheat is also recommended
by the Experiment Station botan-
I ist. One pint of formalin (40 per-
cenfc formaldehyde) is mixed with
u Sauons 0I wacer xms ,s
thea sprinkled over the wheat
sPread 0D a ht floor or canvas.
i
One gallon will treat one bushel of
grain. After two or three hours
the grain should be spread out to
dry and then handled in bags and
drills disinfected with the same so
lution. Iltch! Itch! Itch Scratch! Scratch!
Scratch! The more you scratch, the
worse the Itch. Try Doan's Oint
ment. For eczema, any skin itching.

Constipation the Father of Many Ills.
Of the numerous ills that affect hu
manity a large share start with con
stipation. Keep your bowels regular
and they may be avoided. When a
laxative is needed take Chamberlain's
Tablets. They not only move tho
bowels but improve the appetite ami
strengthen the digestion. Obtainable

IH LIFE'S FLIGHT
YOU'VE read about Orville Wright's success with his aeroplane stab
ilizer, the balance wheel of flight. In life's flight you need several
balance wheels. For instance, you need the balance wheels of
honesty, of morality, of physical well being, of money. One might write
a column about life's stabilizers. Instead we suggest that you THINK
