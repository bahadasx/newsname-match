LAFAYETTE, Ind.. September 21.-'
Charles E. Hughes, addressing his sec
ond audience of the day in the open air
here today, outlined the policies for
which he stands, and declared that he
wanted to see in the United States "a
great driving force of patriotic senti
ment" which would furnish the motive
power for progress.
"I want American rights protected
throughout the world," Mr. Hughes
said. "I desire to see a great driving
force of patriotic sentiment which will
give us the motive power of progress.
We cannot have progress unless we
have that loyalty and love for our
country which will enable us to get up
steam to supply energy. And there
fore. that we may have that. I say that
American rights must be protected
throughout the world, with respect to
American lives, property, and com
mercfc with respect to all nations of
the world/'
Hits "Surrender to Force."
The nominee reiterated his declara
tion that the "pathway of surrender to
force leads only to civil war in the
end": declared that he Stood firmly for
arbitration of industrial disputes, and
added that as the friend of labor he
would not take the "first step along
that pathway."
: "I - am the friend of labor," he said.
"Who is not the friend of labor? If a
man Isn't the friend of labor lie Isn't the
friend of America, because we are all
laborers In this country, and we have all
got to go up or down together."
Mr. Hughes went Into detail concerning
his tariff views.- He quoted Henry Clay
In support of'his declaration that the
doctrine of a protective tariff was not a
partisan doctrine, .but "a sound American
doctrine."
Must Have Protection.
The protective tariff, he said, would
have to be applied to enable America to
meet European competition after the war.
"If, it is not," he said, "we wfll not only
have a repetition of the period of unem
ployment that we had lost before the

True American Defined. - ? -
Mr. Hughes defined a true American
as follows:
"The man who is a true American Is
one who rejoices in the vfctbrlei of'our
Institutions In giving opportunities in
which everybody shall have' a share,
not a selected few, but the diffusion of
prosperity among the .great, mass of
people in this country.
"It is Idle to say that we cannot go
ahead because there may be abuses.
We can put out the abuses and go
ahead at the same time.
"When a party is in power the best
tbing- lt can do for its own good Is to
demonstrate that it holds the standard
of public administration above the
petty demands of partisanship."
Mr. Hughes spoke for only twenty
minutes at the suggestion of the throat
specialist wlto accompanied him. The
nomlnee's'voice was husky and showed
the effects of constant speaking in the
open air.
Before making his address here Mr.
Hughes spoke from the rear platform
of his car to a crowd at Monon, Ind.
In this address he outlined his stand
on the Issues of the campaign.
The Hughes special train left Lafay

Result of Democratic Laws
MILWAUKEE Wis.. September 21.?
Charles E. Hughes, before a cheering au
dience that filled the big auditorium here
last night, outlined his attitude toward
the protection of American rights as fol
lows:
"I propose that we shall protect and
enforce American lights on land and sea
without fear and unflinchingly with re
spect to American lives, American prop
erty and American commerce. We have
no unstated policies, no sccret under*
standings, no intrigues. We stand tour
squared to the world, representing the
United States and Its interests?and its
Interests alone?first, last and all the
time." .
Mr. Hughes' reference to American rights
was contained In a speech in which he
made reply, one by one, to what he term
ed democratic claims for having aid?d
business, and outlined the republican pro
gram. In doing so he dealt chiefly with
subjects discussed In. President WHson's
speech of acceptance.
Shipping Bill a "Menace."
The shipping bin was characterised as
"a menace, the sooner removed the bet
ter." The Underwood tariff he called a
measure "that must be undone If we are
to have a sure basis; of prosperity in this
country." He reiterated that the anti

COMMITTEE IS NAMED; ^
RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED
Directors Ask Aid of Board of Com
missioners?President Horan
Thinks Chances Good.
The board of directors of the
Chamber of Commerce today took
action toward waging an active
campaign to have the federal
armor plant located in the District
of Columbia.
President P. T. Moran, in accordance
with resolutions presented by A. Left
wich Sinclair, and unanimously adopted
by the directors, appointed a commit
tee which has authority to do all in its
power to bring about the location of
the plant here.
Copies of the resolutions were ordered
sent to the President of the United
States, the Secretary of the Navy, the
Secretary of War, the chairmen of the
committees on naval affairs and of
military affairs of both the Senate and
the House of Representatives and to
the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia. The Commissioners are
urged to "add their' indorsement" to
the plan of bringing the plant to the
District.
President Horan Optimistic.
In bringing up the matter of estab
lishing this great government factory
ln the National Capital, President Mo
Iran said:
"Washington has as good a chance, if
not better, as any of the states which
have presented their claims. Some
think the people of the District, not
having a voice in the government, will
not have a chance, but I say to you that
we have an excellent chance."
The campaign committee named con
sists of Mr. Moran, chairman; A. Left
wlch Sinclair, John O. Capers, Chapin
Brown, Merritt O. Cfaance, D. J. Kauf
man, William T. Galliher. H. B. F. Mac
farland, William F. Oude and Joseph
A. Berberich. '
The resolutions urging the location
of the plant In the District set forth, in
part:
"The District of Columbia, the per
manent seat of the government of the
United States, possesses peculiar ad
vantages and facilities for the federal
armor plate plant, recently provided
foir by Congress; and the District, for
many reasons which readily suggest
tfeanselves. Is the moot suitable and
appropriate place in the United States
for the establishment of such vlant."
Idea Creates Enthusiasm.
Little discussion attended the passage
of the resolutions. The meeting had
been called principally for the pur
pose of considering the proositlon. A
large percentage of the directorate was
present and, apparently, most enthu
siastic over the proposition.

some of the trade unions were opposed
to it owing to the fact that they have
contracts with their employers which
would be violated by a strike.
