ing Tonight.
(By United Press)
New York, Sept. 21.The traction
strike situation is approaching a
crisis Today is the last day labor
leaders gave officials for considera
tion. There is no sign of either side
waivering.
Rioting was renewed here last
in connection with the car
strike after efforts of Mayor Mitchell
and others had failed during the day
to effect a settlement of the differ
ences.
Several hundred strikers and their
sympathizers who attacked four sur
face cars, engaged in a running fight
with police reserves. Many arrests
were made.
Hope of averting the threatened
strike of 700,000 union workers here
in sympathy with the car men were
diminished.
Apparently the only chance now of
calling off the union officials in their
determination "to tie up New York"
by Monday next, today Mes in a con
ference between a citizens' commit
tee and the strike leaders.
Approximately 10,000 women, wives
of the striking car men and members
of trade unions will act as pickets,
beginning tonight.

complimented for her good dairy con

temperament. In 1907, when Mr.
Schroeder started in the dairy busi
ness, with the help of A. J. McGuire,
her .bought some fairly good grade
coirs .And selected a Holstein sire
from the herd of a Wisconsin farmer.

selecting a bull from the herd of Wil
liam Jeans, who handles stock from
the John Irvin farm .near St. Paul.
Jeans carried away thirty-six prem
iums at JtfiiS year's state fair, with his
herd. At tha_ present time Mr.
Schroeder has in_ his nerd number
of cows that are seven-heights pure
bred and a number of Holstein heif
ers that gjye promise of keeping up
the production standard of the herd.

Mr. Schroeder, "and intend to keep on
improving my stock."
