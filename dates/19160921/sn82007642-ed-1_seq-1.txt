J
s Woodrow Wilson is President.
Dr. Euge.ne C. Brooks, profess
or of education at Trinity Col
lege, has given to the country a
most notable addition to its lit
eraturein bin latest book, Wood
, row Wilson as President," just
from the press, giving one of the
most vivid pictures of Woodrow
Wilson as a man, and the record
ot his four years' administration
- that has yet been issued. It is a
; book worthy of the man of whom
i; tells, and is being given high
commendation.
In his publication Dr. Brooks
traces the history of the Monroe
Doctrine and shows how it has
been expanded by the Wilso n ad
ministration. Also how a solid
foundation and broader friend
ship fdr more direct trade rela-
; .fttions between North America and
If South America has been laid.
' The author connects President
Wilson's Mexican policy with this
nw Pan-Americanism, and
weaves in the European war and
its effect td show the unprepar
eduess of the United States at
the present time. Possibly the
brightest line in the book is that
which places President Wilson's
. great loyalty and "America
first" policy so attractively be
fore the reader. The logical way
in which the effect of the Europe
an war on commerce, finance, in
dustry, and even education is
.shown, grips the reader from the
- first chapter to the conclusion,
and with all tttis. the argument
. for our present prosperity is pro
ving aud conclusive, showing
that, without Wilson's execu
tive ability and foresightedness
there wffuld be shadows of war
hovering about America today,
even if we were not already in
volved in war.
The two concluding chapters in
the book are most attractive, be
cause one deals with Woodrow
Wilson as a man's man, giving
vivid pictures of his love for the
' simple life, his sense of humor
and his method of securing co-operation.
Forcibly written, it
shows Dr. Brooks as a student
' of politics, while in diction it is
' brilliant, in style most attrac
tive. A chapter of the book that
gives selections from many of
Wilson's addresses is a valuable
addition to the volume, and as is
well said by a literary critic in
V Louisville Courier-Journal.
- "The President himself is no foe
v (man to be despised when it comes
to wielding a pen, Mr. Brooks'
style is entertaining and his dic
tion does not suffer when com-
pared with Wilson, which is no
mean test."
Dr. Brooks will be congratula
ted by his many friends in North
- Carolina for this splendid work,
and many will read "Woodrow
Wilson as President" because he
wrote it as well as because it
tells about America's firsst citi
zen. The newspapers of the coun-
x try in a large degree arccommen
ting upon the book in the most
favorable terms, and Democratic
campaigners will find that they
will gain both information and
- inspiration from its leading.
Terming Wilson the champion of
the jtfople, though held by some
to be an untried leader when the
', , nomination for President came
' to him he points to the real lead
ership which the Psesident has
so well and bo signally exercwed.
It the course of the book he of.
.''fers strong support to the Presi
; dent in the attacks he has made
on monopoly, his position on the
C v tariff, and the program which he
has pursued as to the currency

How Shall We Rate the Girl of Today?
Now that everything underthe
sun Jis being given an efficiency
ratiug, there is more and more
and more speculation as to just
how a girl fits into the scheme of
things and just what her rating
is from a purely unbiased point
of view.
There was a time, of course,
when a girl was supposed to be
made of "sugar and spice and
everything nice," but it is diffi
cult to make (these component
parts sum up all that is required
of the business girl of today, and,
along with a lot of other polite
little fictions, this must go by
the board and man, mere man,
must be able to see, even in the
girl he adores, something more
substantial than elements which,
all right while they last, are not
at the same time guarateed sun
proof, dustproof, fly-speck proof,
nor all wool and a yard wide, and
so on, ad lib.
One of the hardest jobs in the
world has been handed out to the
girl who would "a wage-earning
go," and she is rarely given cred
it for the competent way in which
she manages to win a place in
business affairs, and still retain
her characteristically feminine
traits so that, some fine day, she
can step back into the home and
resume a position which, impor
tant as it is, is still subordinate
to the main job of being the
family bread-winner.
It is just in proportion as a
girl can keep her poise, can meet
business exegencies competently,
and still be willing gracefully to
efface herself when the one man
in the world appears and claims
his mate, that we are beginning
to rate the girl of today. There
was a time when he placed undue
emphasis upon the business side
of .her career; and talking long
and loud on the necessity of
training every girl to be the ar
biter of her fate, leaving man to
his more or less deserved fate,
but we are now beginning to cor
relate and discover that, in trai
ning a girl for a busiuess career,
we are' at the same time giving
her the best possible prepara
tion for qualifying in the extrac
ting roll of homemaker and pac
ificator. The passing of the clinging vine
type of girl has in no wise imper
iled -the sanctity of the home.
Rather, it has assured to t h e
young men the probability of se
curing wives who shall be help-
meats in the truest sense of the
word, flinging vines are all right
ornamentally, but the man who
expects to stand the strain of
modern business competition
doesn't look forward complac
ently to securing a wite whose in
dulgence in hysterics is going to
keep bis own nervous system be
low par a greater part of the
time.
Tne business girl 01 today is a
perfectly normal young woman
who has added to her faith, poise,
to her hope, trust; to her love pa'
tieuce and understanding; and,
greater than these, she has ac
quired a keen sense of humor
which is more needed than any of
the o.ther virtues enumerated
it stands to reason tnat no
up-to-the-minute girl can associ
ate daily with men in any busi
ness without knowing more a
bout the idiosyncrasies of the
male sex than was ever set down
in any of Hamlet's soliloquies.
But to the everlasting credit of
the power of woman s forgive
ness, be it said that this Barae
girl will actually marry one of
tne men wnoseieeimgsand short
sightedness she so well knows,
and the men in the case will nev
er, neyer, at any stage of the
game, know when she is secretly
laugning at mm.
If such a girl isn't to be rated
ninety-nine plus, who is? Harri

The Single Term.
Some day in the distant future
perhaps, the people of this na
tion will come to realize the ne
cessity for a longer presidential
term than is now the order, a term
of six or eight year. Such an in
crease of time would not only en
able the incumbent of the white
house chair to work out needed
legislation, but would allow him
to complete work which begins in
a four-year term. Americans are
accused of extreme nerousness,
and many and vauied are the
causes assigned therefor, among
others the spirit of commercial
ism which pervades the land. Be
this as it may, there is no doubt
that we are usually found build
ing up and tearing down, only
to begin our building over again.
n the case of the four-year presi
dential term, as we have intima
ted, there is scarcely time for the
president to begin his work, much
less finish it.
It ,is generally admitted that
President Wilson has achieved
much in the three years and a
half of his administration, but,
as is the case of many ot his
predecessors, before he can wit
ness the operation of the vari
ous enactments which he advo
cates, he is compelled to enter
the sqramble for another presi
dential term and, of course face
the possibilities of defeat. Should
the Republican party be succeKS
ul much that the present admin
istration has accomplished will
be undone and a new order ol
things instituted. And so it goes;
every four years the country is
thrown into a politicul turmoil
and uproar, ere it has recovered
rom the effects of a previous
campaign, and nothing h on sol
id ground. . The permanency of re
form exists only in imagination
every thingjmust change. Much
of this, though not all, would be
avoided by instituting a presi
dential term of six oreight years
for in either period the country
would have a chance to settle
down and enjoy uninterrupted
business. Strange to relate, na
tional conventions go on record
as advocating tne single term
but their utterances are soon for
gotten. As recently remarked in
these columns, national plat
forms as a rule sound very in
spiring, but they . .are, seldom
translated into deeds. Ash ville

road from Lenoir to Blowing
Rock, f he cost of which will be
$150,000 or more. The propos
ed work has been mapped out by
highway engineers. Nothing but
automobiles and auto trucks are
to be allowed on the road. It is
said that the promoters have al
ready an offer of $20,00l)a year

Fortunately, America can play
her part in the days to come un
selfishly und impartially, because
she covets nothing that other
nations have unless it be their
skill und knowledge in some ol
the undertakings of science and
industry, and .these things she
can obtain not by conquest of
force, but by the earful use of
the extraordinary capacity of
her people. She can produce like
skill and knowledge for herself.
This is one of , the, things these
days of struggle and ..interrup
ted trade have taught her, She
has nothing that .she wishes to
take away from the other,na
tions of the world, and she is bet
ter preparedjthan she .ever was

tion to the development of other
