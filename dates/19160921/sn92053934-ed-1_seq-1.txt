today discussing with the Mexicans
documentary reports relative to gen
eral conditions in Mexico.

themselves in the afternoon, the Joint
conference being adjourned until to
niofrow. Washington. Sept. 21. An official ac
count of"Villa"s raid on Chihuahua City
last Saturday, received at the war de
partment today from Brigadier Gen
eral Bell at El Paso says the bandit
chief captured some of Carranza's ar
tillery and 16 automobile loads of
arms and ammunition, liberated 200
prisoners from the penitentiary and
made off after being joined by from
1,000 to 1,500 soldiers of the garrison.

YANKEE SHIPS IN
TRADE OF PACIFIC
United States Leads the World In Num
ber of Vessels Now Under
Construction.
Washington, Sept. 21. The turning
point in the fortunes of American ship
ping on the Pacific was marked by the
recent purchase of three large ships
by the Pacific Mail Steamship com
pany, "and there is no further dan
ger of the American flag disappearing
on the Pacific," a department of com
merce report announced today. It also
pointed out that the European war
has cut down the total shipping of all
nations engaged in trans-Pacific trade
from 380,000 gross tons to 280,000.
The Pacific Mail company's pur
chase, the report says, adds 17,100
gross tons to the 5,000 tons that re
mained of American shipping on the
Pacific. Prior to the war the total
American tonnage engaged in this
trade was 80,000 gross tons, or 21 per
cent of the total, as against British
shipping's 39 per cent and Japanese 33
per cent. Up to the Pacific Mail pur
chases, American shipping had fallen
off to two per cent, British to 30, while
Japanese tonnage had Jumped to 55
per cent of the total and Dutch ship
ping, formerly practically nothing, to
13 per cent.
The report says that Japanese ship
yards are taxed to their capacity and
orders for Japanese ships have booked
their yards for two years ahead. In
cidentally the Chinese are busy at their
Shanghai and Hong Kong yards.
"The United Slates," the report con
cludes, "has more merchant vessels
under construction than any other
country in the world, and while the
greater part of this new tonnage is not
intended for immediate use on the Pa
cific, it is probable that sooner or later
some of it will be diverted to the far
eastern trade. Whether American
shipping will fully regain its former
standing in the Pacific cannot be defin
itely foretold."
