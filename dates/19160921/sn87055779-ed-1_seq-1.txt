State Department Informed
Czar's Country Will be
Unable to Act While
War is on.
WARRING NATIONS WILL
PASS ON RESOLUTIONS
Own International Business is
Placed Before Trade With
United States Many
Treaties About to Expire.
JotrruutioLuil News Service;
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. The
"trade put" f the entente ulhe
has ahsolntely Mocked negotiations
for the proposed new commercial
treaty with Kusvia. which Ainb.'in
sudor lavij It. Franc;-- of St.. Ioiiis.
took to retrograd home months ai?o.
According to information reaching
the state department today the
Fr.ited States will timl it impossiMe
to arrange either modification or
n'w commercial treitie with any of
the entente allies, until they have
l om Juded their ""all for one, and one
for all" after the- war trade arranne-
nint.
According" to the present (utlool;
the allied negot i.i ion on this prub
Jem will not he ended until the war
i.s over and the atfeM on American
trade must of necessity, he very
serious.
Samuel N. Harper, professor of
ecmioiiiii m at the Fniversity of Fhi
cago who accompanied Ainba --sudor
Francis to Peti ograd. and who has
been unofficially interested in the
Kussian treatv negotiations, today
reported to the state department and
the depa 1 1 1 1 le n t of otn rnerc regard
ing conditions in Luskin.
No Pngre.s Made.
He mad it clear that the com
mercial conf -re nee of the ent'-nte
allies at Pari and the determination
of that conference to endeavor to
effect a cooperative commercial ar
rangement among the belligerent
nations had hlocked progress in
Petrograd. The Pussiun foreign of
t.ce tlatly told A tn 1 x-sad or Francis
th.:t it could not take up the Amer
ican tr aty until the commercial po
sition of Pussia as to the allie had
oeen definitely fettled.
ThA Pari conference framed reso
lutions, to he ratified hy the ariou
individual belligerents, committing:
all of them to join the commercial
activity after the war. Mr. Harper
said that no step toward pres.-in.;
the American treaty could he taken
until these resolution had heen
actetl upon by the iiuvsian govern
ment. Thi action, he said. prob
ably would be delayed until the
close of the war.
The other entente allies are ex
pected to follow the lead of Rus
sia, and to decline to consider new
trade agreements to replace those
about to expire with the Fnited
States until their commercial ar
rangements with fach other are
complete. The state department
probably will deTermine to postpone
all efforts to secure commercial ar
rangements following the failure of
the Russian negotiations
Own lluslno. Fir-t.
According t" Prof. Harper, the
entente allies took upon their own
international business as of much
more importance than any negotia
tions with the L'nited States. He
uys that In the entente countries
the attitude toward h I'nied States
is expressed thus:
'America h.i. er.uned the fruits of
neutrality: she rm:t eentually pay
the penalty of neutrality."
The state uVj-ai tmer.t N confront
ed with the problen of negotiating
fCft!" of new commercial treaties to
replace pact which expire by limit
ation within the next few months.
Some of these are with the allied
powers and the attitude of Kusia
has upset all plans for these negotia
tions. SLAYER SHOT TO DEATH

Americans to Agree to

Intern itional New s Service :
NLW LONDON. Conn., Sept. 21.
Recommendation that the Pershing
column be withdrawn from Mexican
soil will bo agreed upon by the
Mexican and American commissions
"within a few days." This statement
was made today by one of the Amer
ican commisisoners lure.
The recommendation will be
hedged about with provisions, how
ever. While all of the details have
not been settled it i legarded as
most probable that the Americans
will succeed in convincing the Mexi
can representatives that a sufficient
force of Carranza soldiers must be
stationed between Yilla"s reported
whereabouts and the American bor
der to render the line perfectly safe
from bandit operations.
Tn addition it is probable that the
initial a'-rremeiit on protection of tho
border will be include. 1 in the plan
to be submitted to the Washington

ratification. That sLbjet will be
left open for elaboration, however,
