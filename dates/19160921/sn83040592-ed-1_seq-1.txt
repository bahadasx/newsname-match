between Science, History and the
Bible.
Part two commences with

ailments and are excellent. Easy

effect Obtainable everywhere.
Hardware Store Robbed.
E. M. Michener's hardware
store was burglarised Saturday
night, the second robbery in two
weeks. The thieves entered the
store through tbe back way.
They got away with $97.00 in
cash, a couple of guns, a revolver
and some silver plated ware and
razors. The outer 'door of the
safe was not locked. The inner
door was opened by cutting out
the lock with tools taken from a
near by carpenter ahop and some
found in the store. .
No clue .whatever was left
The work was done in the front
of the room and tbe men might
easily have been seen at work
had any one passed -a tbe light
which is left oa every mght was
not turned out by the burglars.
The general opinion is that
the thefts of late and the hold
ups is the work of parties living
not maay miles away.
A reward of $50.00 is offered
by the A. H. T. A. and Mr.
Michenerfor the capture of the
buralars and recovery of the
goods.

Well! Will! The Miami Record
Herald ia awfully excited about
women and children being such a
menace to lite and limb when
when driving automobiles. If
the women can be any more care
less or incapable than a good
many of tbe male drivers that
head their machines out of Miami
and Commerce they must be
terrible. As for children there
should be something done we
have thought, when we have
seen boys with a car full of boozy
men and women on the road from
Joplin.
Rev. Brown, the new Presby
terian pastor, is laid up with a
broken rib. While motoring back
from Blue Mound where they had
gone to preach, iter, uoopin
garner and Rev. Brown encoun
tered a raised culvert Tbey
were hurrying to avoid the rain
and going a pretty good rate.
The culvert was quite a bump
and threw the car up into the
air. Rev. Brown who was sitting
in the rear seat was thrown
against the top where he injured
his bead and down against the
front seat, where he suffered a
bron rib and was shaken up
quite badly. Rev. Hoopingarner
escaped injury. The car was
thrown quite high and it is a
wonder that it did not turn over.
Another Robbery.
Russell Parker was held np
Monday night and robbed. For
tunately he had but 35 cents on
his person. He and Abe Dardenne
bad been to Joplin. Oa their
return Russell left the car on
River street three blocks east of
Military and started for his home.
As soon as the car was out of
sight, a man stepped from behind
a tree and ordered him to hold
up bis hands. On finding noth
ing but tbe small change the
robber was sore and ordered
Russell to . beat it hard or he
would fill bim full of holes.
Russell obeyed.

Parent Teacher
Association Meets.
The Parent Teacher Associa
tion met at the Baxter Springs
school Tuesday of last week and
decided to have gas lights put in
the basement lower ball, upper
hall, and the high school assemb
ly room.
The meeting opened by every
one singing the atar bpaugiea
Banner. The fifth- and sixth
grades then sang a lullaby under
the direction of Miss Rowe.
Miss Dorothy Plum played an
instrumental selection.
During the course of the meet
ing many subjects were discussed
such as, parents co-operation
with the teacher, and play ground
conveniences and necessities.
Upon consideration it waa de
cided to leave the election of new
officers until the next meeting.
The several teachers and parents
who had had experience at other
parent-teachers associations gave
little talks on how the other
meetings were carried on and tbe
objects of the meetings.
The old idea of saving news
papers to sell was discardts as
being to inconvenient for the re
ward that would be bad. Some
thing was said about holding
fairs and other public entertain
ment for raising funds.
School Notes.
. Junior picnic
The Juniors of the Baxter high
school had a picnic or a weiner
roast last Thursday night. Tbe

There were not more than five
students out of the entire high
school who did not go. Tbe
party met at the post office at
seven o'clock and left a few
minutes after. There was a
plenty to eat and some left over.
Tbe Juniors did tbe inviting but
the other classes helped with the
eats. Tbe moon came up soon
after reaching the place, which,
by the way, was the mouth ot
the river. During the evening
games were played and weiners
eaten. The picnickers came back
at about 10 o'clock and everyone
bad tbe time of their life.

ancient history of the world
which is centered mostly around
Esrrot The museum contains
many specimens of the pyramids
and obelisks and thru the kind
ness of Mr. Perkins tbe class was
permitted to see them. The time
spent in viewing the relics wss
well spent. The visit was made
thru the arrangement of Mr.
Barrett, teacher of ancient
history.

and music books sent for, thru
the efforts of Miss Rowe he
high school hopes to have a fine
glee club
OVB K ALL BXIGAP.
At tho Junior picnic the boys
of tbe high school decided to
