Nominee Hughes Talking to
Boomers This Week in a
Rapid Fire Trip About
the StaAe.
TO SPEND THREE DAYS
jk't
Twelve Speeches Today, Thirteen To
morrow and Seven on the
,) Schedule For
4
Saturday.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LAFAYETTE, Ind., Sept. 21.—
Nominee Hughes started pursuit of
Indiana's electoral votes today in the
most "whirlwindy" campaign trip the
hoosier state has ever witnessed from
a presidential candidate.
For the next three days the re
publican aspirant for executive hon
ors will criss-cross the state preach
ing the doctrine of a republican tariff
for protection and assailing the
democrats for failure to keep their
promises. Today he had scheduled no
less than twelve speeches in various
cities, winding up tonight at Rich
mond.
Tomorrow thirteen Indiana towns
will hear him, and on Saturday seven.
Then he and Mrs. Hughes will have
a day of rest over Sunday at Indian
apolis, the guests of the candidate's
running mate, Charles W. Fairbanks.
To Indiana voters Hughes expects
to appeal for the most part on the
democratic tariff and business rec
ord. ,He has found it impossible to
cover all the ground of his assault on
the Wilson administration in abort
speeches inch as te nosi make- in
most or the citi«« on his schedule
during the next few days, so he plans
to sub-divide his talk—discussing the
tariff in one place, labor in another,
Mexico, business legislation, etc.
Indiana audiences may expect furth
er and stronger references to the Wil
son administration's course in the
matter of interference toy the British
with the mails. Hughes invariably
follows the same course in develop
ing his attack on those he takes
great pains to explain are "friends
and fellow Americans" on the other
side of the political battle. That
course Is first to let drop fust a hint
until It becomes one of his main
"punches." In Wisconsin yesterday
he dropped that hint early in the
day—very much veiled—but before
he left the state he had expanded it
so that the attack was unmistake
able. Those in his party expect him
to come out even more vigorously in
Indiana on this and on the question
of "Americanism" under which head
the republican nominee refers to
hyphenism.
One other thing which was de
veloped in the governor's speeches to
day at Monon and here was the way
in which he is taking the sting out of
his criticisms of the democrats by
disclaiming any personal issues and
lauding them as sincere in their aim.
"When I say 'our opponents,'" he
said in one speech, "I mean our
friends, because we are not seeking
to impose anything upon the Amer
ican people for the benefit of any
set of men. We are not a sectional
party. What is good for republican
business is good for democratic busi
ness. It Is for America we are work
ing and the point Is. what is the best
policy fbr all."
The meeting at Milwaukee last
night was pleasing and the biggest
the candidate has had at any time in
his campaigning. Hughes himself

NO SCRUPLES IN WAY
Story That Censors Confiscated Pen

in Germany, is
Denied.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, Sept. 21.—German propa
gandists are attempting to stir up bad
feeling between the United States and
Great Britain by the circulation of
false charges regarding the British
censorship, the British- foreign office
declared in a statement to the United
Press today.
"The German wireless news agency,
indeed, the whole system of German
propaganda, loses no opportunity of
endeavoring to create ill feeling be
tween Great Britain and our friends,"
said the foreign office. "When the
facts canot be distorted as to serve
the German purpose, no scrupVes stand
in the way of deliberate mendacity.
"A recent wireless message stgfted
that veterans of the American civil
war residing in Germany had failed to
receive their pensions for several
months, alleging that they had been
abstracted by the British censors.
'The allegation that British censors
confiscated moneys intended for such
persons is wholly false. It cannot be
stated too emphatically that notwith
standing the contraband proclama
tions and efforts made to intercept
funds enrouto to Germany for war
loan or other purposes, his majesty's
government has given strict instruc
tions that no remittance from the
United States to either Germany or
Austria shall be withheld when there
Is reason to suppose that such remit
tances are intended for the bonaflde
maintenance of American citizens in
enemy countries."

"Betted let us have him," said the leaider, "we are prepared to itake him."
The men cut loose with a volley of shots, and the officer yielded. But Mrs. Carroll
had disappeared in the meantime with the jail keys.
Determined, the mob battered in the jail doors and when the fire department attacked
the crowd with streams of water, they forced the firemen to retreat at gun points.
Seizing Dudley, the mob hurried him to waiting motor cars, threw a rope around his
neck, sped a quarter of a mile to the Frisco depot and hanged him to a telephone pole.
Dudley, an ex-convict and white, was convicted of first degree murder which carries
with it a sentence of life imprisonment.

ADDRESS WILL
BE
What President Wilson Will
Have to Say Before Con
vention of Grain Dealers
Come.
[By Robert J, Bender, United Press
S'aff Correspondent.]
ASBURY PARK, N. J., Sept. 21
Great importance is attached by the
democrats to President Wilson's ad
dress next Monday afternoon, before
tiie National Grain Dealers association
at Baltimore. What tbe president has
to say on that occasion and the ra
ception accorded liis speech, they be
lieve, will have a strong influence in
two of tho most important voting
strongholds of the country.
The grain dealers are in intimate
touch with the farmers. They a!so are
among the foremost shippers of the
country, Tvho, the railroads say, will
have to "pay the freight" as a result
of President Wilson forcing the eight
hour legislation through congress.
Appreciating the importance of the
address, the president already has be
gun work on it. It is likely to show
what the administration has done and
proposes to do for business and what
it has done for the farmer.
Before accepting any of the invita
tions before him, the president is
making a careful study of the nature
of the conventions, organizations, etc.,
before which he has been asked to
speak. Anything that savors of a
partisan meeting is discarded.

CROWD HARD TO HANDLE
Worst Outbreak So Far Last Night
When Sympathizers Had

Police.
[United Press Leased Wire gervice.]
NEW YORK, Sept 21.—New York's
traction strike situation approached a
crisis today. The last day which labor
leaders have allotted officials of the
traction companies to acept the pro
posals of Mayor Mitchel for further
negotiations, was ushered in ^ith in
creasing violence and with, no sign of
wavering by either side.
Unless their demands are met. un
ion organizers are prepared to call
tomorrow for the greatest walkout in
the history of the city, a sympathetic
strike of five hundred thousand union
workers.
President Shonts of the Interboro
announced today that the position of
the company "will not be altered un
der any circumstances." Organizer
Fitzgerald declared that "unless the
carmen's grievances are adjusted, a
general strike will certainly be called
Friday."
'Crowds of strikers and sympathiz
ers are growing more hard to handle
as the crisis in the situation draws
near. Five hundred strikers and their
sympathizers engaged in a running
battle with the police in Central park
west last night, ln the worst outbreak
since the strike began. A police cap
tain was knocked unconscious and an
aged woman seriously hurt.
The police department today united
with the district attorney's office and
the magistrates' courts in a determin
ed effort to stamp out rioting. Long
term sentences have been threaten
ed and more than a score now face
terms of from Ave to twenty years.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, has
got come out flatly In favor of the
sympathetic Btrlke, for which other
leaders are preparing today. He said:
"I am trying to help arrange an hon
orable adjustment of this horrible sit
uation. I want to bring about an
early settlement and I will do all_ ln
my power to aid the carmen."
The citizen's committee of seventy
five will confer with the mayor and
Oscar Straus, chairman of the public
service commission at three o'clock
today In a last efTort to bring about
a settlement of some sort. First
they will hear the side of the carmen
presented by Organizer Fitzgerald at
a conference which Gompers will at
tend.
The mayor, the police department
and city officials are now working
along two definite lines. One to pre
vent rioting, the other to secure
postponement of the effort to call out
a general strike.
Meanwhile, ln secret conference, the
union leaders are laying their plans
for the sympathetic walkout of union
workers throughout the city. While
the police several days ago were in
clined to doubt Fitzgerald's power to
call out those workers, statements
from union heads today tended to
show that at least some of them
would support the carmen.
Ernest Bohm, secretary of the Cen
tral Federated union, declared thai
"as a last resort" a general sympathet-
