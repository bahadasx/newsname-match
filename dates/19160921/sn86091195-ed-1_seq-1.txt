BLACKFOOT, BINGHAM COUNTY, IDAHO, THURSDAY. SEPTEMBER 21,1916

FOUR AUTOISTS
ARE FINED
The
i'ity officers have made up their
liùnds to enforce the ordinance relat
ing to fast and dangerous driving in
the city limits before some accident has
happened. With delivery wagons and
joy riders going at a pace of thirty and
forty miles an hour in the city, and es
pecially in the residential districts
where there are so many children, it is
a miracle that some one has not been
seriously if not fatally injured. The
good work began last Sunday, when L.
R. Aldridge, S. F. White and Ed Capps
were arrested by Officer Groscclose,
and Hay Eskelson on Monday by Chief
of Police Sewell, for being too speedy
in their cars. Police Judge Good who
fined them but $5 says he will not be
so lenient in the future with autoists
who violate the speed ordinance of a
limit of 15 miles an hour, which is fast
enough for any practical purpose, and
in fact too fast for safety.
A DANGEROUS FACE
Last Saturday afternoon C. S. Beebe
met with a rather strenuous accident
in which he and his car were badly
bruised. It is reported that he and Mr.
Johnson, salesman for the Bills garage,
were going along the county road nea:
Wapello when Beetle's car struck a high
place in the road and turned turtle.

vieted in Judge Bell's court last week

SCHOOL NOTES
There is no lull in the enrolment
either in the grades or the high school.
The high school now has an enrolment
of 2.30, which is exactly the enrolment
of Idaho Falls and three more than
the enrollment at Pocatello the first
week. The total enrolment in all the
grades is now 1134. This number will
be increased to better than 1300 with
in the next month.
The high school football team will
try out against a team of professionals
on Friday evening at the fair grounds.
Captain Howard Biethan promises that
the school boys will meet a well oifed
machine of experienced players. The
boys hope to make a good showing
against, their weighty opponents. The
first high school gnme will come on
Friday, September 29th, when the lo
cals will meet their old foe, Pocatello,
at the fair grounds.
The agriculture classes are among
the most enthusiastic of the whole
school. Their work is leading into very
interesting local conditions and the
boys feel that they have a rich, well
planned course ahead of them. Several
of the implement companies are being
asked to loan pieces of farm machinery
to the department for use as models in
the class room. Mr. Avery is outlining
a fine line of work for the short course
people who will come in the Monday
after Thanksgiving.
The domestic science department is
doing all sorts of canning and preserv
ing this week. The odor that comes
up from the kitchen during the morning
hours make the dinner hour seem a long
way off. All the classes offered in Mrs.
Jones' department are well filled and
the work is progressing in fine shape.
A contract lias been secured with the
Ridpath Lyceum Bureau whereby the
high school will put on the (famous
play, "The Melting Pot," by Zang
w'ill, at some date late in October. This
piny has been the sensation of the stage
for the past two years and the Rid
path people are making it their head
liner. They will bring ten well known
New York actors for this play and their
own special scenery. It is the same
company that goes to the larger cities
and the greater chautauqua circuits.
The school census lias been completed
and shows an increase of more than ltid
over hist year. This explains (In* crowd
ed condition of the schools, causing
now seats to be ordered and more room
to be provided.

the Beides Sugar Co. and held a very en
thusiastic meeting in which over 4,200

Thomas farmers last week and a good
acreage of beets was promised the
sugar company.
