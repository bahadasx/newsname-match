Hood River Valley 65 years ago. Mr.
Truqer is a native of Missouri. He
came to Hoed River from California.
He is a young old man, and though he
has retired from active life, his friends
find him full of activity, raising about
the best garden products to be had in
town on his place on East Sherman
avenue. Mr. Turner declares thst the
great development of the Hood River
Valley ia all due to the faith of the
Hood River mothers of early days.
Making a living on local ranches in the
extreme early pioneer days, he de
clares, was difficult. The men pos
sessing more of the roving tendency
would all have left bad the women not
demanded that they remain and build
permanent homes. Mr. Turner is a
musician of no mean ability, with his
beloved fiddle be will today render

oldtime favorites.
Newtown Clark, who will deliver the
formal annual address, will no doubt
weave into his nsrrative some of the
history of himself. He has lead an
interesting life. Lest in his modesty
he may not reveal all that he has done,
some of the high lighta of his early
day will be herewith reproduced.

E.L. SMITH CELEBRATES
HIS 79TH BIRTHDAY
The 79th birthday of E. L. Smith,
Hood River s grand old man, was cele
brated quietly at bis home Sunday with
only a few close relatives and family
friends present to partake of the birth
flav dinner.
While the name or Mr. smith is
closely linked with the pioneer history
of the three Pacific coast states. Call
forma, Washington and Oregon, be is
better known in the mid-Columbia die
trict than in any other section. He has
been known for many years an "Hood
River Smith, because of bis close con
nection with the local fruit industry
Over a quarter of a century ago Mr.
Smith planted one of the first local
commercial orchards on nis "ueuian
Land" estate, now owned by Oscar
Vanderbilt. For many years be was
president of the Oregon Horticultural
Society, land waa one of the moving
spirits of northwestern fruit interests.
Mr. smith was a member or the ure
gon Commission at the Pan-American
Exposition held at Buffalo, and was in
charge of the Oregon horticultural dis
play, which received the first award at
the intenational contests at the Buffalo
exposition.
Mr. Smith is perhaps the last sur
vivor on the Pacific coast who attended
the Chicago Republican convention in
1860 that nominated Abraham Lincoln
for the presidency. But a single dele
gate at this memorable convention sur
vives Col. Sawyer, of Byde'a Park,
Vermont.
Mr. Smith is a native of Vermont.
In 1858, accompanying a former in
structor, Prof. Isaac Parker, who was
called from New England to take the
chair of ancient languages at Lombard
University at Galesburg. lll.,Mr.smitb
came to the Middle West to become a
student at the Galesburg institution
It waa there that waa begun a romance
between the young man and Miss Geor
giana Slocom that culmiated in their
wedding on March 4. 1861. Mr. Smith's
wife was also a native of Vermont,
but at the time of the wedding was
resident of Woodstock, McHenry
countv. Illinois.
It was while astudent or comoaro
University that Mr. Smith, with aev
eral other students, admirers of Lin
coin, were given permission to attend
the Chicago convention.
"I waa present at every session of
the great convention," asys Mr,
Smith," "except that of the third day
after the great Lincoln bad been nomi
nated."
The wedding of Mr. Smith and Miss
Slocom hsd been planned for the morn'
ing of March 4, 1861. But waa post
poned until the afternoon at the re
ouest of the prospective bridegroom
"I was out of sympathy with the
administration of President Buchanan,"
say a Mr. Smith, "and 1 had the wed
ding postponed in order that my wife
and I could say that we were married
under the administration of Abraham
Lincoln. Immediately following the
eeremony and the felicitation of
frienda we left for Now York where
we took passage for California by way
oi ma laumua oi rename.
un arriving in tne uoiden state we
went at once to 1 Dorado county
wnete an uncie or mine, Charles Bar
ker, resided and at whose reaueata I
bad made my way west. I engsged a
numDar oi years in raining."
Later Mr. smith was elected a mem
ber of the California general assembly
serving in tins capacity during the
years 1864-1865. In 1867 he wasap-
poiniea territorial secretary or the
Washington territory. He and his
wife arrived at Olympia in 1867. Dur
ing a large portion of the time during
the period of hia office as territorial
secretary Mr. Smith waa also acting
territorial governor. At the oxn ration
of hia official duties, Mr. Smith, asso
ciated with Geo. A. Barnea. a member
or the nrst city council of Portland.
and William H. Avery, established the
first bank at Olympia.
Un March 1. 1876 Mr. Smith with his
family. "With my Larea and Penates."
as he today expresses it, arrived by
Columbia river boat at a sandbar sev
eral milea west of the present site of
toe city oi Hood Kiver. with lumber
shipped from Portland, a borne on the
large estate be bad purchased here had
already been erected. .
Mr. smith has made Hood River his
residence continually aince that date
except for a time when he was regis
ter of the United States Land Office at
The Dalles. In 1889 ho was speaker
of the Oregon House of Representa
tives, i
Mr. Smith and hia family have be
come widely known throughout the
Northweat. Mra. Smith, whose death
occurred in 1912, was a leading mem
ber of the Hood River Woman's Club.
She was beloved by all who knew her.
uuring her life she worked indefatia-
uably for the civic and social better
ment of the community. Her charities
extended throughout the Mid-Columbia
district among Indians and unfortunate
whites. Mr. Smith has four daugh
ters. Two of them, Mrs. William
Stewart and Mra. J. F. Watt, reside
in Hood Kiver. Mra. O. J. Nelson
and Mrs. William Rand live in Port
land. Despite hia age of 79 years. Mr.
Smith is hale, and ia known in Hood
River for hia stalwartnesa and sturdi
ness of tread. Faiilng vision has
robbed him of the pleasure of person
ally perusing bia favorite books. But
thia loss is mitigated by the care with
which Mrs. Watt takes in reading to
him. Daily the daughter reads Mr.
Smith the Morning Oregonian. and
after aha has pinned on the lapel of bis
coat bis daily bouquet, Mr. Smith
takes bis accustomed walk down town.
Throughout the week, be it rain or
shine, this walk is never missed, and
after bis promenade of the streets, Mr.
smith repaira to an orhce In hia build
ing to greet bis many friends who fre-
lently call on him.
In all the land there ia perhapa no
more tried or true Republican than
Mr. Smith. No one displays a greater
nterest in the coming election for the
Presidency than Mr. Smith, who de
clares himself optimistic over the suc
cess of the campaign of Justice
Charles E. Hughes and the return of
Republican principles in the handling
of national policies.
EAGLE CREEK CAMP
ATTRACTS VISITORS
During the month of August, 1420
visitors registered at the Eagle Creek
camp grounds on the Oregon National
forest. Ibis does not include all the
visitors, as many who picnic there on
Sundays do not take the time to regis
ter. There were 362 names placed on
the register the last Sunday in August.
These camp grounda are 45 miles out
of Portland and are adjacent to the
Columbia highway. A loop road from
the highway traveraes the camp
grounds, and gives easy access to the
numerous camp sites which nave been
cleared and fitted op for use by the
Forest Service. Water has been piped
to the grounds and system of sewers
installed, and a centrally located com
fort station has been erected for the
convenience of the public. Garbage
cans are placed at easy intervals for
public use.
f rom the camp grounds a pictur
esque trail leads up the canyon oi
Eagle creek. When completed it will
connect with the Herman creek trail
and make possible an attractive 22
mile trip from the highway at Eagle
creek to Wahtum lake, and then back
to the highway by the Herman creek
trail. The Eagle creek trail runs for
some distance on the side of a bluff.
where it was necessary to blast a pass
age out of the rock. The formation
resembles that of Shepherd's Dell on
the highway. A wonderful series of
wster falls on Eagle Creek will be
made accessible by this trail. Most
visitors at the camp grounda make the
trail trip as far as the point where the
contruction crew is at work.
A forest officer is stationed at the
camping ground and looks after fire
and aamtary conditions about the
place. A tent has served this season
as hia headquarters, but it ia planned
to erect a permanent ranger station
building in toe near future.
One on Hood River
Louia A. Henderson returned home
the latter part of last week from the
Camas Prairie country and Glenwood,
Wash., wbere be was investigsting
property for loan companies. While
away Mr. Henderson visited A. Bert-
schi, a pioneer of the community who
recently returned from a transconti
nental tour in hia automobile.
"We weie down in a Texaa town.'
savs Mr. Bertschi. "when we decided
to make a purchase or apples, waj
stooped at a grocery store. 'Now
we ve got two kinas oi appies,- aaia
the grocer, one of which will cost you
30 cents per desen and the other 50
cents. The 30 cent apples are fair.
They are grown up in Colorado. The
others are the best apples I ever saw
They come from Hood River. That's

SCHOOL FAIR
WASSUCCESS
EXHIBITS WERE MANY AND VARIED
Tables oi First Floor of K. of P. Build
ing Loaded With Vegetables, Pastry
and Needlework
The Fifth Annual Hood River County
Industrial School Fair waa brought to
successful close Saturday night.
With the annual stock show called off
because of apple growers being too
busily engaged in their pre-barvest
work to prepare exbibita and no plana
made for an apple fair here, the
children's exhibits, which will form
the chief attraction of its kind for the
year in Hood River, had the support of
the entire county. Accompanied by
proud parents, diminutive exhibitors
were here Saturday from practically
every school district in the county, and
the lists of displays were numerous
and varied.
"The results at the School Fair have
been very gratifying," declares County
School Superintendent Gibson, who had
charge of the preparations and the
fair, itself, "and the interest displayed
shows a healthy co-operation between
teachers, parents and pupils through
out tba county. A large number of
exbibita would win merit at a fair of
adult farmers."
Attendance at the fair, the exhibits
of which filled the first story rooms of
the Knights of Pythias hall, was
heavy. Local business men, whose
subscription to the fair fund aa pro
vided by state law made possible a
more acceptable premium list, showed
a keen interest The agricultural dis
play won marked attention. Tablea
were heaped with fine specimens of
different varietiea of potatoes, and the
corn exhibits evidenced an increasing
interest throughout the orchard district
in that cereal. Hundreds of cakes,
loaves of bread and pies bore mute
testimony to the earnest work during
the past several days of future Valley
housewives. The center of the large
was filled with an appealing dis
play of wild flowers.
On of the most novel displaya was
that composed of basket work done by
the primary students of the schools of
the East Barrett district.
The contests were judged by Prof.
H. C Seymour and Miss Helen Cow-
gill, both members of the faculty of
