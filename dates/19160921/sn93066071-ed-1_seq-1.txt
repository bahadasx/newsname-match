BONUS OUGHT TO BE EASY TO GET
No move will'be made by the rail
road committe of thelChamber of Com
merce toward raising the 1100,000 bonus
for the northwest railroad until the
chamber directors approve the action
taken by the committee last week. At
that time the committee expressed
itself as favoring the bonus, together
with a right-of-way through Oklahoma
county and terminal sites here. A
directors' meeting will be field Thurs
day.
"While the amount asked is large, I
think there will be little (trouble in
getlnig it," said President VaughU
"The road means much to Oklahoma
City, -end there are undoubtedly
enough men interested in the increased
trade it would bring from the north
wesfpart of the'state to subscribe the
bonus within a short time.".
An expression of opinion on the
subject was given by the entire cham
ber during the re-organization cam
paign. A questional sent out to all
membera asking for suggestions as to
the thing Oklahoma City needs worst
resulted in three fourths of the mem
bers answering that a northwest rati
load is tne thing that should be scour
ed first Oklahoman.

RAILROADS NEEB COOPERATION
Development Work Being Halted on
Account of Inadequate Facilities.
i
j - i
HARRY D. TR.VAX, Hardware
The fact that the railroads are fall
ing, behind the needsvdf the country
was pointed out recently in a most im
pressive way by Mr. Howard Elliot,
president of the New York, -New Ha
ven and Hartford lines, In an address
before the Railway Development asso
ciation, who said In part:
"The development work today in
which you and all others in the United
States are Interented is being halted
because the plants ot the railroads
eannot produce enough transportation
for tho needs of the people. The same
thing is true of many other manufac
turing and industrial plants. In these
cases, however, the country does not
condemn the manufacturer, but on the
contrary, its policy has been to
help them so that they may increase
their plaus and Increase their produc
tivity. "Unfortunately, the same policy has
not been pursued toward transporta
tion business, and now these plants, ae
I have already stated, are not large
enough to manufacture day by day
the safe and adequate transportation
that is so necessary for all other forms
of business. Railroad owners and
railroad managers have made errors,
and unfortunately these errors have
been magnified by thote who either
cannot, or do not Bee that the repress
ive and depretslng policy of the last
ten years towards the transportation
business could have but one effect in
the long run, namelf, that of stunting
its growth.
"Some of us in the business have
tried hard to make this clear, and, for
our pains, have been called calamity
howlers and pessimists. Instead, what
we have been trying to do was to have
a reasonable margin in the transporta
tion business bo that the plants could
be added to constantly and be ready to
serve the people ,,w hen the psak load
ca'me'. The'bwners'and managers are'
in the position ot trying to serve 100,
000,000 people, to treat fairly Marly
2,000,000 employees, to respond to the
conflicting rules, regulations and de
mands of forty-eight sovereign states
and the Interstate Comrncr e Commis
sion, '
"Meantime, the country has been
growing fast, and the result has been
a diversion of energy into channels
that were not productive for the coun
try as a whole; and the railroads have
not been able to do the best they
could to prepare for ''an increasing
volume of business. So, today, the
country is face-to-face with inadequate
facilities, and there should be good
temper and co-operation by all to do
the work required and to bring the
transportation plants up to the present
needs and to have a safe margin for
future demands." 9-21-lt.
BROOMCORN $140.00
Considerable broom corn has been
coming to market this week for which
the farmers have been receiving f 140.00
per ton. While the crop is not as large
as in some years past yet, considerable
brush was raised here and there and
the good prices which are prevailing
makes up for the shortage in the crop.
Taken all together Beaver county
farmers huve not done half bad the
past season. Even though crops were
short, the prices have been so good
that it made up to a great extent the
shortage. During the past season the
writer haB visited most of the central
section ot the United States and as far
west ub the Pacific coast and we feel
that we are not exaggerating when we
say that outside of the irrigated sec
tione which we visited, ve found no
place where tho crops wure better or
we. might say -as good, as they are right
here at home. Beaver county has In
deed done herself proud tho past tew
seasons' and our farraeru are about the
most fortunate of any we know of Just
now. Stay with your Beaver county
homestead, You can't beat it.
Wo are glad to be able, to report an
improvement in the condition of "Dad"
Mansfield who has been seriously ill of
typhoid but Is now on tho road to ro
covery.
