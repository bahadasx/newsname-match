There is no better Investment for an
em ployee or an employer, and cer
tainly nothing else so satisfactory to
the public.
"Honesty" not alone in your fin
ances, but in every effort or endeav
or. Be honest with yourself.
Your unfaltering interest In Safe
ty First Is earnestly urged. In the

George Mollrinv's borne .Vaj.ir did
not hesitate to keep in the race at
the Chadron fair after ills driver had
been thrown from the cart and the
sulky disabled by tlx.- crushing of one
of the wh-'els.
Mr. Mollrlng was driving. A Chad
ron horse was leading in the nrsi
quarter of the free-for-all. The
leader over-reached and fell. The
driver of Major tried to swerve to
one side and eprnpe the almost cer
tain wreckage th.it a collision would
cause but It was too late and one
wheel of the cart crashed into the
unturned sulky. Mr. Mollring whs
thrown but not Injured. On- wheel
of the cart was out of commisHion.
Major took in the situation quickly.
Other horses were coming along and
there was no time to lose. So M ijor
started in to win the race without a
driver and accomplished the object
I with apparent ease. He went past
the grandstand at a wonderful pace,
the crowd hardly comprehending
whether he was In the race or Just
"going some." But Major kntw

on the course. On the home stretch
he came along like lightning a full
length in the lead when h cross. -d

the county commissioners held last
Friday and Saturday, three now
highways were laid out and work on
the construction of the same will be
gin at once.

lngford and along the Burlington
right of way. This entailed a dam
ago allowed by the appraisers of $ 1,-
430, but the owners of the land trav
ersed by the new road filed claims
for an amount greatly In excess of
this.
The second road Is near Canton,
and extends from there to the Win-
ton place, a distance of eight miles,
at an appraised damage of $65.
The other road will extend from
one mile north of the Keegan ranch
