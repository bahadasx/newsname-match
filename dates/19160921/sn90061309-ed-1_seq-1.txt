GRACE BAPTIST
We all felt very comfortable in
our clean house Sunday The
usual crowd was in attendance.
The subject of the morning dis
course was "Our Hiding Place."
The text used is to be found in 32
chapter Isaiah 2 verse. "And a
man shall be as an hiding place
from the wind and a covert from
the tempest," etc. We pointed
out the truth that, though we may
be optimists yet We must acknowl
edge that life as we know it has its
desert like aspects and is subject
to its tempests Further God has
blessed some men by m iking them
as hiding places for their fellows
This was true of Kings like David:
Prophets like Samuul aud Elijah;
of law givers like Muses; of the
worlds greatest men. Again men
have become a hiding place to
their fellows by manifesting a spirit
of sympathetic helpfulness by
answering the heart call of the
folks gSH&vt him aud by getting
their life connected up with that
of Christ, the greatest of all hiding
places. He is indeed the Hiding
Place for the souls of men and he
is man as well as God.
The subject for the night service
as previously announced was "The
Price of Hogs" Text Mark 5 17
Quite a few visitors were present
The usual services next week. A
hearty welcome extended to all.
W. H Johnson, Pastor.
