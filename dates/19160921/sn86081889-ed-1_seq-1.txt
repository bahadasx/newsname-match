McCONNELLSBURG TO TOE FRONT.
Citizen "Civic" Would Take Advantage
of Opportunity to Impress Travel
ers With Our Civilization.
The Lincoln Highway has help
ed to a great extent to put Mc-
Connellsburg on the map. We
live in the midst of one of the
most beautiful mountain regions
through which the Highway pass
es. Tourists passing over the
Tuscarora Summit cannot help
but exclaim over the beautiful
view from the top of the moun
tain. Naturally they would ex
pect a clean up-to-date town that
has the advantage of being sur
rounded by such enviroment
How they are disappointed on
entering our town to see ' almost
every vacant spot marred by a
growth of weeds and a place for
debris to accumulate; buildings
unpainted and unkept; streets
and crossings in an unsightly con
dition and alleys scarcely pass
able. Have we no pride in our own
home town, the town of which
we should all be proud; can we
not make it a beauty spot, one in
which every stranger will want
to stop a second time?
It is not enough to keep our
own properties in repair and pre
sentable but we should extend
our domestic pride into civic pride
and interest ourselves in our
whole vicinity.
How much better for our chil
dren to grow up in the midst of
beauty than surrounded by slov
enliness. Our lives are influenc
ed to a great extent by our sur
roundings and surely we should
take pride enough to give our
children the very best we can af
ford and cur community can af
ford. We all have our love for the
beautiful, and our love for the
beautiful helps us love the pure
and divine, but we must be train
ed in what is really beautiful.
Each one can contribute his little
to make our environment what
it should be to give us this train
ing. Our Civic Club is yet very
young but even in the short time
it has been organized it has cre
ated an intense interest in com
munity improvements and we
need the cooperation of every citi
zen of the town and vicinity. Let
us help putMcConnellsburg on the
map not merely as a stopping
place for travelers but a town
made beautiful by the interest
and help of its residents.
Contribute something either in
work or funds to bring the town
to the front and make it as Wil
liam Penn said of the city which
he founded, "a fair green country
town such as I delight to see."
CIVIC.
5000 Bushels of Tomatoes.
Robert M. Renfrew,- ex-pro-
thonotary of Franklin county is
now in the midst of packing and
canning a crop of 5,000 bushels
of tomatoes, which he has raised
on eighteen acres of his farm
near the ' South mountain. He
has forty people engaged in the
work and the crop will make six
carloads.
Mr. Renfrew is demonstrating
beyond doubt that it is not nec
essary to go south to raise toma
toes, and establish a profitable
canning business. The soil, cli
mate, and other conditions make
Fulton county an attractive place
for just such enterprises; and
with the completion of the rail
road to McConnellsburg, the
question of marketing the pro
duct will be solved.
Dickson Porger.
At the Smithfield Street M. E.
church, on Wednesday, August
30, 1916, Rev. J. T. Pender, unit
ed in marriage Mr. Emmert R.
Dickson, formerly of Philadelphia
and Miss Lela Porger, of Two
Harbors, Minn.

Taylor township, were guests in

An Appeal to Town Council.
Again has the News been re
quested to act as mouthpiece for
an indignant public. This time
the complaint is against the use
less, diabolical noises made by
leaving open the cut-out in auto
mobiles while they are being
driven through our streets. An
other Bource of bitter complaint
is the testing and speeding of
engines while the machines are
standing along our curbs. No
conversation nor business trans
action can take place while these
noises are going on. Times with
out number, business men have
to wait for them to cease. The
noise of engine testing has been
kept up for as long as ten min
utes at a time when it wa3 nec-
esssary for somebody in the neigh
borhood to converse, and the cut
out nuisance seems to be chronic
with some drivers.
There is scarcely a day that
the speed limit within the Bor
ough is not violated, and this i3
more frequently done by our peo
ple than by Btrangers. If the
speed stunt and the cut-out rack
et were practiced in Lh ambers
burg it would cost just $12.50 for
each and every performance.
Our Town Council is expected to
see that the citizens of the Bor
ough have conferred official hon
or upon them. Then, Gentlemen
get busy. Don't wait until alter
the funeral of some child run
down by a reckless driver.
Autos ColliJ;.
Last Saturday afternoon, a
Dodge car from Pittsburgh was
descending Sideling Hill, and at
Lady's Turn, the driver either
Blowed down or stopped to in
quire of Rush Cline the. way to
some point south of Saluvia. Just
then a Ford from Pittsburgh
dashed into the rear of the Dodge
and both cars were damaged.
While the cars were being repair
ed in McConnellsburg, the Ford
driver sued the Dodge driver be
fore Justice Peightel, who gave
judgment for costs six dollars
and two dollars and fifty cents
damage. We are of the opinion
that the best part of the whole
affair is that at least two drivers
will use their brains next time
they drive over a steep, winding
road.

The Ladies Did The Work.
Europe is not the only place
where women have taken the
place of men in the fields. Right
here in McConnellsburg the la
dies of the several churches, tired
of waiting for the work to be
done through other channels, got
together recently and cleaned up
the churchyards of the town.
They managed to secure a little
help where the use of the scythe
was necessary, but in many in
stances, the growing rubbish was
cut away by means of sickles,
butcher knives and shears. And
where hoes, rakes, lawn mowers
and, wheelbarrow were necessa
ry, the ladies did not hesitate a
moment to blister their hands in
the manipulation of these instru
ments. Some of them gave a
day and a half to the work out
in the hot sun. We want all the
world to know that the ladies of
McConnellsburg "are too proud
to fight" with the other sex when
it comes to a matter of choice be
tween letting the last resting
places of our friends grow up in
the disgraceful manner recently
indicated, or whether they will
put their Lords off with ' a cold
dinner for a day or two while
they remedy the grievance inde
pendently of stomachs. We have
not heard, nor do we expect to
to hear, of any "stomach trou
bles" due to foregoing reasons.
All honor to ladies of McConnells
burg. After the blisters heal,
they will be found again superin
tending the affairs in homes of
refinement and culture, where
weeds of a far different nature
are never for a moment permit
ted to find lodgment in the fami
ly circle.
From away out in Santa Rosa,
California, came a dollar post of
fice order a few days ago, from
Mrs. R. A. Hockinsmith to pay
her subscription to July 1917.
Wq are expecting our first frost
for this fall, while out where
Mrs. Hockensmith lives they are
getting ready for a pleasant sea
son of mild weather.
Miss Sallie Reeder, of Altoona,
was a i ecent guest of Mrs. Net
tie Trufcx for several days.
Opcu Sheds for Sheep.
Sheep sheds mav combine effi
ciency and economy. The Penn
sylvania State College has dem
onstrated that sheep wintered
in an open shed having a south
ern exposure, free from draughts
and affording a dry bed, are in
better physical condition than
wintered in a warm, ill-ventilated
barn basement. During the
lambing season, of course warm
er quarters are necessary. Ewes
may then be removed to warmer
quarters and later replaced in
the shed. After lambs are three
dayB old they will not suffer in
the open sheds, even during zero
weather.
The shed used to house experi
mental ewes and lambs at State
College adjoins the south side of
a hay shed. The sheep shed is
60 feet long and 30 feet wide and
cost $200. Its capacity is 100
mature sheep. It was built of
hemlock lumber over a super
structure of oak posts. The roof
and west end are covered with
tar paper. An alley six feet wide
runs the full length of the inner
side of shed. The hay shed at
tached affords a place for storage
of feed and lambing pens.
The shed is divided into seven
pens for experimental purposes
Three lots instead of seven can
probably be more desirable un
der average farm conditions. Un
der Buch conditions, also, breed
ing sheep in winter quarters
should be divided into groups
with reference to age and condi
tion. Breeding sheep should be
separated from fattening sheep.
An exercise yard thirty-two feet
wide adjoins each pen. They
should be well drained and dry.
The Governor's Visit
Next Tuesday afternoon, Sep
tember 2Gth, between three and
four o'clock, Governor Martin G.
Brumbaugh accompanied by rep
resentatives of the Agricultural
Department, and the State High
way Department, expect to visit
McConnellsburg and Webster
Mills. The object of the visit, as
given but some time ago, is to
collect information concerning
agricultural needs and conditions
in the State. For this reason,
the party was asked by the peo
ple of Fulton county to tarry a
little longer inside our borders
than was at first intended, and
the trip to Webster Mills result
ed. It now remains for the Cove
people to point out to these men
local needs and conditions if we
are to have our share of what
may be recommended for future
legislation in the State. Every
farmer in the County is request
ed to hear what the Governor
may have to say in his ten-minute
talks at McConnellsburg and
at Webster Mills.
Important Decision.
An important decision handed
down in Common Pleas Court at
Pittsburgh, Pa., by Judge Davis,
holds that the State is not re
sponsible for accidents arising
out of negligence on the part of
employees of the State Highway
Department in not keeping state
roads in proper condition.
At the last Legislature a num
ber of enabling acts were passed
permitting individuals who suf
fered such personal injuries to
bring actions against the Com
monwealth to recover damages;
but the Court has held that even
in these cases the actions cannot
be maintained.
The question was decided in a
suit filed by William G. Dietrich,
of Indiana township, who was
authorized by an act passed June
8, 1915, to bring suit against the
Commonwealth to recover any
damages due him from injuries
suffered while driving along a
State highway in the county.
Fernando Decker, of Lickirtg
Creek township, has a six-acre
field of Silver Hull buckwheat
that averages three feet high,
but much of it stands five and a
half feet The hot sun did not
affect it and it is well filled.
YOUR HAIL
Little Talks on Health and Djgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, H. DM LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Do you read your morning mail
at the breakfast table? Have
you ever used a knife or fork to
open your letters? It is not an
uncommon practice and yet an
uncleanly and dangerous one.
The post-office is essentially a
public utility and it is universally
used by all classes of people. A
common point of destination may
put my lady's dainty note beside
a dirty scrawl from the viles of
slums.
Millions of pieces of mail mat
ter are handled. A certain num
ber of these come from people
who are suffering from all kinds
of diseases, some of them loath
some and infectious.
Stamps and envelopes, contra
ry to hygienic rules are for con
venience sake frequently licked.
Despite quarantine precautions
mail sometimes comes from the
houses where cases of communi
cable disease exists which have
not been reported.
Mail bags are not subjected to
regular disinfection, and are not
so cleansed as to make them safe
from the danger of becoming a
factor in the transmission of dis
ease.
During the recent epidemic of
infantile paralysis many of those
working on the disease formed
the opinion that it may be car
ried by a third person. It is not
unreasonable to presume that the
disease may be carried through
the mail.
Alfalfa.
BY B. W. TRUAX, D. V. M.
Burr Oak, Kans., Sept. 16. It
is with much gratification that I
note the interest being manifest
ed in my county, concerning the
production of one of the most
prolific, as well as nutritious of
our hay crops.
Being located in what is known
to be one of the principal alfalfa
growing regions of the country,
I am in position to know its limi
tations and possibilities. Thou
sands of bushels of seed are pro
duced in my vicinity, and the hay
is one of the main reliances of
the region. However, alfalfa,
like anything else of value, is not
strictly of unalloyed perfection
as a feed, and I wish to acquaint
those, who are unfamiliar with
its feeding qualities, of two dan
gers in connection with its use.
First; Under no consideration
must cattle be permitted to graze
upon the green alfalfa, as it very
often results in fatal bloating;
but the well cured alfalfa hay,
when fed judiciously, never af
fects cattle seriously in this man
ner. Second: An exclusive diet of
roughage in the form of alfalfa
is just as preposterous as substi
tuting an exclusive diet of cake
for bread by human beings, es
both are too nutritious. Alfalfa
should never form more than one
third of the roughage consumed
by stock of any kind. Access to
all the alfalfa hay which an ani
mal can cousume, is very liable
to result indigestive and other
systemic disorders of the animal
organism. Keeping these two
disadvantages in mind it is prob
able that no other crop would
prove more profitable than a
small yield of alfalfa upon Ful
ton County farms.
Tag Day.
Under the auspices of the Civ
ic Club.McConnellsburgistohave
its first Tag Day October 4th.
The purpose is that every man
woman and child will wear a tag
not an "automobile tag" but a
neat tag that the wearer may
show his or her hearty approval
of this worthy work. The tags
will be Bold by a number of our
young ladies. The price what
you choose to give. The proceeds
to be used for the improvement
of our town.
