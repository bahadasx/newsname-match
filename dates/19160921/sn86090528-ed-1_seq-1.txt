FIRST AID
TO INJURED
EXPLAINED
Dr. Eric S. Green, who is in charge
of Red Cross Car No. 1 , and is making
a trip over the Rock Island lines ror
the purpose of instructing employes
and their families in first aid work,
gave two instructive and helpful talk.1
in Chickasha yesterday. In the after
noon he lectured to about 250 men at
tho shops, and In the evening address
ed an Interested gathering in the lec
ture room of the car.
Dr. Green did not handle his sub
jects in a technical manner but simply
and clearly that the laymen might re
ceive the full benefit of his instruc
tions. A part of his talk was telling
the men what not to do as well as!
what to do. In taking up the treat
ment of wounds and the methods of
controlling bleeding he was as explicit
in his instructions not to wash out the
wounds with water or to put unclean
hands to the wounds, as he was in his
direction for the proper application of
first aid bandages. Also he told of the
numerous articles such as matches,
tooth picks and points of pen knives
which should not be used in removing
cinders from tho eye.
The treatment of burns and frac
tures and how to put on splints was
shown, and artificial respiration waa
demonstrated. The proper aid for
sunstroke or fainting was an Interest
ing part of the lecture and stress was
laid on the correct methods of carry:
ing the injured.
The lectures were made plain by
practical demonstrations. Dr. Grean
asking several men from among his
hearers to assist him. The lectures
lasted only an hour and Dr. Green cov
ered each topic fully instead of trying
to talk on too many subjects. Con
cluding hist advice Dr. Green explain
ed that the purpose of first aid it
treatment was just what the name im
plied and was only to be used until the
patient could be turned over to a phy
sician. Its object was to keep the in
jured man in the best possible shape
until professional help could be oh
taiued.

San Francisco, Sept. 21. The name
of President Wilson was injected to
day into the siaie prohibition fight
througn tne campaign for J. Frank
Hanloy and Dr. Ira Kandrith, prohibi
tion candidates for president and vice
president. Oliver Stuart, national
campaign manager, of the prohibition
ists, telegraphed President Wilson
asking him if the wets were repre

Hanley today scored Hughes for his
silence on the liquor question.
CARE IN PICKING AND
UNUSUALLY
Washington, D. C, Sept. 21. Cotton
growers now have one of the best op
portunities of many years to profit by
increased care In handling their cot
ton, according to cotton growing and
marketing specialists of the U. S. de
partment of agriculture.
Care in pic-king, aHsmbling anJ
hauling seed cotton, and in glutting,
as well as in the handling of the bales,
may result in raising the selling valuo
of the fiber materially. This is true
every year. During the present sea
son, however, the restricted crop and
limited supplies ut tho mills, coupled
with tlio steady demand, have sent
prices to high levels, making the in
crease in returns to the grower for
cach. higher grade proportionately
greater. The advantages in receiving
the highest possible grade are so ob
vious under the present favorable mar
keting conditions, that many fa'iners
no doubt will adopt tho more careful
methods which make the higher val
ues possible.
Ordinarily the matter of grades does
not receive nearly enough attention.
As a result, farmers lot several mil
lion dollars annually. This loss would
be proportionately frr-ater under th.T
hiKh ruling prices this year if there
were no improvement in handling
practices. In I'M 1 the average price
of middling was .:, cents; in 191-',
12 2J cents; in 1!11, 13.43 cental in
1!14. 7.M cents; and in l:15, 11 V
cents. Middling is no selling around

HANDLING COTTON
PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
The following suggestions for prac
tices which will tend to raiso cotton
grades are made by the cotton mar
keting specialists of the U. S. depart
ment of agriculture:
Don't pick cotton before it Is matur
ed. This will Insure stronger fiber.
Pick carefully to avoid mixing the
leaves and trash in your seed cotton.
Don't store the seed cotton on the
ground. Such precautions will help
to keep the lint clean and white.
Don't have cotton ginned until it is
thoroughly dry. Ginning while the
cotton is wet produces a rough, nap
py lint which causes great waste in
spinning. Such cotton .therefore, will
not bring the best prices.
When practicable have tho gir.ner
run his niachineery slowly enough to
produce an even, smooth lint, and pay
willingly a slightly increased fee.
Protect jour baled cotton carefully
from dust, smoke and moisture,
whether hauling it to market or stor
ing it on the farm or elsewhere.
It also pays to handle and store cot
ton seed carefully. ThH product is
easily damaged it stored on the
ground, permitted get wet. or other
wise carelessly handled. Cottou seed
is now selling at high prices and the
farmer, therefore will profit by keep
ing it in suc h condition that it will top
tne market. It will also pay bira to
keep the seed in good condition for
planting. Whereas cotton seed so'.d
for $17.10 a ton in 1911. it was bring
ing V ,22 a tn in August. m
