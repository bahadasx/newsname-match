Strikers and Sympathizers in
New York Engage Police in
Running Fight.
DYNAMITE PLOT
IS FRUSTRATED
Hope of Averting Walkout of
700,000 Union Workers
Diminishes.
New York, Sept. 20—Rioting was
renewed here tonight in connection
with the car strike after efforts of
Mayor Mitchell and others had fair
ed during the day to effect a settle'
ment of the differences. Several hun
dred strikers and their sympathizers
attacked four surface cars and en
gaged in a running fight with police
reserves. Many arrests were made.
Conspiracy Frustrated.
What the police characterized as
conspiracy to use dynamite in the
etrike was frustrated by the arrest
of a man, who asserted he was a
striking motorman. The prisoner is
alleged to have declared he had sought
explosives to "blow up" a couple of
Broadway cars.
When Police Commissioner Woods
was told today that six-year-old Louis
Rodelli was dying a victim of a brick
hurler he redoubled his efforts to
clear roofs along the traction lines
and went into conference with Dis­
trict Attorney Swann to provide for
the speedy punishment of such of­
fenders.
Big Strike Seems Nearer.
Hope of averting the threatened
strike of 700,000 union workers here
in sympathy with the car men was
diminished.
Apparently the only chance now of
calling off the union officials in their
determination "to tie up New York"
by Monday next, it was said tonight,
lies in a conference to be held to­
morrow between a Citizen's Commit­
tee and the strike leaders.
Approximately 10,000 women, wives
of the striking carmen ~and members
of the trade unions, will act as pick*
ets beginning tomorrow, it was an­
nounced tonight.

American Red Cross Spent $600,

Washington, Sept. 20—Nearly a
million people have been made home­
less by one of the greatest Hoods on
record in that section of China where
the American Red Cross already has
spent $(00,000 for Hood protection
and where the $30,000,0011 loan for
reclamation work, which was post­
poned by the war, was to have been
Bpent. Reports to the state depart­
ment today from the American coun­
sel at Manking said the Hwai river
ha3 inundated an area of about 7,000
square miles in Anhui, province. Ap­
peals for aid have been sent out for
the homeless, who virtually are en­
tirely dependent on charity aB all the

The flood occurred in a flat, a sec­
tion where the North to South pas­
sage of the Grand Canal had dammed
'up a large lake and allowed the Hwai
river to too little space to carry out

there probably has been little im­

CASE ASSUMES AN
INTERESTING ANGLE
Sioux Falls, S. D., Sept. 20.—A pe
tition was filed today in the United
States district court by an attorney
for the Wells-Fargo and American
Express companies, seeking to enjoin
the South Dakota attorney general
and the state railway commission
from proceeding in the hearing in the
action started by the attorney gen
oral in the state supreme court, which
issued an order to show cause why
an injunction should not be granted
against putting into effect the new
express rates between points in
South Dakota as ordered by the inter­
state commerce commission.
The action in the state court has
temporarily restrained the express
companies from adopting the new
tariffs, which were to be in effect Sep­
tember 15, until after the hearing in
the supreme court, October 2. A new
twist in the situation has developed
by filing of the petition in the federal
court.
The pending action in the federal
court ol' this district is said to in­
volve the construction of the United
States statute giving authority to af­
fix rates to the interstate commerce
commission.

Secret Service Workers Claim to

Syndicate of Pretty Women
and Handsome Men Who
Trapped and Mulcted Wealthy
Persons.
Chicago, Sept. 20.—Federal secret
service men claimed today that as
a result of the arrest of five men and
three women here they will break
up a syndicate composed of beautiful
women and handsome men who have
been operating an amazing blackmail
scheme and secured more than a mil­
lion dollars from wealthy men and
women of society.
It is claimed that evidence unearth­
ed here will lead to location of black
mailers who form a part of the syndi
cate with headquarters in New York
and Philadelphia.
The authorities say the syndicate
is composed of 40 men and 20 women,
who live in the height of luxury, dress
like millionaires and play the parts
of millionaires with success.
In the apartments where arrests
were made here, the secret service
men found many pictures of men and
women in compromising positions.
These pictures, it is said, were to be
used by the blackmailers to force tri­
bute from the persons trapped.
Prices paid for silence on the part
of the blackmailers after 'suckers"
had been trapped, ranged from $5000
to $40,000.

Roumanians Meet With Reverses

London, Sept. 20.—In an effort to
retrieve in part their lost territory,
the Germans Wednesday, despite the
bad weather, made violent counter
attacks against the French over a
three-mile front in the region of the
Priez, France, and Boucbavis, north
of the Somme.
In mass formation the Teutons
threw attack after atta along thjfr
lines from 9 o'clock in the morning
until dark and at the end of the day
the French were everywhere holding
their positions, according to Paris,
and the battlefield at points waa cov­
ered with dead.
Invaders Thrown Back.
During the fighting the Germans
penetrated the village of Bouchaves
nex on the northeastern part, but here
the French met them with hayoneta
and dislodged them. Four assault*
on the Priez, France, in which the
Germans came on in all fury, were
repulsed by the French, whose ob­
servers assert that the Germans at
last withdrew in disorder, leaving
many dead behind them.
On the British front the inclement
weather still holds the opposing fac­
tions to artillery duels.
In the eastern theatre in Russia
and Galicia, both Berlin and Vienna
report the repulse of heavy Russian
attacks in the Lusk sector and south­
east of Lemberg.
Local successes for the RusKians in
the Caucasian are conceded *by the
Teutonic Allies, who say however,
that on the whole the Dussian at­
tacks in this region were repulsed.
Roumanians Met Reverses.
Down in Transylvania, where the
Roumanians have been fighting
against the Austro-Hungariana, the
invaders apparently have met with
a serious reverse in the region Hats*
zeg, where they have been driven
back by the Teutonic Allies to the
Petroseny and the Szurduk Pass,
through which they entered Transyl­
vania in this region, recaptured from
them.
Bulgars Make Gain.
In Bobidija, where the Russians
and Roumanians have been heavily
reinforced along the lines of the Con
stanza railway from the Black Sea
to the Danube, the tide of the battle
is fluctuating. Sofia reports successes
for the arms of the Bulgars at cer­
tain points while Paris claims a vic­
tory for the Roumanians near Enigea.
Violent Combat in Progress.
The western end of the Macedoni­
an front is still the scene of violent
combat.
Berlin reports that the Germans,
who are co-operating with the Bul­
gars, have repulsed Entente thrusts
near Fiorina, Greece. Rome admits
that the Italians in the southern slope
of Mbnte Beles have been driven
back by the Bulgarians.

for the Ottoman forces over the Rus­
sians and British, respectively, in
Persia and along the Tigris.
