Will Vote on Sending
Men of Island to War
MELBOURNE, Sept. 21. -Wives and mothers of Australia
will go to the polls within a few weeks to decide whether or not
they shall send their husbands and sons to war.
It Is probably the first time In the history of the world that
the women of any large, country have been permitted to make such
a choice.
The House of .Representatives, by a vote of 47 to 12, today
passed a bill calling for a referendum on the question of conscrip
tion. It is considered certain that the bill will pass the Senate!
Women's votes probably will decide whether the conscription
measure, strongly advocated by Premier Hughes, will be approved
at the referendum. It is the general belief that It wiU.
Thousands of women with relatives already at the front are.
certain to vote their approval.
HUB

OF INDIA'S VOTE
SETS RAPID
PACE
Opens Whirlwind Campaign
With Twelve Speeches on
Schedule for Today.
By PERRY ARNOLD.
LAFAYETTE, Ind., Bept H. Nomi
nee Hughes started pursuit of Indiana's
electoral .votes today In the most
"whlrlwlndy" campaign trip the
Hoosler 8tate has ever witnessed from
a Presidential candidate.
For the next three days Hughes will
criss-cross the State, preaching the doc
trine of a Republican tariff for pro
tection and assailing the Democrats for
failure to keep their promises.
Today he bad schedulod no less' than
twelve speeches in various cities, wind
ing up tou ght at Richmond.
Tomorrow thirteen Indiana' towns will
hear him, and on Saturday seven.
Then Mr. and Mrs. Hughes -wilt have
a day of rest over Sunday at Indianapo

cratic tariff and' business record.
Divides Talk.
'He has found It Impossible to cover
all the ground of his assault on the
(Wilson Administration In short speeches
such aa he muat make In most of the
cities on his schedule during the next
few days, so he plana to subdivide his
talk discussing the tariff In one place,
labor in another. Mexico, business legis
lation, etc.
Indiana audiences may expect further
and stronger references to the Wilson
Administration's course In the matter of
Interferences by the British with Ameri
can malls.
Hughes Invariably follows the same
course In developing his attack on those
hp takes great pains to explain are
"friends and fellow-Americans" on the
other aide of the political battle. That
course is first to let drop Just a hint
H"1" J beomes one of his main
"punches."
.Jn Wisconsin .yesterday ! dropped
that hint early in the day very
much veiled but before he left the
State he had expanded it mo that the
attack was unmistakable. Those In
his party expect him to come out
even more vigorously In Indiana on
this, and on the question of "Ameri
canism." under which head the Re
publican nominee refers to hyphen
Ism. No Personal Issues.
One other thin which was devel
oped in the Governor's speeches to
day at Monon and here was the way
In which he Is taking the sting out
of his criticisms of the Democrats by
disclaiming- any personal Issues and
lauding them as sincere in their aim.
"When I uv 'our nnnnnitnti " fi
said In one speech, "I mean our
friends, because we are not aeekincr
to impose anytnino; upon uie Ameri
can people for the benefit of anv set
of men. We are not a sectional
party. What la o-ood for Renuhllcan

business. It la for America we are
working, and the point Is. what la

The meeting at Milwaukee laat
night waa the biggest the candidate
has had at any time In his campaign

It was the Uargeet audience assem

naa ever appeared.

LONDON, Sept. XI. German propa
gandists are attempting to atlr up bad
feeling between the United Statea and
Great Britain by the circulation ot false
charges regarding the British censor
ship, the British foreign office declared
In a statement to the United Press
today. ,
"The German wireless newa agency.
Indeed the whole system of German
propaganda, loses no opportunity of en
deavoring to create Ill-feeling between
Great Britain and her friends," said
the foreign office.
"When the facta cannot be ao distort
ed aa to serve the German purpose, no
scruples stand In the way of .deliberate
mendacity.
"A recent wireless message stated
that veterans of the American civil
war. residing In Germany, had failed to
.receive their pensions for several
months, alleging that they had been ab
stracted by the British censors.
"The statement that they did not
receive their pension may or may not be
true. It the former, tho American au
thorities will doubtless take the mat
ter up without German prompting.
"The alienation that British censors
confiscated moneys Intended for such
persons is wholly false. It -cannot be
stated too emphatically that notwith
standing the contraband proclamations
and efforts made to Intercept funds en
route to Germany for war loan or other
purposes, his majesty's govesxnent has
given strict Instructions that 'no re
mittances from the United Rtates to
either, Germany or Austria, shall be

tively ainrms mac no remittances ac
companied by evidence that they are
pensions or payments ot other kind In
