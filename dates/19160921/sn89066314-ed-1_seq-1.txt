IAS IDEA TO BETTER
FACTORY
W. H. Braselton, Hamilton-
Brown Manager, Would
Eliminate the Unfit.
TALKS AT LUNCHEON
Students to Be Employed
Where Possible and Profit
able, He Says.
To bring to Columbia a better class
of citizens than in the past as factory
workers will be one of the chief alms
of the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Factory
under the new administration, accord
ing to Walter H. Braselton, the new
superintendent of the factory, in a
talk today at the weekly luncheon of
the Commercial Club.
"We realize," said Mr. Braselton,
"that the type of workers in our fac
tory In the past has not been of the
best sort for better citizenship, but
from now on only persons of good
character will be employed in the fac
tory here. We will also do away with
'hanger-on' workers by only keeping
enough men to fill all jobs. In the
past, three men would work on a
piece that one man does now. This
enables one to make more. All va
cancies will be filled by Columbia
workers."
In his address Mr. Braselton spoke
of the Missourian reporter who came
to see him in regard to the rumor that
the factory would not employ any
more students. "The rumor Is un
founded," said the new superinten
dent. "There isn't a man In this
world who Is more in sympathy with
the man who is seeking an education
than myself. I had to work for all
the education I ever received. But in
fairness to the Hamilton-Brown Shoe
Factory and as the guardian of their
welfare, I must get full value for ev
ery dollar spent. We will employ
student labor as long as we get full
alue. We are not antagonistic to
student labor as long as we get full
sen ice rendered for money received."
Mr. Braselton also discussed hon
esty and success in business. "The
Greeks In the olden days believed
stcalirig was all right until you were
caught. If you were caught, then it
was a disgrace," he said, "and even
today some business men belice the
same thing. They think stealing Is
all right until they arc caught"
The speaker said that the wealthy
man is not the successful man. He
named two or three railroads that he
said were headed by men who obtain
ed their wealth from the laboring
classes and have stolen the insurance
money of widows. I do not call these
men at the head of such companies
successful men," said the superinten
dent. "I would hate to give my chil
dren that kind of moneyi
"Some persons believe that one
cannot be honest and succeed. This is
a false impression. Most of the fail
ures of honest men are not because
they are honest but because they are
Incompetent I advise all college
graduates who expect to go into busi
ness first to get a training under some
seasoned business man before ventur
ing out for themselves.
"The successful man Is the man who
can look back on his past and say,
'I did my best I tried to be fair In
all my actions and dealings.' "
Mr. Braselton said that he was glad
to come tq Columbia because it had
no saloons. He said that he is op
posed to the drinking of liquor and
would try to influence his workers to
think the same.

other distinguished schools, now has
two or more officers of the United
States Army for its work in military
science. With the addition to the
armv made bv the nassing of thei
National Defense Act, an effort Is be
ing made to educate university men
for service as officers.
Major Castle comes to Missouri
from Douglas, Ariz. He has been In
the service for twenty-two years,
having been graduated from West

In the Spanish-American War, Ma
jor Castle served as aid to General
John Brooks in Porto Rico. When
General Brooks was made provincial
governor of Cuba, Major Castle again
became his aid. He has also spent
five years in the Philippine Islands.
Major Castle's position In the Uni

military science and tactics. He was
on a furlough In Minnesota when

'There Is here an excellent oppor
tunity for training men for officers in
the United States Army," Major Castle
said this morning. "I have had Uni

and have found them satisfactory. As'
West Point graduates only 100 to 150
men yearly and there are to be be
tween 1,500 and 1,600 officers required
for the service within the next five
years, the opportunity offered is ap
parent. We will strive to train the

NONE BETTER THAN' COLUMBIA
Will Garth Back on Visit, Compares
This City With California Towns.
Columbia, according to Will W.
Garth, Is as progressive and just aa
beautiful as any California cities of
the same size that he has visited. Mr.
Garth, who is In the advertising busi
ness in San Francisco, Is here visit
ing his sister, Mrs. James Gordon,
1211 University avenue.
"After a year's absence, Columbia
looks mighty good to me," said Mr.
Garth. "There have been a great
many improvements here within a
year's time. California can boast of
no more progressive cities of the same
size, but as a state, California, is far
ahead of Missouri, especially in the
way of good roads. We have spent 36
million dollars on state highways and
we're going to vote on a 15 million
dollar bond' issue for more roads this
fall."
Mr. Garth said that business con
ditions in San Francisco are not so
good as they arc In the east, due, he
believes, to the trouble caused by va
rious labor unions.
"San Francisco has a civic center
which is the show place of the whole
city," he said, "and Columbia could
have one just as well. This civic cen
ter is a park about two blocks square
around which are grouped the various
municipal buildings, the auditorium,
the library, and the state building.
Such a civic center could be built here
and I would like to see It done."
Mr. Garth was a student in the Uni
versity in 1897-'98. He is still a fol
lower of athletics here and has a
scrap book which Is filled with clip
pings and pictures concerning M. U.
athletes since 1901. Until last year,
he had not missed a varsity football
game on Rollins Field since 189C
He will return to San Francisco in
about two weeks.
