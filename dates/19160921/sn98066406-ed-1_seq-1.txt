STATEMENT BY CON-
GRESSMAN CRAMTON
About the New Widow's Pension
Law.
To the Kditori
Through your courtesy I would like
to call attention of widows of Civil
War soldiers to the new pension Jaw
which has just taken effect, the so-called
Asiibrook Law.
This law wiil benefit the following
classes of widows of Civil War soldiers'
1. Any widow heretofore entitled to
912 will be given an increase to $20 if
6he married the soldier prior to his
military service.
2. Any widow heretofore entitled to
812 will be given an increase to $20 if
she is 70 years old or over.
3. Any widow who was the widow
of a boldier and later remarried and
has again been widowed either by di
vorce on her application without her
fault, or by death, can now secure a
per.pian.
4. Any widow uf Civil War soldier,
who married t.uch soldier prior to June
27, 19 5, can now secure a pension.
The limitation formerly was .Iuno(27,
189, but has now been changed to
June 27, 1903.
Any widow who thinks 6he will be
benefitted by any of the provisions of
the law, if she w ill write me at Lapeer
and elate the facts of her case, I will
inform her as to her rights under the
law, furnish her the necessary blank
and look after the matter for her at
the liureau of Pensions. This being
part of my ofticial duties, no charge
will be made to any widow for euch
service, and I wiil be very glad to ren
der it. LOUIS C. CHAM TON,
Congressman, 7th Dist,

While visiting with one of our busi
ness men the first of the week be said,
"why can't Yale have a fair and races
each fall as well as the neighboring
towns? If it isn't possible to have a
regular old fashioned fair, why not get
together and boost for a monster two
or three-day street carnival for 6ome
time during the fall of 1917, to be given
by the business men and citizens of
the city?"
The idea is a good one and should be
pushed to the limit, Years ago, wheu
the place was a lot smaller than it is
now, we had a fair here every year, and
it was a hummer. Let's have a get-to
gether meeting and see if something
of this kind can't be put on. Most of
the old boys of lirockway Center would
buckle into a proposition of this kind
with a winning spirit. Let's try and
see if the new generation can't do as
well as the'old.
Our columns are open for the dis
cussion of this subject, and ye would
like to have the opinion of any of our
citizens whether they favor the propo
sition or not. We want to do anything
we can to make Yale the best little
city in the Thumb and a good town to
live in. How about it, neighbor y
Another thiug that helps to adver.
tice a town, and for which Yale an
nually spends quite a few dollars, is a
good band. Surely a town our size has
plenty of material, and with the long
winter mouths coming on apace, It
seems to us that the time is now ripe
for the organization of a bunch of good
music makers. We believe that the
business men of Ya!e would lend their
support in a financial or any other way,
and that before another summer rolls
around we could have "made-at-home''
music for every holiday.
"The Iron Claw"
Did you ever notice how much more
interesting a motion picture serial is
if you have read the story? Don't you
think you would enjoy the show better
if you could read ou Thursday or Fri
day just what would be pictured on
the screen Saturday night? It makes
you familiar with the scenes and actors
and you always know just what is go
ing to happen.
"The Iron Claw" is one of the most
thrilling motion picture serials ever
written and Cavanagh liros. have se
cured the privilege to run same at
Princess Theatre. An episode of the
story will be screened every Saturday
night. In order that the readers of the
Expositor might familiarize themselves
with the play we have made arrange
ments, at considerable expense, to have
the story appear in our columns. This
week two episodes will appear, as the
story started last Saturday night, but
in the future there will be but one,
and you will be able to keep in touch
with the doings of the different char
ters by reading the Expositor.
The story, which was written by
Arthur Stringer, is one of revengeful
hate with a most ingenious criminal
employing the forces of chemistry and
electricity to help destroy a family
fortune. The wits of master criminals
and equally clever sleuths are matched
in a fascinating manner and the alter
nating victories and defeats produce a
thrilling story.
Don't miss a 'single Installment of
this Interesting story aud after you've
read it go to the Princess Theatre and
see it acted on the screen. If you are not
a subscriber to the Expositor, send in
a dollar for a year's subscription, as
this feature alone Is worth all the pa
per will cost you.
A Bigger, Better Paper
On account of the extra contracted
home and foreign advertising we are
compelled, for a time at least, to Issue
a larger paper. We1 haye been using
from three to seven columns of our
ready-prints each week, but ads that
are sent to Detroit get pied and mixed
up In other ways, and besides this, the
extra ads keep right on coming. Last
week we had to turn down a couple of
nice orders on account of lack of space.
The only way we can figure it out so
as to handle all of our advertising and
at he same time give our readers all
the news is to Issue a twelve-page
paper, which we start this week and
as long as necessary to meet the de
mands of the advertisers.

PKEPAKE THE
CHILDREN FOR
LATER YEARS
'J'HERE is no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Airs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can alFord to
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will 'Willie have to forego his dreams of being a civil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training the ha been
looking forward to? jll they be compelled after school
years' are paaaed to take their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Dank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
comes there will be no necessary "skimping" to start them off right.
