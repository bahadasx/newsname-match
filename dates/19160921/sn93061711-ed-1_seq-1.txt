DEMOCRATS
A WILSON -
CLUB IN
A number of the faithful withered
at the Court House Monday night in
response to an invitation from County
Chairman John Hriseoo, to organize
a Wilson-Marshall Club in Quay coun
ty. "The meeting was called to order
by Chairman Hrihcou anil temporary
chairman and secretary chosen, C. II.
Alldrcdgo and .lames Driscoo. respect
ively. .Mr. Alldrcdgo in a short address
eulogizing President Wilson and (iov.
McDonald told of the splendid achieve
ments and progressive measures chal
lenged by these fearless leaders. He
then told of the purpose of the meeting
and asked for harmony of all factions
in behalf of Democracy. It was then
suggested that he appoint committee
on organization and one on constitu
tion and by-laws, which he did as fol
lows: Constitution and Hy-Lnws D. .J.
Finegnn, Felipe Sanchez y Hnca. and
C. C. Davidson.
Permanent Organization A. E. Dil
lingsly, C. E. Hunter and Ira E. Furr.
These committees will report next
meeting night which will be Monday,
Sept. un.
C. C. Davidson was called upon to
make a speech. He reciprocated by
telling of his experiences while visit
ing in Colorado and other points, from
where he had just returned. He said
he felt very much encouraged at what
ho heard during his trip. Traveling
men who were formerly for Hughes
told him that Wilson was good enough
for them and they found the majority
of the United States of the same opin
ion. He said the majority of the wo
men of Colorado w"c for Wilson, that
he heard from good authority that
the women of California, to gether
with the progressive republicans of
that state, are going to support Mr.
Wilson. He also said that the money
ed interests of the country are going
to put up more coin this year to elect
Hughes than Mark Hanna did to elect
McKinley. That this campaign would
be capital vs labor, or bribery and in
timidation vs. honesty of purpose.
Mr. Davidson said the State cam
paign would lie close and the almighty
dollar would bo very much in evidence.
He believes the Republicans will spend
hundreds of dollars to gain control of
state airairs, that all the requirements
made of men for governor or other of
fices are that they have a big fat poek
etbook and will donate liberally to the
campaign fund. Hrains are not neces
sary. Until recently the older states
were up against this same proposition
in the selection of U. S. senators, but
now since they are chosen by popular
vote the people have a right to choose
a man we may well feel proud of and
A, A. Jones benrs a reputation of be
ing the biggest man in the state.
The purpose of the Wilson-Marshall
Club is to see that every vote in the
county is registered on Nov. 7. A cit
izen who will not use his right of suf
frage is not worthy of being called
an American. He should be ruled with
the rod of iron for a period long
enough to make him appreciate his
privileges and opportunities as an
American citizen.
Senator Caliseh was the next speak
er. He dealt mostly on state and na
tional issues, but plead witli the dem
ocrats to make the Wilson-Marshall
Club worthy of the name, a livo-wiro
organization, working for a total vote
of the county. Don't let any man re
main at home as Wilson's re-election
might be accomplished by only a few
votes from New Mexico.
C. E. Hunter, defeated candidate
for the nomination for probate judge,
addressed the meeting and pledged
his support to those chosen as standard-bearers
of the Democratic party.
He said he was not born a democrat
but acquired his belief through study
and experience. He said he believed
in submission to the majority pro
viding the majority is democratic, lie
was interrogated by Mr. Kilgore, an
other defeated candidate, and he an
swered every question like a profes
sional and sprung comical illustrations
to make his meanings clear.
Felipe Sanchez y Haca, a resident
at present of this county but a voter
in Gnudalupo county, which is normal
ly republican, gave a few illustrations
of how to roll up a big majority for
the .democrats in Quay county. He
said down in his county, if there were
a number of the voters away on a va
cation in the cotton Ileitis of Texas,
or had died recently, the judges of
that precinct were given the right to
vote them for the republican parly
without a written proxy, That if thoy
thought the statu candidates needed a
few more votes thoy had a right to
cast them for them and charge them
ORGANIZE
MARSHALL
TUCUMCARI
to voters who lived in other states
and were to move here within the next
two years. Continuing he said that
Quay county had a right to do the
same thing. If it was right for the re
publicans to vote dead ones, it was
right for the democrats. Mr. Sanchez"
recommendations were somewhnt on
thcjnirlcsqiie order, but he was talk
ing in plain EnglNh and there is no
doubt about some of these methods
being used in districts of solid politi
cal faith.
After taking up matters of minor
importance a motion to adjourn was
in order. The date of the next meet
ing was Vet for next Monday night at
H:()() o'clock when a large crowd Is
expected to be in attendance as mat
ters of importance will be taken up.
IT SURE RAINED
Talk about it rainin' in New Mex
ico, but Monday afternoon about four
o'clock it sure did rain. The main
streets looked like rivers and (Jaynell
street was ii'iout bank full. While it
will not do much good for crops be
cause is only reached a mile or so each
direction from town, it vas sure need
ed on the streets and the recently
Uiaded fair grounds. Now if the nice
weather will remain until the Cow
boys' Roundup, October .', 1, and 5,
Tiicumcari will lie an ideal place to
spend a few days where you can wit
ness wild west stunts performed by
the best men and horses obtainable.
The rain was a welcome visitor Mon
day, now every citizen should prepare
to welcome the big crowd of visitors
that will be here at the Roundup.
3,000 BUSHELS OF
WHEAT MARKETED IN
T LI C 11 M THIS WEEK
Tucumcari is getting to be some
what of a wheat market. Last week
about 11 loads were marketed here
irom uic piains, i.ut mis wook tno to
tal number of loads amounts to 01.
Hotter than three thousand bushels
were sold to the Light Elevator and
the farmers received $-1,300 in cash
for their product. Many of the farm
ers bought new machinery, groceries
and dry goods and a goodly sum was
left in lucumcan.

The price paid for wheat during the
past fJW days was $1.10. Mr. Higday
lias two cars ready for shipment, but
as the market was oil this week the
best olfer he had was $1.10 F. O. H.
Tucumcari. As he paid as high as
$1.15 for some of the wheat he could
not turn it loose at that figure, If the
elevator was finished they could hold
the wheat for the advance price.
CUT YOUR WEEDS
An effort is being made to have ev
ery citizen who believes in civic undo,
to cut his weeds or have .lomo person
cut them before the Roundup. Some
of the wild steers or horses might get
out of the fair grounds and hide in
front of your residence among the
weeds making it dangerous. Don't
wait for frost to loosen the thistles
and turn them loose on your neighbor,
but follow the golden rule, Do unto
others as you would have others do
unto you,' Cleanliness is next to God
liness. Perhaps the city authorities
will find enough money to pay for
grading the streets, which need it
in all parts of town,
DEVELOPMENT OF THE
"STAKED" PLAINS COUNTRY
Ten years ago one could go from
Tucumcari souMi to the cap-rock, dis
tant twenty-live miles along a crooked
trail. Perhaps there were at that
time three small houses to be seen
in the distance. After making the,
ascent of about seven hundred feet 1
in elevation from the valley to the
upper edge of the cap-rock along a
tortuous and steep trail, there open !
before you, far and wide, the PJains I
country.
It was known to all students of
Mitchcl'.s geography as the Staked
Plains. One could drive fifty miles
in almost any direction and not be
able to discern anything on the hori
zon. How truly gratifying it is today
to return to that same locality and
observe vast changes iul materia
wealth and personal comfort.
Highways are opened on section
lines, fenced and traveled. Perhaps
there is not a section of laud in fifty
miles drive that is now without a
tenant or improvements.
There is never an hour that you do
not meet a number of farm wagons
on the road to the market, and auto
mobiles touring to and fro to call on
a neighbor for business or pleasure,
or some one speeding from Doston or
New York to San Francisco.
No one may despair for want of
good water to drink, or for his auto
supplies. There is a wealth of hos
pitality among this people and toward
strangers, which is not dissembled.
In some instances I tarry to note
the equipment on the farm, the num
ber of horses and cattle, and the qual
ity; also the farm machinery, plows,
drills, cultivators, headers, barges,
wheat-binders, corn-binders, etc., and
found in some instances they equalled
the average kept on a North Dakota
farm.
However, they have silos, dipping
vats, reservoirs, and more cattle than
is usually kept on a Dakota farm. Let
me call attention to the eight years
in which the plains country has ac
complished so much. At times they
were threatened with drouth.
In some instances I observe stacks
of feed that have weathered until one
might believe them spoiled. They have
been kept two and three years in re
serve. Should they be required, in
passing through a drouth, they would
only require a small amount of the
exterior to be trimmed off as waste.
I was again reminded of the social
functions given by the northern peo
ple. With their numerous and im
mense groves on every section of land
that are now 25 of HO years old; with
towns and cities within an hours drive;
with High School students throughout
the country and towns, the June fes
tivals are well attended and a good
program rendered each week until
harvest begins. Already the June
festival on the plains attracts crowds
of people. The plains country is grow
ing. I he rural delivery of mail is in
creasing and one observes a group
of mail boxes on the road crossings.
Wherever there is nccess!'y for a pub
lic school they are building a new
house or enlarging the old one to meet
the increasing needs.
There are three central telephone
centers established with which every
house on the plains may soon establish
connection with every other houe,
and thus contribute to personal com
fort.
Here is a point of agreement. In
constructing a new hou.-t on the plains
there is no evidence n either rivalry
or supreme m plan m espenc.
Every house was built on a basis of
economy ami necessity. cry soon
there will be a building boom of mod
em cottages and bungalos. The mater
ial will be stone and cement. The
present owner of the land will be the
owner when the house is finished i-i-if
he dont run for-for office.
I have alluded to roads on the sec-
lion lines, every where on the plains.
I will be pardoned for alluding to Da
kota again. A coulee in that country
signifies a grassy ravine, similar to
the grassy ravine on the plninscotintry
in Quay county, N. M. On every sec
tion line the road is graded, culverts
built at all depressions, anil a small
bridge across the main coulees. The
law requires each owner of land to
mow in the autumn and burn the weeds
on the roadside joining his land. Every
mile of road must be inspected and
where necessary wor'-ed smooth with
a grader.
If a proper accounting of the public
money could be made and published
and the unpaid road bills be paid and
audited, it would inspire confidence to
continue road building in Quay county
wherever roads aie necessary.

Justice McElroy's court was busy
Monday afternoon when a Spanish girl
was brought before the judge to an

Spanish lady during a dance Satur

jealously on the girl's part and the
Judge released her after obtaining the
promise that she would not do it

MRS. I. C. HARNES DIES
Mrs. I. C. Karnes, who was stricken
with paralysis several months ago and
has been an invalid ever since, died
Monday at the family residence near
thc High School.
The remains were shipped to Iowa
where she formerly lived and where
her people now reside. Mr. Dames ac
companied the body and will remain
there a short time before returning
to Tucumcari. He is as yet uundecided
whether ho will remain a resident of
Tucumcnri or not.
Mrs. Darnes is one of thc first ladies
of Tucumcari. She together with her
husband, owned considerable of the
land on which Tucumcari not stands,
and she always liked to live here. She
was stricken with paralysis several
tfmes and partially rallied each timo
but of late she had been confined to
her home and was not strong enough
to be taken out in the auto. Iler hus
band sold the store so that ho could
always bo near her and administer to
her wants, which he did both night
and day until the end came.
Their many friends join the News
in extending sympathy to the bereav
ed husband.

Judge S. II. McElroy was stricken

hopes are now ascertained for hi re
covery. Judge McElroy is held in high es
teem by every citizen of Tucumcari
and it is the sincere desire of all that
lie will fully recover from this severe
attack.
TAX MEETING. SEPT. 28-2'J

In the Hible school life for the rally is
being conducted undor its auspices.
Numerous invitations are being given
to friends of the church nnd a program
committee is faithfully drilling tho
children. The old "admonition" to
"como early" to get a good seat, or,
indeed, any seat at all, is freely given,
so workers themselves must bo nntici-

CONTRACT LET
FOR $41,900.00
TO MR. ROGERS
The contract for the erection of the
school buildings in Tucumcari was let
Inst week to Contractor Rogers of
Texns. His bid was several thousand
, dollars Under the tlOXt loWObt 1111(1 BK
I contractors stiumiucu imis uui mcy
wore $8,000 to $15,000 higher than
Mr. Rogers. He has recently com
pleted buildings in Texas which were
similar to these and feels aure thero
will bo nothing in the way to complete
them within a few months exactly ac
cording to specifications.
Thc schools are crowded to over
flowing with students now and if it
were not for scarcity of houses in the
city, there would hardly be stnnding
room in some of the grades. The real
estate men turn away prospective clt
zens every dny. It is necessary for
them to hunt other towns in which to
live and school their children. This
situation will not continue, long ns
good houses are always in demand and
bring good rents, thus an investment
in cottages, bungalows or modern res
idents will be valuable to those who
have the money with which to make
thc investment.
There is no city anywhere that hns
more desirable building lots for sale.
To the south, east and west there are
lots that can be bought reasonable
enough to allow a person with a small
amount of ensh to build a home. The
Tucumcari Lumber Yard is in n po
sition to sell the lumber on payments
or build the houses and sell the prop
erty on payments. If you have made
up your mind to become a permanent
resident of Tucumcari, why not buy
n lot nnd build a house to suit your
family needs. Leave thc "for rent"
houses to those who are new nnd not
yet decided ns to what and wtysrc they
will do and reside. Tucumcari has
withstood this dry summer without
much hardship on the part of anyone,
so the day of experiment is pnssed.

The defence was handled by Harry K.
McElroy and J. D. Ctulip represented
the plaintiff.
Mr. Prentice heard thc case and

sued for, but thero is always some
satisfaction in winning a law-suit, if
it is not profitable.
