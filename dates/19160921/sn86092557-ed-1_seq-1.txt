All the Annies of Europe

Says Expert
MADE IN THIS COUNTRY
They Crash Over Trenches
and Spit Bullets At
Enemy
WASHINGTON, D. C? Sept. 11.?
A new terror ot war, the juggernaut,
has been introduced on the battlefields
of Europe, spreading destruction
where neither rifle, gun or cannon
was effective, and army men hare
predict UilAfiffjjenglnft fft dea*H -will
play as important a port in" the world
conflict as hare the submarine and
the aeroplane.
This land juggernaut clambers
across trenches and shell holes, spitting
bullets into the lines of the enemy,
smashes its way through forests,
crosses swamps with ease and crawls
along roads that have been called Impossible.
So far only the British have used
the "tanks" as they are being called
In the war zone, 'but army experts
predict that on account of their won
derful effectiveness the}- will soon be
in general" use, mowing down the armies
of all European nations at war.
Army men hall the coming ot the
"tanks" as they hailed first reports ot
successful use of the aeroplane tor
scouting duty and for directing Infantry
advances and as they bailed
first successful use ot submarines.
An army ot more than 1,000 ot
these steel armored caterpillar-whoeled
engines have been sent against the
German lines, mowing down men by
tbe hundreds and terrorizing welltrained
soldiers into disorganized retreat.
The new engines are made in the
United Slates?at Peoria, 111. Before!
| tbey reach Europe they are simply
! tarm tractors. At first they were
; used to pull munition carts, but the
j British have rigged them up with
' guns and sent them crashing right
| into the lines of the 'enemy.
Plants in Peoria are busy day and
; night turning out the machines?or{dinary
tractor engines the farmers1
j are using in this country.
Big, clumsy caterpillars they are,
{crawling along the ground on two
wide, corrugated belts, one on each
side, running over the forward and
bind wheels.
Along the sides of the belts are
short rails which clutch the cogged
i wheels and form the driving mechanism.
The rails, in short sections, are laid
down with the belt attachment, gripping
the ground firmly, and pushing
the 18,000-pound engine along under
120 horsepower.
The body of the tractor is supported
by trucks with five Vheels which
run on the steel rails. About seven
feet of belt and rails is on the ground
at once.
The length and width of the belts <
and rails allows the tractor to runj
smoothly over swamps, straddle
trenehM. roll ovpr InffR nr /?Hrr?K I
across shell craters.
As ordinary fanu tractors the engines
are shipped to Aldershot, England,
where they are covered with
heavy steel armor plate and armed
with cannon.
What the Germans see is a monstrous
machine, with a triangular
front, crawling upon them, crashing
through woods and other obstacles
with its pointed front, coming
Btraight on over trench and shell
hole, over mound and embankment.
As it advances it spits fire from Its
heavy guns, while its peculiar shape
makes it possible for its steel armor
to glance off any shell that happens
to hit it.
Zeppelins are overshadowed by this
juggernaut, for it has mowed down
more men than the Zepps have killed
and has scattered enemy lines to the
four winds.
