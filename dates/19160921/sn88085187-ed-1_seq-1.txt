ARREST TACOMA WOMAN UNDER "LAZY HUSBAND" LAW
'HONE COMPANY HAS
GREAT 616 KICK. 100,
MANAGER TELLS TIMES
BY E. A. PETERS
••The puhlice may think that It has h kick coming.
liul there'H one-thing thut the public doesn't hthi to know.
"The telephone company haw a hlfCKer kick conilnK. l>o
Jon know that this company is operating in Taconia at a
otM every day? Does the public realize that this InimenNe
corporation with an tnveHtment of nearly two and one
half minimis of dollars, In not making money here?
"Your own hoard of investigation, the public service
commission, hired to look out for the public's interests,
has found thlN out. It ought to know."
John Sc liliirli. manager for tlie telephone company. Is a little
man. Behind Ins big mahogany desk at the Market street office of
the Bell syndicate, he looks almost diminutive.
But when Schlarb begins fighting for lilm company, and shoots
out a few arguments like those quoted with the aid of a ringing
blow on the glossy desk, he looks as big as Jess Willard.
And Schlarb has the facts at ills finger's tips, and the punch
to accompany them, when he get excited.
Ever since Sept. 1, when the public service commission's new
rules regarding the management of telephone exchanges In Wash
ington took effect, Schlarb lias been the busiest man in town.
Every few minutes he has to answer the heated complaint of
tome irate subscriber.
And to add to the 'phone manager's burden, Manager Eawcett
has appointed a committee to wait upon the public service commis
sion and demand that the public get better treatment at the hands
of the phone people.
While Schlarb was attempting to explain some of the causes
for new rates, one of the irate subscribers buzzed the desk phone.
Evidently the rubscriber was complaining about the new rule
demanding payment of a $3.50 "service connection" charge for in
stallation of phone.
Merchants Order 'Em Out
"I know —I know," soothed Schlarb, "It seems like an exorbi
tant charge, but that's only because its a new one."
The subscribers sputtered for several minutes.
"You've just moved to a new address?" asked the manager.
"Well, you had to pay the moving man for hauling your furniture,
didn't you? And If It were a brand new house without water or
gas, you would have to pay fees to the city and the gas company
to have connections made, wouldn't you?"
"I'm sorry, old man, but if you were the president of the United
Slates I couldn't change the rule. 1 know, you feel sore about it.
And I'd be only too glad to do anything 1 could for you. But it
can't be done."
Schlarb hung up the receiver with relief.
Tacoma is up in arms against the telephone company, because
the public telephones In downtown stores are being replaced by
nlrUcl in the . loi machines, and because of the new rate charges
for Installation and moving of phones.
Numbers of merchants have ordered their telephones out be
•' cause the company demands that they install the 5-cent instru
ments.
Mayor Fawcett believes that when a man pays for a telephone
in his home, he shouldn't have to put a nickel in a slot before he
can call up his home and converse through an instrument that he
is already paying for.
But the new charges, authorized and sanctioned by the public
service commission, are causing most of the complaints.
Charges For Everything
If you want a new telephone in your home, or move to another
address, you have to pay $3.50 for installation. The only way to
beat the fee Is to move Into a house where the telephone of the
previous occupant has not yet been disconnected.
If you have your telephone moved to another part of the room,
it costs $1.
If It is moved to another room— $2.
Change from a wall to a desk phone or vice versa costs $1.
If you fail to pay your bill by the 15th of the month, the tele
_. phone will be disconnected, and It will cost a $1 fine before you
can use it again.
And besides this, rural subscribers who were formerly getting
phone service on a flat rate, are now being charged $1 extra for
every mile distance between their home and the exchange. It is
' costing many subscribers as high as $7 and $8 a month for tele-
phones.
The public Is apparently helpless, for the public service com
" mission, supposed to represent the people in all matters of differ
ence between the public and these corporations, has sanctioned all
these things.
Although the commission lopped off ten million dollars' valua
tion from the padded figures of the telephone company In Wash
ington, the figures of this same commission show that, for 1914,
the Tacoma exchange lost $16,43_, or .68 per cent on the invest
ment, and that the entire system in the state only made 2.3 8 per
cent profit on an Investment of $19,382,209.
And It will take the public a long time, and lots of energy ap
parently, before it can convince either of them that the new charges
are a mistake.

The complaint was filed by the

BY MABEL ABBOTT
"In latching a rat h>* the tail, if ><>n let him keep Ills
feet on the ground, he won't bite you. If you swing liim
clear of the floor, he will climb up his own tail and bite;
hut as long hn bis feet are touching something he will Just
scrabble along, trying to hold on.
"I've caught hundreds of nits with my bare hands.
"When 1 in-gaii rat-catching, In San Francisco in 1907, there
was a bounty of 10 cents apiece, in addition to my wages; and if I
saw a tail hanging out of a hole 1 couldn't resist the temptation to
grali It. But I always let the rat keep his feet on the ground as I
dragged him out, and I have never been bitten."
W. .1. Rogers, inspector for the V. S. public health service, was
sent to Tacoma a few days ago to catch and inspect rats and con
vict an anti-rat campaign to lessen the estimated annual loss of
$100,000 caused the city by these vermin.
He gave the foregoing expert advice as he Inspected a day's
catch, in his rattery in thp tower of the city jail.
The rattery is a sort of lumber-room directly under the clock
chamber. A rough table In front of a window serves as operating
table, and from a box and some wire-screened jars in a corner come
the squeaks of a colony of guinea-pigs.
When the rats are caught, the Inspector makes note of the
localities from which they come.
The spleens, which contain the germs of bubonic plague if any
are present at all, are removed, and the guinea-pigs inoculated with
them, and the inspector awaits results.
There have been no results In Tacoma thus far, and none are
expected. There is no plague scare |iere.
The V. S. health service simply keeps up the inspection as a
measure of precaution.
Nine gray, furry little carcasses were stretched on nine shingles
with a clothspin to each leg, and the inspector, in white gown and
rubber autopsy gloves, was opening each rat to examine the viscera.
"You have to know how, in order to make a success of rat
catching," he said, pulling and snipping gruesomely with his tiny,
shining pincers and scissors.
"You must know where the rats are in the habit of going.
Little paths, worn smoother than the rest of the floor, polished
places on the ends of scantlings, where the rats have rubbed against
them as they passed—there are a dozen little signs that show where
to set your traps.
"For bait I use something the rats like but don't get every
day—bacon in a trap set In a granary; or grain or cheese in a
butcher shop. Sunflower seed is good.
'"I set the traps in the morning, then go around next morning
and take out the dead rats and set them again. I carry the rats
up liere in a suitcase, drop them Into chloroform to kill the fleas—
the rat flea is the plague-carrier—and then open and examine
then all.
"Yes, I like the business. It's a real service to mankind. I
left the government service for a little while and went Into police
work; but I came back again. I'd rather catch rats tban human
beings.
"The only thing I'm afraid of Is that my suitcase
'will burst open on the street some day."
