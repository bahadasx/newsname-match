DEATH OF THE
PRESIDENT'S SISTER,
MRS. ANNIE JOSEPHINE HOWE
PASSES TO THE OTHER WORLD
-BURIED AT COLUMBIA.
President Wilson came to Columbia
Monday, for the first time since
his inauguration, to bury his only
* T u:?
sister, Mrs Annie josepmuc nunt
of Philadelphia, wife of the late
George Howe, M D, of Columbia.
Mrs Howe died Friday at New London,
Conn. Quietly and sadly, he
attended the simple funeral services
at the First Presbyterian church,
where his father and other relatives
have held pastorates, and then
walked with relatives to the family
plot in the brick walled churchyard
and stood with bowed head during
the brief committal rites.
Afterward he lunched with his
party aboard the special train. During
the afternoon he called upon his
venerable aunt, Mrs Felie B Woodrow,
visited the house at 1705 Hampton
street designed, built and occupied
for some years by his father,
and spent three-quarters of an hour
at the Columbia seminary, an ancient
and honorable institution with
which the Wilsons, the Woodrows
and the Howes have many associations.
Th6 President and his party left
^ Columbia in their special train at
6:15 o'clock Monday evening for the
summer White House, Shadow
Lawn, at Long Branch, N J.
Columbians, with numbers of visitors
from other sections of South
Carolina, gathered by thousands
along the streets to see the President,
but they respected his grief
and made no demonstrations. During
the trip Southward station platforms
en route were crowded, but
there was no cheering. Flowers
were put aboard at several places
* by school children. The presidential
special, comprising three private
cars, a baggage car and a diner,
pulled into Columbia at 11:35 o'clock.
The platform at the south end of
the station had been cleared. The
funeral party crossed the platform
to waiting limousines and proceeded
immediately to the church, via
Gervais and Marion streets, une
secret service operative rode with
the driver of the President's automobile,
five others following in cars
which bore the other members of
the family. A touring car which
preceded the motor hearse carried
the pallbearers: James Woodrow,
fcouglas McKay, McDavid Horton,
Julius H Taylor, M D, Reed Smith
and Joseph Hyde Pratt.
After lunching aboard their train
at 1:15 o'clock, the President, with
Mrs Wilson, Miss Margaret Wilson,

Joseph R Wilson of Baltimore and
the White House physician, Cary T
Grayson, M D, set out in an open
motor car to visit some of the scenes
of his boyhood. The party stopped
at the norrneasc corner ox ouma-i
and Washington streets in order that
the President might call upon his
aunt, Mrs F B Woodrow. She welcomed
him as "Tommy" an^ remarked
to Mrs Wilson: "Since he
took to writing books he calls himself
Woodrow." Mrs Woodrow attended
the burial service. Thence
the party proceeded to 1705 Hampton
street, premises owned now by
J M VanMetre. Mr and Mrs Wilson
got out in order to inspect the
dwelling, which Joseph R Wilson
built and in which the family resided
during the four years (1870-74)
(in which the elder Wilson was a
member of Columbia seminary faculty.
Several boys were playing about
the house Dr Grayson asked one
of them if he expected to be President.
"I don't know/' the boy said.
"I wouldn't wish anything like that
on you," the President struck in.
Afterward the President visited 1531
Blanding street, a dwelling on the
northwest corner of Blanding and
Pickens streets, which was built by
the Rev George Howe, D D, and in
which the President's late sister and
her husband, the late George Howe,
M D, lived for some years. Fortyfive
minutes were devoted to an exploration
of Columbia seminary, after
which the President's party
drove out to the ruins of Millwood,
a country seat of the Hamptons,
burned by Sherman's army in 1865.
Returning to his train, the President
received several relatives and
chatted with newspaper men for a
few minutea. Some hundreds of
sympathetic persons had gathered
to speed him on his way. As the
special pulled out the President appeared
on the observation platform
and bowed. His face was graver
than usual.
At the President's own request,
State and city officials omitted official
recognition of his presence,
but the flags on the State house and

Merchants had offered to close their
places of business and drape their

of respect were also omitted in deference
to the Presiden't wishes.
The people behaved with perfect
propriety, baring their heads as the
funeral passed and keeping a reverlent
and respectful silence.? Col urn.

LARGE DEAL IN TIMBER?NEW

Lake City, September 20:?Dr W
; H Steele came down from Rockingham,
N C, last week and spent sev!
eral days in town and community.
Mr Ashley McElveen left Monday
I for Bamberg where he will enter
the Bamberg Fitting School.
Miss Addie McAllister last Monday
went to the Horry Industrial
School, near Conway, where she expects
to take a full course of study
and training. Her guardian. Mr H
N Merritt, accompanied her from
: here to look after getting his ward
enrolled and settled.
Mr.T H DnPrp of the engineer
! ? '
ing corps, who has charge of the
distribution of funds for the relief
j of the flood sufferers in this section,
was in town Friday on business.
| Several hundred dollars of that
j fund are distributed here each Saturday
in paying for work on roads
! and road ditches. This money will
greatly help many a poor man who
lost practically everything he had.
County Supervisor J B McBryde
was in^town Friday looking after
affairs of the county, especially road
repairing.
! The Imperial Tobacco Co, which is
! already working about seven hun
dred hands, is now advertising for a
thousand. It is said that the plant
here is proving such a success that
the company will ship in their leaf
tobacco from North Carolina mar|
kets to be cleaned, stemmed, redried
and prepared for export. The
weekly payroll of this company is
turning loose thousands of dollars
in this section, and ought to help
trade very much.
A right big deal was completed
last week, we understand, when the
Deep River Lumber Co bought the
Graham timber. This is perhaps
one of the finest bodies of timber remaining
in the country, and no
doubt commanded several thousand
dollars as the purchase price.

NOTICE!
We wish to call especial attention
" - - i i !
to the club of magazines aaveruseu i
in connection with The Record. This
is by far the biggest magazine bargain
that we have ever offered our
readers. And as a hint to the wise,
we suggest that you avail yourselves
of it at once, since we have already
been advised by the publishers that j
on account of the tremendous in-1
crease in the cost of white paper the I
regular subscription price of these j
magazines will be increased in the j
near future. Send in your order j
now and get a double bargain. |

Pure Bred Fowls.
Purebred poultry is more profitable
!or supplying eggs or chickens than
nongrels. Stock can be purchased (
>f strains bred for heavy egg pro- '
luction, particularly in the single I
:omb white Leghorn, that will lay 1
nore eggs yearly than fowls not '
laving this heavy laying trait. Pure- 1
obir-lrona of tho cronprfll nnr. '

[rowing period make a more rapid
ind economical gain in weight than >
nongrels. At no age are mongrel '
hickens as salable as purebreds,
ind, for satisfying the demands of
he critical egg and poultry markets
hat require a uniform production .
if high quality chickens, mongrel (
>oultry is not satisfactory. ,
When you decide in the fall to j
aise poultry, buy a breeding pen of ?
oung stock. One cockerel and ]
rom twelve to fifteen pullets is a
uitable breeding pen. By starting (
his way a poultry plant can be 1
*
tocked in two years. On account ,
if the low cost of purebred fowls,
t is unprofitable to try to grade up j
i flock of mongrel poultry by the ,
ise of Durebred males, as is the
general practice with scrub cattle.
If you already have a flock of 1
?oultry, after the molting season is 1
iver in the fall, kill or remoye all
urplus males, broken down hens
ind young chickens, leaving only
he mature pullets and young hens,
iens lay as well without a rooster i

able and cooking use and should be <
jroduced when chicks are not re- <
