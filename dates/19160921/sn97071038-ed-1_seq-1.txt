Honors
Glenn Hadley, the Hardman wrest

ln.'n of this city in their tussle at the
Star theatre last Saturday afternoon.
I The boys put up a fairly good exhibi

the first fall after 39 minutes of hard,
fast work. The second fall came
easier, Groshen's shoulders going to
I the mat after a struggle which lasted
j barely five minutes.
Hadley is 21 years of age and
.weighs about 153 pounds. Oroshen
is of a much heavier build but slow
er on his feet. The Hardman boy dis
played a greater knowledge of the
game and appeared stronger at all
times than his adversary. Groshen
is on'y 17 years old and has had but
little; mat experience, Thoe who
have watched Ins work the closest say
that he is a comer aiul will be heard
from In another year or two. It Is
possible that another match will be
arranged between Hadley and Gro
shen in the near future, liauman of
Lexington appeared in the capacity of
referee. A large crowd attended the
match, there being a big representa
tion of Hardman present.

SELLS FOR 135,000
One of the largest realty transac
tions of the season took place at Lex
ington last week, when Frank and
Jeff Evans, operating under the name
!of. Evans Brothers, sold their 1280
jacre wheat farm to Chas. R. Pointer
and N. A. and W. E. Leach. The new
firm will be known as Leach Broth
ers & Pointer. The price paid was
$35,000.
This ranch Is considered one of the
'best In the county. For years, Evans
Brothers have been tilling their soil
in a successful manner and they have
accumulated considerable money.
Their ranch is located six miles north
of Lexington.
Everything on the ranch goes In on
the deal and the Evans Brothers will
remain on the place long enough to
put In next year's crop. The new ow-
, ners expect to" take possession about
the 1st of December.
I In speaking of the deal, Mr. Poin
ter said it was not one of specula
tion, but was strictly a farming pro
position. A practical farmer, a man
from the Willamette Valley, and his
.family will move onto the ranch. Mr.
I Pointer, who owns a large acreage a
few miles from the Evans ranch, will
superintend the farming of both his
old ranch and the new property. He
will make his home In Lexington from
now on, and another family will live
ion his place.
I Mr. Leach is one of Lexington's
'progressive business men and was
: formerly president of the Morrow
I County Fair Board. He is engaged in
the general merchandise business In
Lexington. His brother, N. A. Leach
'was formerly In partnership with him
I In the Lexington store but of more re
Icent years has made his home in
Portland. At the present time he
has charge of the Portland office of
the Kerr-Glfford Company.
We have riot learned what the
Evans Brothers expect to do or where
they will decide to locate, but Mor
row county cannot afford to lose such
men as they. Let us hope that they
will decide to remain here.

THE COUfjl! FAIR IS
EXHIBITS ARE TAKEN 10 STATE FAIR
The Fourth Annual Morrow County
Fair came to a close at 12 o'clock
; midnight on Saturday and from now
,011 It will be the 5th Annual Morrow
County Fair. Secretary Sniead left
Wednesday morning for Salem with
one of the most comprehensive exhib
its ever taken out of the county and
lie will arrange them for display at
the Oregon State Fair which opens
there on Monday.
i "It is a wonderful display of your
resources," said O. E. Freytag of Ore
gon City, who was on hand to judge
exhibits and later prepare the C. A.
Minor exhibit for shipment to Salem
where It will be entered at the State
;Fair. Mr. Freytag is one of the most
competent judges of grains and grass-
'es in the Northwest and his enthus
iastic praise of our exhibits comes
I from a man who is qualified to speak.
So many of us here little realize what
(fine stuff we raise and as a conse
quence are slow In appreciating it,
but not so with one who has been
called to judge the products of prac
tically every county in the state of
Oregon. By comparison, Morrow
county ranks at the head of the list.
One feature of the Fair this year
was the increased interest on the part
of those exhibiting, the manner in
which they prepared their exhibits
and the number of new exhibitors.
Probably next to the Fair Board It
self, no one worked harder in pre
paring an exhibit and strived harder
for the general success of the Fair
than did C. A. Minor. This was Mr.
t Minor's third .year as an individual
exhibitor and each year he has had
something better to give the public.
At this time Mr. Minor's exhibits were
displayed In three booths, the first
one being a general display of farm
j products, all of the highest quality,
I the second booth, the most beautiful
of the three, a display arranged ar
tistically and due largely to the ef-
' nP U.a flnnn tt nvAf K A A O
aaimas, mi uie nowers ueiug-gruwu
on the Minor ranch four miles south
of Heppner. The third booth was an
arrangement of sheaf grains, the
greater part of the exhibit consisting
of varieties which Mr. Minor secured
from the Canadian exhibit at the Panama-Pacific
International Exposition.
Like many other exhibitors, Mr. Mi
. 11. 1 1 1 1 m 1 1
nor was handicapped this year on ac-
count of the late growing season. He
was unable to bring in some of his
finest corn and other vegetables for
the reason It had not yet matured.
Another feature In the third booth
was some excellent farm scenes en
larged after being taken with a graf
lex camera. Mr. Minor has taken his
exhibit to the State Fair and it is
useless for us to say that it will be
the cause for wonderment and com
ment on the part of all who view it
there. The exhibit includes most ev
erything that was ever grown on a
farm that has any practical use In the
life of mankind.
A new exhibit this year came from
Cecil. Here again we find a great di
versity of products which has made
a name for the county throughout the
Northwest. Vegetables and fruits
featured strongly in the Cecil display
while the grains and grasses made a
strong background. Dairy products
were also given prominence. The
Cecil exhibit was the cause of much
j favorable comment.
Irrlgon was on hand as usual with
a great display of apples, pears,
SCHOOL NOTES.
By S. E. Notson, Co. Supt.
The new course of study is now
ready for distribution. The teach
ers will be supplied as soon as pos
sible. Teachers should read the
course through to see what changes
have been made.
With only two exceptions, all the
contracts filed in the office provide for
eight or nine months of school. There
will be very few six and seven months
terms this year. The average length
of term for 1st year showed an in
crease over the year before of nearly
half a month. It is generally under
stood that the legislature will be ask
ed to make the minimum term eight
i months, and the prospects are that
such a law will be enacted.
The State Superintendent has again
called attention to the rule of the
State Board of Health in regard to
the common drinking cup. It is a
violation of the regulations for the
pupils to use a common drinking cup.
A closed Jar or tank of water
should be provided. Then each pupil
should have his own cup. Just be
cause the Board of Health has not
prosecuted all the violations of this
regulation should not be taken as an
excuse for falling to comply. If one
case of diptherla or other contagious
disease should be prevented by the
combined efforts of the school boards
of the entire county, the efforts would
be worth while. Most people would
agree to this proposition if they knew
OVER AND THE
peaches, watermelons, squashes,
grapes, and a long list of products too
lengthy to mention. The exhibit was
in charge of Professor and Mrs. W. L.
Suddarth. Mr. Suddarth is principal
of the Irrlgon school and his wife also
teaches there. They are live boosters
for the Irrlgon section and their work
in installing the exhibit added much
for Irrlgon. They said the year had
not been the best ior Irrigon, which
only makes us want to see what those
people would raise in a good year.
All of the exhibit was certainly high
class.
The "Sagenhuret Farm" of B. H.
Peck was represented with an artis
tically arranged exhibit. Mr. Peck
has taken his exhibit to Salem for
entry in the State Fair. All of the
products of Sagenhurst Farm are
grown without irrigation and when
this is taken into consideration, the
showing is indeed remarkable.
D. Cox of Hinton creek was on
hand with a special exhibit. Mr. Cox
is a taxidermist of no mean ability
and he had some of his work in this
line on display. Products from the
Cox ranch were also given promin
ence. The year's work of the school chil
dren in their industrial club work
and the results obtained were shown
in their extensive exhibit. Mrs. C. W.
Shurte, Miss Ethel Casey and Miss
Marlon Long were in charge of this
exhibit. Mrs. C. C. Patterson had
charge of the exhibit of work done
by children under nine years of age.
Music and Attractions Good.
In the Portland Ad Club Quartette
and the La Grande Elks' Band, the
Fair visitors were given a rare treat.
The band boys were not a bit stingy
with their music and played on every
occasion. On the second and third
days the band and quartette made a
good combination on the street in the
music and songs. At the dances, al
so, the quartette entertained In the
eary hours of the evening.
"The aeroplane flights by Herbert
Munter proved an attraction. Munter
showed the people that he has perfect
control of his machine and his work
was highly satisfactory.
Although the street sports showed
a lack of previous arrangement or
preparation, nevertheless some inter
esting contests were held which suc
ceeded ih holding the crowds.
Portland Man Leases Palace Hotel
Grill.
E. J. Wood of Portland has leased
the Palace hotel grill from J. L. Wil
kins and took possession on Wednes
day. Mr. Wood has had considerable
! hotel experience, having conducted
the beach hotel at Bayocean for the
i last three years. It will be his aim
jto improve the service in the Palace
dining room in every possible man
ner although no radical changes will
be made at the present time. Mr. and
Mrs. Wood have taken rooms in the
S. W. Spencer residence on Chase
street and are preparing to make
their home here permanently. They
are very much impressed with our
city and are desirous of cooperating
in every possible way with our bus
iness men and citizens.
FOR SALE A 1910 model Buick
car in good condition. Will sell at a
sacrifice. Inquire at this office.
It would be their child who escaped
by the compliance with the regula
tion. Miss Fox of the Bureau of Educa
tion at Washington has been secured
as one of the instructors at the in
stitute Sept. 25-27. Dr. DeBusk, of
the State Universitv. and M. S. Pitt-
man,of the Oregon Normal School will
also have places on the program.
WANTED A man to build con
crete foundation for school house at
Castle Rock, Ore. Contractors may
secure further Information bv wrltinir
to J. A. Gibbons, clerk of school board
at Castle Rock.
E. C. Ashbaugh, for many years a
resident of Morrow county, and at
one time extensively engaged in busi
ness in Heppner, returned last week
to the scenes of his former activity
and enjoyed several days visiting
with relatives and friends while at
tending our county fair. Mr. Ash
baugh Is now traveling salesman for
the Rosenfeld-Smith Company of
Pnrtlnnrl lil,,.. !., j . I
dealers. Their leading brand is the
El Rio-Tan cigar, which Mr. Ash
baugh urges his friends to give a
trial have they not already done so.
More than 150,000,000 of these ci
gars were sold last year. Mr. Ash
baugh has a territory to cover which
takes him south from Portland thru
the Willamette Valley. He reports
trade brisk in his line.
Oregon Boys and Gills Stick to Club
Woik.
Oregon boys are sticking to their
club work much closer than ever be
fore and many of them are complet
ing it, ' says L. J. Allen, director of
pig club work. "Much better work
is also being done and results as a
whole are very good.
Mr. Allen has just completed a
3,000 mile journey in a Ford, visiting
the club leaders. In connection with
the county school superintendents he
visited as largely as possible the
homes of the club members, spending
from three to four days in each of the
following counties: Sherman, Mor
row, Umatilla, Wallowa, Union, Ba
ker, Malheur, Crook, Lake and Kla
math. He also spent a day or so In
Wasco, Jackson, Josephine and Doug-
Parents are becoming more inter
ested than ever before and in some
places he found that the mothers had
organized canning, baking and sewing
clubs taking the ten lessons and doing
the work as prescribed for their daug
ters. Many of the members will not only
complete their work in the various
projects but will also exhibit the re
sults at local, county and state fairs.
Mr. Allen gave assistance In many In
stances as well as Inspected the work
and showed how to prepare exhibits.
Although the boys are required to
grow but one pig in the pig raising
project he found them growing on an
average from three to four, some of
them as many as fifty or more.
While the season for crops has
been somewhat unfavorable crop
growing has succeeded well especially
ror inose Doys wno gave careiui at
tention to seed selection, testing it
for germinating power and purity and
treating it for disease.
In some instances boys were found
gardening two or , three acres al
though the project requires but one
sixteenth of an acre. He also found
boys growing three acres of potatoes.
Two acres of corn, and doing much
more than is required by the rules.
Very few final records have been
made out, since this cannot be done
until the work for the year has been
closed.
. TAX NOTICE.
fheTast half oT the 191o taxes are
now due and payable. All tax not
paid on or before October 5th become
delinquent, and is subject to penalty,

IONE NEWS NOTES.
James R. Land for long years a
resident of lone and a highly respect
ed citizen died at his home in this
city early Monday morning at the ad
vanced age of 82 years. Mr. Land
had been an invalid for many years
suffering from partial paralysis and i
the infirmities of old age. He had a
resident of Morrow County for the
past 18 years. He was a native of
North Carolina but the greater por
tion of his life was spent in the West.
Short services were held at the grave
Wednesday afternoon, Rev. J. L.
Jones officiating, and funeral services
will be held at the Baptist church
Sunday morning next. Rev. C. B.
Bailey delivelng the discourse. Mr.
Land leaves besides his aged widow,
nine children, all grown and residing
in various parts of the country.
Tourist travel is picking up again
through lone. We cannot boast too
much for the fine quality of the roads
leading In this way, but much im
provement has been made by the
strawing that has been done, and it
looks good to see the big autos string
ing through town, each one headed
for the Round-Up city. If the "black
and blue trail" between lone and
Heppner is ever put in shape for com
fort there will be a lot of rejolcjng
down this way. That road is a dis
grace to Morrow County, and it is get
ting more disgraceful each 'day. We
certainly believe that a united and
persistent effort should be made by
the residents of the North end to get
this highway In decent shape and
then have It properly maintained.
Some people think all the road mon
ey is spent In and around Heppner to
the disadvantage of other portions of

MORROW COUNTY
AT THE EXPOSITION
By Oscar E. Freytag, Chief of ArtK
culture, Oregon Commission, At
the Panama-Pacific-International
Exposition.
What Morrow County can do was
expressed by the abundant exhibit of
superior grains and grasses and other
fine exhibit material that was contri
buted by her farmer citizens two
years ago, first for use at the Se
cond Annual Morrow County Fair,
the success of which encouraged an
exhibit at the State Fair, where first
prize was carried off with flattering
margin. The land show at Portland
was the next scene of victory, and
then after being rearranged, this
much be-ribboned and prized exhibit
was sent on to San Francisco, whore
it was a part of the splendid show
ing of the resources of the state of
Oregon at the Panama Exposition.
After the re-arrangement made ne
cessary by the many handlings, a part
of the specimens were used In the
Eastern Oregon booth in the Oregon
Building where no exhibits were ele
gible, to award, and the remainder
was placed in the Palace of Agricul-
.re, where a i exhibits v entered
fir pward. Here was real . ompeti
tion, for many states and many for
iegn countries vied with each other
for highest standing in exhibits. A
wards were made absolutely on merit
the Jury composed of men who were
authorities In their line.
Oregon took a back seat for no one,
either for beauty of products, or for
rare excellence, and Morrow County's
10 foot wild rye grass and other fine
grasses, helped to get the highest pos
sible award, Medal of Honor for Ore
gon's forage crops.
Morrow County standing alone,
without personal representation car
ried off more medals and diplomas
than any other Eastern Oregon Coun
ty. The secret of this? The pro
ducts talked for themselves to the
Jury, but' were-"the source of - much
questioning by the interested visitors,
who wanted to know more about Mor
row County. The Chief of Agricul
ture could give a good report of this
prosperous county and of the promi
nent citizens who are working always
with its interests at heart.
It was a great Fair, and Morrow
County did her part In getting Ore
gon before the world, and at the
same time she has made some noise
for her own community.
The working of a great Interna
tional Exposition is necessarily te
dious, but the awards will finally
reach the entrants, just how soon it
is impossible to predict, a matter of
a few weeks or months however.
The abundant success of Morrow
County in this, the broadest field of
competion of many years, should spur
the people onto a more enthusiastic
endeavor to excel, each in his particu
lar line. The great and' lasting good
of all Fairs is the incentive to pro
gress, and at the annual county fair
the inspiration may be found by com
petition as well as in the larger.
Exhibits such as Morrow county
can produce and has produced aTe
sure to help the county for the beau
tiful alfalfa, sheaf wheat, oats and
barley tell a story of a good stock
country, with hogs and hens running
a close second, and a picture comes
into the ennid of the rolling hills, and
a vast expanse of wheat fields. To
us who know it, Into the picture
comes the pretty metropolis of the
county, nestled at the head of a Val
ley surrounded by low lying, shel
tering hills.
