FARMERS' MEETING
GREAT SUCCESS
Unexpected Interest Manifested in
Loan Bank.
At 3 o'clock sharp Monday af
ternoon, perhaps the best repre.
sentative crowd of Washington
Parish farmers ever assembled
here, was called to order in the
court-room by Judge P. B. Car
ter acting chairman. Judge Car
ter merely stated that the object
of the meeting was to instruct
the farmer and business men of
this section in regard to the re- i
cent Federal law relative to the I
establishment of Farm Loan t
Banks thruout the United States, I
and introduce; Ts the first speak- a
er, Senator D. R. Johnson. Mr. t
Johnson explained that the part d
we were to take in this was to se- t.
oure the location of one of these h1
banks in the city of New Orleans; p
that while all assembled there, V
were not farmers, yet he was 01
convinced that every man present ft
was more or less interested in
borrowing money, and that the tt
United States government was o(
only now introducing a system m
which has been wonderfully sue. re
ceessful in the old country for d(
mai:y years, and the only reason A
it has not been tried here is be. th
cause the Democrats have not lo;
been in power before. Mr. John. be
san's idea was that this section on
thru the systematic organization foi
recowmended, would be greatly nm
benefited not only by obtaining of
these loans at a low rate and on pa
long terms, but also by the great bu
confidence that would be estab- bu
lished by each member in bis etc
fellow farmer-a thing of great roe
importance. thE
Mr. Lippert, "the man of the I
hour" then took the stand, say- bol
ing that his tour is really a cam- ar(
paign of explanation, whereupon bei
he preceeded to explain in full the it I
Farm Loan Bank systom. ra,
He says that the south, while me
producing more than one-half of the
all the agriculural produots of sec
the nation, yet is doing only 15 bai
per cent of what she could do, '
and this falling short of what she tio!
could do is wholly due to lack of
fnnd, to carry on progressive and bai
profitable farming. pet
Washington Parish has 430,000 cht
acres of land at an assessed value 20
of $600,000 and only 10 per cent yet
of her lands are being used. Our red
lands average about $13 per acre ly
while just at our door the same it N
quantity of land in Tangipahoa is pai
valued at $40 per acre, and it
eannot be said that there is more Fr
power in the brain and neither
more power in the arm of the Tan- for
af- gipahoi farmer than in the Wash.
pre. ington farmer-the difference is
ton in the money they have to develop
;led their lands. This bank law pro
the vides a way whereby every man
ar- who has followed a plow may fol
ar- low it now on his own land.
ject There are to be ffve banks
ut placed in the south, and a Loan
of Board from the National Govern
re- ment, is investigating to see the
the best way of dividing up the dis
)an tricts and everything possible is
,s, being done to show New Orleans
ak- as the logical point for this. sec
Jr. tion. All of Louisiana is consoli- i
art dated on this, and it is believed 1
e- that $760,000 capital required by
!se law will all be subscribed by the
s; patriotic citizens of the state.
Ire With this capital a loan of $15,- f
as 000,000 can be secured for our
nt farmers and more if required. g
in There is to be no dealing with t
he the individzal, but an aspociation o
as consisting of at least ten men
m must be organized with five di- T
a. rectors, a President, Vice-Presi- iH
r dent and Secretary-Treasurer. of
in And this association must value ir
- the lands and recommed the b,
)t loans-any responsible farmer
a. being able to secure a loan of e1
n one-half the value of his land and fa
n for a period of 40 years. Money
y may be borrowed for the purpose
of buying the farm lands and E
paying off mortage on farms, to
buy live stock, to drain lands, to
build silos, improve farm houses, h
etc., but only a farmer can bor
t row and he for no other purpose
than to improve his farm.
No banker nor merchant can
borrow from this fund, but they ba
are both encouraging the move,
because any business man sees lii
e it will build up the country mi
raculously, then there will be liH
more clothing and supplies for
the merchant to furnish and con- lit
sequently more money for the
banker to handle. Fe
The three important considera.
tions for the farmer are: Ba
"How is my loan to be paid
I back?" Answer: $1,000 at 6 y"
per cent can be entirely dis- N'
charged interest and principal in a"
20 years by paying $87.19, per
year. This pays the interest and 15
r reduces the principal so gradual
ly that the burden is never felt as to
it would be if the $1000 had to be
paid in full at any one date. NC
t "In what sums can it be had?" da
SFrom $100 to $10,000.
r "What terms'?" From five to in
forty years.

This thing is backed by tho
United States Government and
can't possibly be a loss. The
move is instigated purely from ,
motive to help the farmer who
would progress if he had the
means. The young farmer lad
who wants to settle to his life's
work and have his own home and
family in independence hereto.
fore has had to tend land on
shares and have nothing at the
close of each year except his
" year's supplies, and rather than s
s continue with his nose to the
P grind-stone, will leave the farm
- in disgust and go to some public j
work at a great loss to country
and town both. With the bene
fit of these proposed loans any o
industrious honest farmer boy d
can buy his own farm, and work t
steadily forward to progress anu w
independence, and those who)
have been tenants for generations ,a
can now be individual land
ownerbs.
Proof that the farmers want it
in this section is that Tangipahoa F
has applied for $579,000, Coving
ton $375,000, Bogalusa, $43,000,
Ticfaw, $97,000.
While adjournment was had be.
for a footing was made of the ap
plications here Monday, it was
grossly estimated that Franklin. tri
ton and vicinity would use $100,. an
000. ca
The Washington Bank and I
Trust Co.. thru its representative, t
on M. M. W. Ott, pledged hearty I
co-operation with the farmers,
e in its public spirited way this
e bank will take active steps in I
r promoting this, the greatest move I
f ever made in the interest of the
d farmer.
