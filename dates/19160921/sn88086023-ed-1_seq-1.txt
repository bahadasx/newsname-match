WiUest of All WUd and Wooly Town Open Third Year of
Thrilling History With Nearly 3000 People in Attendance
"Street" Program Keep Big Throng in Gale of Laugh
ter "Red Dog Saloon and Gambling Palace" Makes Big
Hit Dance Hall Crowded Until Midnight.
Happy Canyon, wildest of all wild
and wooly towns, opened tho third
year of Its exciting history lout even
ing la the new pavilion to which It
had been transplanted. Between 1601)
and 1100 people were present to help
lift the ltd.
It won a noisily successful grand
opening despite the fact that the
sound of the hammer and saw had
hardly 'died sway before the yips of
the cowboy announced the show wan j
on. The work of building the new :
112,000 pavilion was not completed
last evening but enough of it was
doni- to enable the show to be staged.
In spite of this handicap and In
pit of the fact that no rehearsals
had been held, the street" program ,
waa presented in a way that kept the
crowd In laughter and applause. I
At the conclusion of the program
at 9:80 the crowd swarmed into tmi
teJ Ixg Saloon and Gambling I "a I-1
ace," and the Happy Canyon dance
hall In numbers that caxed tho capac
ity ol those fun resorts. While in j
dreds stepped to the Uveal music ever
heard at a dance in Pendleton, other
hundreds gathered about the gam-'
log bibles and. with the sky as the
limit, played their buck bills to win or
lose at the drop of a little Ivory bull. '

The wildest and most exciting fea-j
tors of the preliminary street pro-'
gram wa the fighting steer turned
loose as the last act before the open
ing of the Indoor sports. It Is no ex
aggeration to say rtmt the steer was
both wild and fighting , mad. The
Happy Canyon steers of la 14 and
1015 wire lame In comparison with
the long horned brute that cha, ed
oowbovs In all directions last even
ing. A half doten cowboys with red sc
rapes which they waved Into the face
of the brute chased him about the
street for ten minutes before his
lighting blood was really aroused.
About hi." neck was a leathern strap
to take off which was worth a real
greenback to any cowboy. It . was
Frank McCarroll of Boise, wrestler,
boxer, bulldogger and Happy Canyon
strong man of last year, who first
came to close quarters with the stoer.
As the animal dashed past him he
seised Its horns and was dragged al
most the length of the street before
he checked Its speed. Tn a minute s
dossa more cowboys were atop the
brute fighting for the strap but It was
McCarroll who unbuckled It.
As they turned the steer loose again
there was a wild scattering of cowboys

and the others In the street, for tho
animal, Infuriated at the treatment It
had reeived, dashed with lowered
horns upon his tormentors. Several
were forced to climb the wire fence
to the grandstand for safety and oth
ers sought refuge as best they might
Charles Wellington Furlong, Boston
author and cowboy pro tern, was one
of the most persistent tormentors of
the steer und three times the steer
rushed at him so suddenly that he was
forced to throw himself on the
ground to esmape the menacing horns.
Knch time the steer ran over him
atjd today he has a few bruises to re
mind him of the hoofs that trampled
upon him.
McCarroll tested his strength
against the sieer a second time and
bulldogged the animal after a hard
and thrilling fight. But though
thrown the steer was not conquered.
Arising he dashed again at the ow
Ijovs whereupon Dell Blancett seized
him by the tail. Instantly there was
a merry-go-round. Blancett held on
to trio tail and the steer endeavored
to reach the cowboy with his horns,
only stopping long enough to dash at
some other owboy wno came close up.
Once the animal dushed under the
end of the grandstand and into the
dieting room where me high school
"wood nymphs" were assembled.
Shrill feminine cries, the whooping ot
cowboys and the thrashing about ot
the steer was all the audience heard
for a few moments, and then the
brute came dashing into the street
agiilu.
McCarroll, who had twice tackled
the brute, won tribute even from the
other cowboys when ne took a charge
of the steer head on, grasping the
horns as they came piunging at him.
His great strength neld the untmal

quickly and made nls escape. The

There was a real artistic, almost
classic number of the program last
evening. It was the dance of the
wood nymphs by the nine high school

SIDELIGHTS
Dave White furnished much am
usement for the visitors at Round
Up Park last Friday during the try
outs. Grandma, the little grey ter
ror of the cowboys, who had been
successful in piling her riders during
the tryouts was brought out for
I White to ride. After trying several
I varieties of bucking the horse fell over
. and White was thrown. The cow
boy undaunted immediately got up
and taking hold of the saddlehorn
made a strong attempt to mount the
animal again. Finally with a lunge
the horse freed itself. White was
I given a good hand by the spectators
j for his pluck.
Lee Caldwall, who holds the world's
I championship bucking title, was
I twice matched this year against Em
( ory Le Grande, the well known cow
j boy. At Moose Jaw, Caldwell wrest
ed the Canadian honors from Le
j Grande after the latter had held the
j toga for two years in succession. A
I short time later at the New York
Stampede 1 Grande beat out the
I Pendleton boy. Caldwell says that I
Grande Is undoubtedly one of the pret.
. tlest and most graceful bucking horse
I riders in the countrv, and withal a
! prince of a fellow. He is 38 years old
and has been foreman of the Big Iy
ranch in Alberta for 12 years.

Round-Up Park, Thursday After
noon Does the Round-Uo still main
tain its hold upon the popular fancy.
In spite of Its six years of age and Its
many Imitations?
The answer is written plainly In
human figures here this afternoon. It
is told by the attendane at the open
ing day of the seventh annual exhibi
tion, an attendance that Is easily tna
largest for an opener in the past four
years, if not since the Round-Up first
began. The grandstand is a solid
pack and the flanking bleachers are
half niled.
It Is estimated that there are be
tween 10,000 and 12,000 watching the
first show of the 1911 Round-Up.
Bauds W elcome Vhdtora,
The gates were open at 12 o'clock
and there were hunareds in the first
rush through. The Round-Up, La
Grande Elks, Hilton. Athena and
Weston bands began playing at I
o'clock and the crowd kept pourinS
through the gates In a steady stream
until the crack of a pistol announced
that the Round-Up was under way.
Spectacle Is Superb.
The scene presented' to the thou
sands of visitors Is one that cannot
but enrapture and thrill. Opposite
the crowd and lined up Just beyond
the back stretch of track sit hundred
of cowboys and cowgrrls on their pon
ies waiting for their turn in the
grand western playday. ' Their gaudy
shirts and chaps, their gay kerchiefs
and bright trappings stand oat in
splotches of color against the back
ground of green trees and white te
pees of the Indian encampment.
The arena and track is so full of
action that the eye scarcely has time
to revel in the beauty of the scene.
Man struggles with orute for supre
macy, the brute as orten the victor as
the vanquished; whooping owboy
astride sinewy ponies, dash past in
clouds of dust; Indians, their tawny
bodies bedecked in oarbaric splendor,
dance or parade or race; stagecoach
es, clumsy old forerunners of tho fart
express, careen and pitch along their
course to exemplify the danger and
hardship of travel in pioneer times,
outlaw mustang rear and rlunge and
snort in their maddened efforts to rid
themselves of their Human burdens;
steers, shaking their lone menacing
horns, race across tne field unly to
have their wild flignt checked sud
denly by a lariat that trips thorn up
and brings them crashing to eartu;
writhing ropes dance and sing In the
air; cowboys yip, Indians whoop and
the crowd gives vociferous vent to Its
varied emotions.
h.-veul-i Follow Swiftly.
Event follows event rapidly and al
most bewilderingly as the Koutd-Up
presents the sports of rangeland and
plains There Is never a moimut hat
does not have Its thrill as there reck
less roughriders vie with ono another
in the pastimes familiar to 'hut IiIh.
What with bucking and bulldogglng.
roping and riding, relay, pony-oxpren
stage-coach, cowpony and Indian rac
ing and a dozen or more daredevil
stunts that only the mind of a cow
boy could conceive, the audience has
scant time to pause and reflect on
the meaning of It all. F.ir the tin o
being the spirit of the th ng h ild
them enthralled.
Before the opening of the program
the Judges. R S. Dixon of Prtnevllle,
Wm. Daughtrey of Portland and E
P. Marshall of Pendleton, accompan
ied by President T. D. Taylor, rode in
front of the grandstand and were
Introdued.
Oowpony and Squaw Race Kv-itlnR.
As they rode away, burking burnm,
steers and bulls were led Into tbe
arena and sent the crowd Into laugh
ter as they dumped rider after rider.
They were still bucking when, with i
thunder of hoof, flrteen yelling cow
boys dashed up to the Judgiw' stand
i and were off In a bunch In the alway
' exciting cowpony race. It w,i .
