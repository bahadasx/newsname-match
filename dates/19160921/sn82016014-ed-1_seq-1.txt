Olathe. Kan.. Sept. 21. Bert Dud
ley, the murderer of Henry Muller. an
aged German, and his wife, was taken
from the Johnson county jail here
early this morning by a masked mob
and hanged to a telephone pole.
The mob came to Olathe in motor
cars, supposedly from near Stilwell,
where Muller had lived. Sheriff Lon
Carroll refused to give up Dudley and
the mob overpowered him. Then they
buttered down three jail doors. Sev
eral shots were fired, but none was

of an altercation over a team of mules 1

ra.J work. Mrs Muller was killed
when she asked Dudley what had be

Hid Bodies In a Cellar.
The crime was not discovered for
several days. Dudley, after haying hid
the bodies in an abandoned celler,
lived at the Muller h-me with a boy
whoWie hiwl hired to aid in the farm

load of wheat from the farm an in

covery of the murder.
The jury which coveted him was
out only fifteen minutes.
Mob Well Organized.
The. mob was well organized and ap
parently led by one man. It came into
olathe quietly, the lights of the dozen
motor cars dimmed' by coats thrown
over them and the license tags re

Ah rolled Sheriff Carroll, whose
residence is there, out of bed with the
story that a man had been hurt in a
motor car accident. As he came down
stairs, he was seized from behind. He

hands were tied behind his back.
Mrs. Carroll, the sheriff's wife, ran
out a back door of the jail with the
keys and threw them in the grass.
Members of the mob, unable to find
them, broke into a garage opposite the
jail and began battering down the
doors, three of which separated them
from Dudley. Carroll was taken into
the jail by the mob and was a silent
witness- of the work.
Tlirew Water on Mob.
Mrs. Carroll, who was outside the
jail, called the fire department, an
undersheriff and A. G. Carberry, the
city marshal. The fire department
threw streams of water upon the men
still outside until they were forced to
desist by a display of revolvers. The
undersheriff and Marshal Carberry
were overpowered, tied and taken, into
the jail. Just as the door to Dudley's
cell was broken down, some one
struck Carberry in the back of the
head witn a revolver and rendered
him unconscious.
Dudley was taken out and his hands

MONUMENT TO MEN OF

Havana, Sept. 21. Because con
gress adjourned without voting an
appropriation of $100,000 which ne
asked for erecting a monument to
men of the battieship Maine, which
was destroyed in Havana harbor.
President Menocal and his cabinet

The lynching of Bert Dudley at
Olathe, Kan., early today is the first
that has occurred in' Kansas in ten
years. Only once in the past decade
has it been necessary to call out the
National Guard to protect a prisoner, i
According to state records that the
last previous lynching occurred in
Jackson county in 1902, when a man
named Sanderson was hanged by a
mob at Holton. Sanderson killed a
girl when he shot at his sweetheart
who had refused to marry him. The
sweetheart was uninjured. He escaped
arrest but was later captured on the
Pottawatomie Indian reservation,
brought back to Holton that night
and hanged from a bridge south, of
the town.
Fred Alexander, a negro, suspected
of the murder of Miss Pearl. Forbes,
was burned at the stake in Leaven
worth by a mob in 1901. He had been
identified as the man who had at
tempted to attack many Leavenworth
young women. He was dragged
iron the county jail late in the after
noon and the father of the murdered
girl chained the negro to the stake
and lighted the fire with his own
hands. Eight thousand persons wit
nessed the burning.
The records show that other
lynchings occurred at Fort Scott and
Sharon, Springs as well as the activi
ties of he "vigilance committees"
when the state was young.
Nat Oliphant, alleged murderer of
A, T. Rodgers, at Topeka was lynched
on the night of June 5, 1889. How
many more have been lynched, than
the records show, cannot be estimated,
but early accounts of the activities of
the "vigilantes" in the state indicate
that there probably have been more.
The lynching at Topeka stirred the
entire state. More than 15,000 persons,
many of them women, witnessed the
work of the Topeka mob, which was
carried out on Kansas avenue in the
glare of a street light.
Just the day before the lynching in
Topeka, June 4, 1889, Pat Cleary was
hanged to a bridge at Lincoln, Kan.
by a mob, according to newspaper ac.
counts in the library. Cleary was con
victed of the murder of Jesse Turner
on January 3. 1888. He tried to escape
from jail and was shot before being
hanged.
Other accounts at the State Histor
ical society show that in 1883 three
men were hanged from the same tree
at the outskirts of Medicine Lodge.
These men robbed the Medicine Lodge
bank. Henry Brown, who the ac
counts say was the leader, was shot
while trying to escape, and riis pals,
named Smith, Wheeler and Wesley,
were hanged from the same tree at
the same time.
In 1871 a triple lynching was held
near Wellington, where Charley
Smith, Bill Brooks and Charles Has
brook, supposed to have been horse
thieves, were hung by a mob, accounts
show. Smith was positively lndenti
fied as Sewell Ford, said to be the son
of ex-Governor Ford, of Illinois, at
that time, according to accounts. The
newspaper story also says that Sewell
Ford s brother also was hanged later.
Probably the most intense scene
that ever surrounded lynchings in the
state was at Atchison in 1863. library
data show. For an entire week a mob
of farmers took charge of the jail and
tried five men for a series of crimes
and murders. As each man was tried
by the "mob court" and convicted, he
was taken out and hanged. Four of
the five were killed in this manner,
the reports show.
The earliest lynching on record at
the historical library was at Holton,
Kan., in 1865, where Carl Eden was
hanged from the limb of a tree. Eden
was a Confederate, and he killed
Charles Russell, a Union man, follow
ing an altercation, the accounts show.
STATE WILL ACT
Governor and Attorney General
in Investigation.
Sheriff Is Automatically Sus
pended From Office.
State departments will probably
take a hand in the investigation of
the Dudley lynching at Olathe. Both
Governor Capper and S. M. Brewster
are out of the city today, but reports
in the state house this afternoon in
dicated immediate action by the state.
Charles Sessions, private secretary
to Governor Capper, has been un
able to communicate with the state
executive. General Brewster is in
Fredonia. He has not 'ndicated his
action in the matter.
In state house circles, however, it
was assimued that Governor Capper
would tonight direct the attorney gen
eral to begin an investigation of the
lynching. It is probable that special
assistants will be sent to Johnson
county from the attorney general's of
fice to gather evidence in the case.
Whether Governor Capper will offer
a reward in the case or will use his
contingent fund in a probe of the
Dudley case is not known at this
time.
Coroner Becomes Sheriff.
Li. P. Lalhrop, coroner, automatic
ally became sheriff cf Johnson county
today following the lynching of Bert
Dudley. . nvlcted slayer of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Muller, by fifty enraged
Johnson county citizens this morning.
It is provided by the Kansas. 1909
statutes, that when a lynching occurs
in a Kansas sheriff's territory, the
coroner automatically becomes sheriff.
At the end of ten days' suspension, a
hearing is held before the governor
and the deposed sheriff may or may
not be reinstated by the governor. E.

Chicago, Sept. 21. Many promi

breathing: easier today following the
confiscation of a card index case used
by the blackmailers, some of whom
are supposed to be under arrest here.
"At least twenty names were listed
and opposite each was a note of "some
misconduct which the syndicate hopei
to use for extortion," said a detective
today, "all those listed were of promi
ence financially and socially here, but
the names will not be given out," he
said.
Evidence of the syndicate's opera
tions continues to pile up. A wealthy
machinery manufacturer is known to
have become infatuated with a woman
in a cafe. As the romance waned, the
woman told him she was ill and sug
gested he send her to the mountains
and give her $100,000.
Would Tell His Wife.
"If you do not see the justice of
this perhaps your wife will," she
wrote him in answer to objections. He
had the woman shadowed in New
Ycrk and forced her to sign a state
ment that she had lied and absolving
him from further payments.
Another woman hired out as a
stenographer and after several rounds
of cafes demanded $200,000 but she
did not get it when a detective ex
posed her game.

Country Club Tournament Be-j

Unusually Low Scores Made'iu
the Qualifying Round.
Altho the course is rAuch more dif

turned in by the players in the fourth
annual invitation tournament of the
Country club this morning were much
better on an average than those made
last year and every indication pointed
to much better playing thruout the
big event.
The low medal score made last year
was an 84 by Kitchen, of Lawrence,
and at noon today two players had
made the 18 holes with smaller totals
and one had tied it. Those who played
over the course this morning statea
that it was extremely fast, the only
criticism being that some of the
greens were a bit tricky, appearing to
be rougher than they really were.
Altho auite a few out-of-town play

Play Starts Early.
Jack Crow and Frank Scott were
the first players out this morning and
the first in. Flay started at an early
hour and it was soon apparent that
there would be no trouble about fin
ishing the qualifying round. Up to
noon fifty-four players had been sent
away and twenty had turned in their
scores. , . .
Arthur Bonebrake, the local caddy
phenom, made the best score of the
morning play, getting a 79 after a.
very disastrous start. Bonebrake
went outside with his first two shots
on the initial hole and 43 was the best

an 82, which was the second best card
of the morning play. H. B. McGrath,
with an 87, was the shining star
among the representatives of the
Shawnee club, altho V. F. Roby, of
the Shawnee, playing in his first
tournament made a remarkable rec

here, motored up from Leavenworth

The one source of regret to all the
old-time tournament players was the .
absence of J. B. Dickey, of Newton,

EXPOSE SCANDAL
German Diplomats Involved in
Heated Controversy.
Veracity Questioned in Defeat-
ing U-Boat War Flan.
Berlin, Sept. 21. Renewed and full
discussion in the reichstag of the sub
marine issue and the controversy
which led to the retirement of Ad
miral von Tirpitz as minister of the
navy appears to be inevitable in con
sequence of the publication yesterday
of the letters exchanged between
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
and the admiral. '
From these letters the public
learned that in a private conversa
tion Professor Valentine asserted Ad
miral von Tirpitz had misled the
reichstag in regard to the number of
available submarines and the possi-
Diiity or a submarine campaign. The
trtTceVl"
discipline Professor Valentine, but the
chancellor, while freeing the admiral
from the charges, took the position
that the professor was not subject to
his disciplinary powers. These let
ters, however, touched only the fringes
of accusations and allegations which
for months have been circulating from
mouth to mouth in connection with
the controversy.

the chancellor declares unrounded, but
also the declaration that the admiral
deliberately misled the reichstag and
the chancellor regarding the previous
success of the submarine campaign
anct the amount or tonnage destroyed,
and that the foreign office obtained
the correct figures only from papers
stolen rrom tne admiralty.
This account of Professor "Valen
tine's conversation not only reached
Admiral von Tirpitz, but was sub
mitted in the form of an affidavit to
the Bavarian war ministry and formed
one of the subjects of discussion at
an audience granted last month by
the king of Bavaria to a delegation
which demanded a change in the im
perial policy and the sharpest possible
warfare against Great Britain.
Theft of Private Papers Mooted.
In a communication printed in the
Norddeutsche Allegemeine Zeitung,this
afternoon Professor Valentine denies
flatly any mention of the theft of
papers from the admiralty or that, as
charged in the affidavit he cited as
authority for this statement the chan
cellor, with whom at that time he was
not acquainted.
There has arisen a sharp issue of
veracity between Professor Valentine
and the author of the affidavit. Pro

"PLAYING POLITICS" IS RETORT
Laundry Board Says McBride
. Is Not Sincere.
Trouble Started Over Minimum
Wage and Hours.
There is new war at the state house
today. Unless the ' laundry board
adopts the recommendations of the
state welfare commission the board
will be discharged. Unless the welfare
commission approves the recommen
dations as made by the laundry board,
the commission can prepare for trou
ble and the board members will "talk.
Both sides have refused to budge.
Members of the welfare commis
sion and laundry board are seriously
in earnest concerning their troubles.
Paul McHride. state labor commission
er and chairman of the welfare com
mission, declares he will discharge the
uujiu unci appoint anotner in its place
unless the board's recommendations
are changed. Members of the laundry
board charge the welfare commission
with playing politics and refuse to
back up.
Trouble started when the laundry
board refused to report approval of a
minimum wage and recommended a
maximum hour provision with holes in
it. The laundry board says the recom
mendation meets conditions and de
mands. M.Bride is confident the re
port is a subterfuge and an effort to
sidestep. Definite action in the con
troversy is being delayed because of
the sudden sickness of Mrs. Km mi
naming, or Kansas City, a member of
the board.
Appoint 5few Board.
"The commission cannot approve
the report of the board in the form It
was submitted." declared McBride to
day "For that reason it was sent
back with a request that it be amend
ed. I don't know what the board will
do. I was in hopes something reason
able would be offered. But If the
board won't act there is Just one thing
to do adjourn the board and appoint
a i:ew one."
Three laundrymen U. G. Balderson,
Dodge City: JE. V. Johnson, Wichita,
and C. H. Mathews, Topeka are
members of the board. Mrs. C J
Evans, Topeka; Mrs. M. J. McSpadden
and Mrs. Kmma Harding. Kansas City
represent the women, while Mrs. L. L.
Corbin, Lawrence, represents the inno
cent public. A majority of the mem
bers voted for the recommendation as
sent to McBride and the welfare com
mission. "Politics" Is Charge
Now it is charged that an effort is
being made to play politics and to
force a reconsideration of the report.
i iiey are playing politics and we
won't stand it," declared E V. John-
son of Wichita. "We don't intend to
change our report and we have the
backing of the state association in our
stand. I don't know what will be done.
The commission is trying to get a re
consideration thru a member of the
board and the whole thing has
changed from business to politics. We
will light to the finish."
Work of the board was delayed to
day when Mrs. Harding became sud
denly sick at the National hotel. She
expected to he able to attend late af
ternoon sessions when the board will
seek to take final action regarding the
McBride recommendation.
