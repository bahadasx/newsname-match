"Variety is tin- .si«ice of life: that islvcs

Are You Looking Old?
Old age comes quick enough without
inviting it. Some look old at forty.
That is because they neglect the liver
and bowels. Keep your bowels regu
lar and your liver healthy and you
will not only feel younger but look
younger. When troubled with con
stipation and billiousness take Cham
berlain's Tablets. They are intended
especially for these ailments and are
excellent. Kasy to take and most
agreeable in ellect. Obtainable eve
rywhere.—Adv.

SCHOOL HAPPENINGS

All the new teachers are taking up the
work nicely. Ail the pupils seem to

tVei ijtiite continent that all are in for

year which will show good results at
its i-lnso. .May all parents lend a
hand and thus keep things moving
smoothly.
The hifjh school enrollment has al
ready reached the si.\ty mark. Kvery
available seal in the assembly room
is occupied.
We. as usual, miss many former
faces in the assembly room, but arts
plea*-'d to see their places occupied
by newcomers. Anions the new stu
dents in tin'? hi«jh school are: Oleta
Cullile''. ("trace Krickson, Clarence
Kimball, Kva i'eterson, Pauline Kick

Wells. Several new ones have also
appeared in III" various grades.
Kvs-ry one who has either partici
pated in or observed the football
practice on .Monthly and Tuesday eve
ning-. could not help being enthused.
The boys are working nicely and
promii-e to put up pretty good con
tests. They are getting excellent
tackling practice on the "dummy"
suspended for their amusement as
well as profit. Among the players out
were, .losiyn, Sussex, L. May, 11.

The Manual Training classes are
not overcrowded. We cannot help
but wa nder why there is such a dearth
of bo\s at school or where they all

At a recent meeting of our school
board iL was decided that all persons
found loafing on the school premises
after a certain hour of the night would
be pro.-ecuted. We feel that we may
be trespassing by making mention of
it iu the school notes. But we hope
that you will heed the warning and
thus avoid any further trouble. W

election of 1800 found
the country on the verge
of civil war. The aboli­
tionists •were members ol' the
Republican party, and in the
convention Lincoln defeated Wil
liam II. Seward of New York.
Lincoln was not an abolitionist
in the strict sense of the word,
lie later wanted the government
to buy all the slaves. The ''Doug
las Democrats" nominated Ste
phen A. Douglas of Illinois, who
likewise was in favor of pro
hibiting the further extension of
slavery. J. C. Breckinridge of
Kentucky -was the candidate of
the other branch of the Demo
cratic party, while John Hell of
Tennessee was the candidate on
the Union ticket.
Lincoln defeated George It.

Several of last year's graduates
have requested their high school cred
its for entering higher institutions of
learning. Among them were Crace
Lunding and Doris Tillotson for Kar
go College and William llanlt-y for
the University. Here's wishing them
good luck ami a good college experi
ence. Several inure from the same
class are either already teaching or
will begin the work soon: they are:
Zelma Moore?., Ila/.el (.Mutter. I-Vances
Lockwood, Alma Anderson and Ks
tlier Donahue. We are also informed
that Kunice Iseminger is planning on
entering a training school for nurses,
and Merlon Trammel will enter
Jamestown t'ollege We cannot help
but feel proud of these facts lor it
makes one feel that these young peo
ple must have received some inspira
tion for a nobler work .by taking four
years of high school training". It
pays to send your boy or girl through
school. Would that all parents as
well as children might catch the spirit.
Constipation the Fattier of Many III
Of the numerous ilIs that allect hu
manity a large share start with con
stipation. Keep your bowels regular
and they may be avoided. When a
laxative is needed take (Mianiberlain's
Tablets. They net only move the
bowels but improve the appetite and
strengthen the digestion, obtainable
everywhere.— Adv.
