The maintenance of peace on the
border, it was learned tonight.
The American commissioners con
ferred at length today with Counselor
Polk of the State DepartmenL Prior
to the conference, the American rep
resentatives spread before the Mexi
can commissioners a mass cf docu
mentary evidence relating to condi
tions along the border.
Glowing Rerts Discounted
The reports placed before the com
mission by the Mexican representa-
tives have been of a character calcu-
lated to depict a rapidly recovering .
country and to offset stories that cred-1
ited the government authorities in va-;
rious localities with lack of control j
and efficiency. The American repre-
sentatives have not questioned the re-1
ports submitted by the Mexicans, but
much of the data they exhibited today
was contrary to that offered by the
Mexicans.
Typhus Unchecked
The details of the evidence submit
ted by the American commissioners
were not revealed but it is known that
they have covered a wide range and
dealt with social, economic and mili
tary conditions. Much of it related to
health conditions and indicated the
prevalence at various places of typhus
fever end other disease. The evidence
also included statements dealing. with
soiie of the decrees issued from time
to ti:ve relative to taxes and the con
duct of business.
Withdrawal Deadlocked
As yet no direct request or demand
has been made by the Mexican repre
sentatives for the withdrawal of Am
erican troops, both the Mexicans and
ic , .
the question of their withdrawal is In-
cident to the adoption of a recommen
dation of some broad plan for meeting
the border problems.

Lack of Evidence Causes U. S.
Authorities to Release
Hipolito.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO. Sept. 20. Hipolito Villa,
brother of Francisco Villa and his fi
nancial awnt in the days when Juarei
was a wide open town, was released j
from federal custody this evening and j
set at liberty. His arrest while hid
ing in an outlying village several
weeks an was based on an old state
indict-rent charging him with plotting
to dynamite the train that bore Car
ranzista soldiers through American
territory to Ag-.in. Prieta, where, they
decisively defeated Villa. The case
was dropped a few days ago and Villa
was then held by the immigration
board on deportRtion charges. Lack
of evidence was assigned as the cause
for the release.

(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON', Sept. 20. Premier Knud
son of Norway, who, with King
Haakon, was dinner host to the Danish
and Swedish ministers of state in
Christionia, today asserted positively
to the correspondent of the Exchange
(Telegraph in an interview after the
, . . ...
banquet that Norway and Sweden will
never take up arms in the present war
against each other.
"Norway and Sweden," he declared,
"never will enter the war against each
other. A secret agreement was made
between the two governments in the
early days of 1914, isa guarantee that
such a thing will never happen."
But the premier, replied in answer
to a question, that no such agreement
existed between Norway and Den
mark. King Haakon declared that the
Scandinavians are united in their de
sire to remain neutral.

CHAMPIONS AMERICAN
RIGHTS ON HIGH SEA
Calls Shipping Bill Bad, Tariff
Bill Backward Move' and
ChUd Labor Bill "Absolute
ly" Inadequate.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MILWAUKEE, Sept. 20. Chas. E.
Hughes, in his speech here again to
night outlined his attitude toward the
protection of American rights as fol
lows: "I propose that .we shall protect and
enforce American rights on land and
sea. I propose ttjat we &hall protect
and enforce American rights on land
and sea without fear and unflinching
ly with respect to American lives.
American property and American com
merce. We have no unstated policies
no secret understandings, no intrigues
We stand four squared to the world,
representing the United States and its
interests and its interests alone, first,
last and all the time.".
The shipping bill characterized as
"a menace, the. sooner removed tha
better." The Underwood tariff bill he
called a pleasure "that must be un
done if vro are to have a sure basis of
prosperity in this country." He reit
erated that the anti-trust law instead
of being clarified by definition had be
come "more uncertain."
"I must say," he declared, referring
to the Democratic party, "after hav
ing read several of their statutes that
they are the most wonderful phrase
makers on record."
The federal reserve act. the nomi
nee said, far from being a Democratic
measure, pure and simple, was taken
in great part from material supplied
by a Republican commission and a
draft of a Republican bill.
"Whatever salvation from panic we
i have had thus far is due to the en
lightened foresight of the Republican
party. Mr. Hughes said, in connec
tion with the extension of the Aldrich j
act during the threatened financial
depression in the early days of the
European war.
The child labor law. Mr. Hughes
said, failed to protect thousands of
children rt work in many states.
"And you will find that the states
where children are emancipated from
too early labor are Republican states
and that the states where child labor
still exists are under Democratic con
trol." ARE MADE

Globe Is Their Next Stop.
Millions of dollars worth of
mining property- scattered from
pole to pole, and from meridian to
meridian, and the topmost brains
of the great mining industry,
were represented in Bisbee yes
terday when the special train of
the American Institute of Mining
Engineers literally enveloped the
District for the day. It was the
occasion of the annual meeting
of the organization and of the
first meeting in the state of Ari
zona, of which the stop in Bisbee
was bat a part.
From Many Lands
Leaders of tha mining game
from every part of the globe, and
t?;eir families, were present. From
early morning until the special
left Corta Station, last evening at
10 o'clock, there was never an
unoccupied moment for the visit
ors. Entertainment, consisting of
visits to the mines and the sur
face workings in the Warren Dis
trict occupied most of the morn
ing and after the technical ses
sion in the afternoon other trips
were offered the engineers.
Ends With Bancuest
Last evening, at the Warren
District Country Club, an elegant
banquet was served the visitors
by the Warren District members
of the Institute and was ended
only to leave Corta according to
schedule. Following the dinner
several talks were given by vari
ous visiting and local members of
the organization.
The Technical Session
The technical session at the High
School yesterday afternoon, produced
some excellent material. All of the
papers, from time to time, appear in
the Institute's bulletin.
About Munitions Plans
The State of Missouri and not the
eastern coast line should be the loca
tion of the proposed government mu
nitions plant, according to H. A. Bueh-
ler, state geologist of Missouri, who
was one of the speakers at the session
yesterday.
Buehler supports his contention by
statement of the mineral resources
of Missouri, which he says are even
more available there than in the east-
em section of the country.
Says Mr. Buehler: "In case of the
establishment of the proposed govern
ment munitions plant on the eastern
coast, it would be the first point of
attack by a foreign enemy. This is
only one of he reasons why I Deueve
the proposed plant should be situated
in the heart of the country and pref
erably in Missouri, because of its
great mineral resources.
"Some of these resources are an
abundance of iron in and around St.
Louis, a practically unlimited supply
of coal thirty miles away in Illinois,
and zinc and lead deposits in south
ern Missouri which are the largest In
the United States. In addition Miss
ouri has the only cobalt commercial
nickel deposits in the country, a good
supply of tungsten In Madison county
and plenty or steel in East St. Louis.
Of course we are many times nearer
the copper-producing areas than are
1 the eastern sections of the country.
Chemical Industry Handicapped
A further handicapping of the chem
ical Industries and the paint and dye
manufacturing interests of the coun
try due to a lack of manganese ores,
was predicted in a paper by E. C. Har
der of the U. S. Geological Survey, pre
sented to the Institute members for
discussion.
Mr. Harder's treatise explained that
even at the beginning of the European
war there had been a great decrease
in imports of both ores and alloys of
manganese and that since 1914 the
price had risen from $37 per ton to
$100 per ton with ferro-manganese
selling considerably higher.
Said Mr. Harder: "The situation In
the United States at the present time
regarding the supply of manganese
ores and alloys of manganese is one

Plot Is Discovered.
(By Review Leased Wire
NEW YORK, ScpL 20. Rioting was
renewed tonight in connection with
the car strike after efforts of Mayor
Mitchell and others had failed to ef
fect a settlement. Several hundred
strikers who attacked four surface
cars, engaged in a running fight
with police reserves, during which sev
eral persons, including a woman, were
hurt
Dynamiter Nabbed.
Many arrests were made. What the
p'jlice characterized as a conspiracy
to use dynamite in the strike was
frustrated by the arrest of a man who
asserted he was a striking motorman.
The prisoner, it was said, had attempt
ed to purchase explosives from a la
borer in a new subway excavation. The
latter reported the case to the authori
ties who set a trap for the striker.
When arrested at the laborer's home
tonight, after two dummy packages
made up 'in the I'orm of dynamite had
been passed to hlni. the prisoner is al

explosive to "blow up" a couple of

The commissioner Issued a warning
to the strikers that all missile throw

Hope of averting the threatened
strike of 700,000 union workers here
in sympathy with the carmen was di
minished. Mayor Michcell announced
that a special appeal to traction heads
to treat with the strikers was refused
flatly. Preparations were continued
by union leaders for the "walk out"
wihch would paralyze industry
throughout the greater city. The bnly
chance now of avoiding the tie up
Monday, it was said, lies in a confer
ence to be held between a citizens'
committee and the strike leaders.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor and 25
presidents of international union who
arrived here today, had a conference,
