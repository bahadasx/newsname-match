all the evidence was put up to As
slstant Attorney Oeneral Wallace, who
will draw up tho prosecution's plan
with the help of Assistant District At
torney Knox of Now York. The latter
will hare charge of the case In court.
Nearly all the cases Investigated have
a trail leading to New York City.
Another development of this after
noon was Identification by Division
Chief Offley of New York of the man
arrested In Chicago as "Doo" Donohue,
who has been the object of a search In
New York Stale.
Chief Hlelasld this nfternoon told
of the two most popular methods
employed by tho blackmailers.
The first was for one of-tho women
members of the gang to meet the In
tended victim, gain Ills complete con
fldenca und "listen to any proposition
he might make," Tho woman would
keep her pals Informed, and, at tho
proper tlmo they would break In on
the victim nnd the woman, pose ns
Federal ngents, and arrest both.
The second method was tho old
"badger game." Tho woman would
meet the victim, lead him on, and at
a act time, one or more of her pals
would appear on the sceuo as a hus
band, father or brotlier. In some tn
stances u woman would play the
game alone. If -iho decided the man
could- bo bluffed without tho aid of
her fellow gangsters.
