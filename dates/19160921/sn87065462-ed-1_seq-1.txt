What to Do Now
The first thing for. every far
mer and planter to do to meet
the crisis brought on by the boll
weevil is to mow ditch banks,
roadsides and everywhere else
that.any kind of grass or weeds
are growing, and make hay.
Save even the weeds; the hay
from them will taste good to a
hungry cow next March. Prac
tically Every Farm In- Northern
Mississippi Has Enough Rough
age to Carry the Stock Through
the Winter If It Is Saved. .
One year the Experiment Sta
tion cut dry corn stalks after the
corn had been gathered, wet the
cut stalks as they were run
through the silage cutter, and
made a fair quality of silage.
There are patches of late plant
ed corn and cane that will make
much feed.
' Where the cotton has a bottom
crop only, I raccomend that after
this has been gathered,
plants be cut with a mower
raked into large ricks for hay.
, Such hay will give a full, stom
ach to many an animal next Feb
ruary, Winter, Pature
Sow- at once winter oats, rye,
barley, and Dwarf Essex rape
for winter pasture. Barley and
rape must be planted on rich
land or land thah is manured, or
else use cottonseei meal to start
the crop. Rate of seeding per
acre is, for oats, 1 to 3 bushels,
barley, the same, for rye, 1 J to 2
bushels, and rape, 10 to 12 lbs.
The earlier these crops are
sown, the more pasture they
will furnish. Sow now.' Disc
the land and sow the wheat.

This will make an early cash

The Delta planters, can sow
large acreages of alfalfa on buck
shot land in the next three weeks
and get from five to six cuttings
of hay next season that will
make an early or a late cash crop.
Plant a garden before Septem

Has National Encorsement
Every loyal Mississippian was
delighted to see that the Center. -
thejnial Expositinn had received
and i National endorsement. by act of
Congress in ordering the immen
ce goverment exibit at San Fran
cisco and San Diego transferred
to Gulfport and appropriating
$75,000 for housing and . caring
for it This act gave to our ex
position the stamp of National
approval.
This tremendous exibit coyers
a great range of subjects and is
so highly educationaf in charac
ter that it might well be consid
ered an exposition in itself well
worthy of traveling many miles
to visit., A building with not
less than 30.000 feet "of floor
space will bo required to accomo
date it and a solid rain will be
for transportation.
within a short time announce
ment can be made that several
foreign countries will have ac
cepted the. invitation of Presi
dent Wilson to participate, and
that the Exposition will be to a
great extent international in
character. Plans to this end are
being put into execution with
the anticipation of favorable re
sults. . '
Mississippi is a great state,'
peopled by a great citizenship
and is entitled to a representa
tion second to none despite the
fact there are some who have
a doubt a to our ability to design
and place into execution an ex
position that will be a credit to
the state and nation.
The earnest interest and co
operation of all of our people
will make of this the greatest
event in the century' and a fitt
ing celebration of a hundred
years since admission to state
hood. That this interest and
co-operation will be given, I am
entirely confident.

John E. Callaghan, one of
Union County's good, citizens
and probably as well known as
any farmer in the Blue Springs
section, had a good deal to say
about Tanlac and how it had
helped him when he went back
to Witt's store a few days ago to
get another bottle of the med
icine.' Mr. Callahan, whose address
is Blue Springs, Miss., R.-F. D.
No. 4. is 69, years old, has
farmed in this section all his life
and is the father of nine child
ren. .Speaking of Tanlac he
says:
"I've taken seven bottles, of
this medicine, and I'm telling
nothing but the plain, simple
truth when I say it's got me
over stomach troubles I've had
off and on for 18 years. '
"I'd have cramping and sick
stomach so bad I. could hardly
stand it, and I'd gotten so hard
ly anything agreed with me or
gave me any nourishment .or
strength. A lot of things in
the way of vegetables and meats
I couldn't touch at all, and if I
did they would give me all kinds
of pain and misery.
I tried all kinds of medicine,
first and last, and was treated by
doctors, but I never get any real
relief 'till I got hold of some
Tanlac. Before I'd finished the
fifth bottle I got rid of the stom
ach trouble and was gaining
right along in strength and
feeling better than I'd felt in a
long time. I can now eat things
I didn't dare touch before, and
everything agrees with me fine.
'I think Tanlac is the finest
medicine in-the world, and if
anybody wants to know, just
what it will do just send them to
me." -
Tanlac is, as Mr. Callaghan
says after a thorough test of its
powers, without question the
greatest medicine in the world
today. And what people say
right in the locality where they
are known is the best evidence
that can be offered. It is
square, open and above board
each fact can easily be investi
gated and verified.
By the powerful aid of Tanlac
the system is toned up, purified
and invigorated. Nervousness,
indigestion, rheumatism and ca:
tarrhal conditions, headaches
and derangements of ' the vital
organs nave been relieved by
Tanlac in so many hundreds of
cases that its merit is beyond all
question. . -
Genuine Tanlac bears the name
of G. F. Willis and the Cooper
Medicine Company and is sold in
Okolona exclusively by W. E.
Bearden. adv.
