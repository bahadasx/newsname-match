LONG BRANCH, N. J„ Sept. 20 —
Victory for the democratic ticket in
New York state in the November elec
tion was predicted by President Wil
Bon tonight following the receipt of
returns from the primary's yesterday.
The president indicated his belief that
the progressive voters in New York
will support the democrats.
Mr, Wilson sent telegrams of con
gratulation to William F. McCombs,
the democratic nominee for the United
States senate and to Judge Samuel
Seabury, the nominee for governor.
Tlie message to Mr. McCombs follows:
"I cangratulate you most warmly on
your nomination by the democrats of
New York for the United States sen
ate. A united body of progressive vot
ers will be behind yon."
The president spent virtually the
entire day preparing for his campaign
and attending to official business. Aft
er a conference between the president
and Vance McCormick, chairman of
the democratic national committee,
executive office attaches began com
municating with various non-partisan
organisation which have invited Mr.
Wilson to speak before them. Mr.
Wilson plans two trips next week, one
to Baltimore Monday to deliver an ad
dress and another to Princeton Tues
day to vote in the New Jersey demo
cratic primaries.
it was indicated tonight that, con
tinued reference by Charles E.
Hughes, the republican nominee, to
tlie settlement by the president of the
recently threatened railroad strike, has
led Mr. Wilson to determine to de
----------
vote much of Ills attention to his forth
coming speeches to this subject. He'
is expected to outline his position on |
this subject Saturday when he speaks;
to more than 500 business men who
are expected to make a pilgrimage to
Shadow Lawn. Officials said he plans |
to reiterate his belief that society has
sanctioned the eight-hour day and to
point to his program of legislation rec
ommended to congress as the best pos
sible method of avoiding railroad
strikes in the future.
President Wilson also plans to at
tack tlie republicans for bringing sec
tionalism into the campaign, it was
said by officials. This attack will be
based on the reference of republican
speakers to the number of committee
ships in congress held by southern sen
ators and representatives.

COST OF LIVING THIS WINTER WILL
REACH AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE
CHICAGO, Sept. 20—The cost of
living this winter will reach an un
precedented scale ami will affect every
person, no matter what object may be
purchased, according to a table of
comparative prices compiled here to
day. Merchants and producers are
virtually unanimously in a forecast of
further increases in prices which al
j ready have advanced alarmingly with
iu the last year.
Food prices, it is said, vary accord
ing to quality and quantity, but it
is tlie small purchaser at retail who
must pay most. Wholesalers say can
neries throughout the country have
informed them that fall and winter
deliveries will be only one-third nor
mal, while the last vegetable crop
is said to be only half tlie quantity
expected.
Canned fruits will be 30 per cent
higher and canned vegetables are ex
pected by wholesalers to increase 20
per cent in price.
Paper bags in which the housewife
carries home her market purchases
have increased in cost from 95c in
wholesale lots to $1.55. This advance
is typical of all paper products.

CANDIDATE HUGHES TALKS ABOUT
PROTECTION OF AMERICAN RIGHTS
MILWAUKEE, Sept. 20.—Charles
Evans Hughes, in his speech here,
again tonight outlined his attitude to
ward the protection of American
rights as folloxvs:
"1 propose that we shall protect and
enforce American rights on land and
sea. I propose that we shall protect
and enforce American rights on land
and sea without fear and unflinching
ly with respect to American lives,
American property and American com
inerce. We have no unstated politics,
no secret understandings, no intrigue,
We stand four-squared to tlie world,
representing the United States and its
interests, and its interests alone, first,
last and always."
Mr. Hughes' reference to American
--rights was contained in a speech in
which he made reply, one by one, to
what he termed democratic claims for
having aided business, and outlined
the republican program, in so doing
he dealt chiefly with subjects dis
cussed in President Wilson's
acceptance

An elaborate program of entertain

PICNIC OF BADGERS.

present and a very sociable time was
had. Each member brought a basket I
lunch and when lunch time arrived |

were spread out on the grass. This |

The shipping bill was characterized
ns "a menace, the sooner removed the
better." The Underwood tariff he
called a measure "that must be un
done if we are to have a suro basis
of prosperity in this country." He re
iterated that the anti-trust law, instead
of being clarified by definition, had
been made "more uncertain."
"I must say," he declared, referring
to tlie democratic party, "after having
read several of their statutes, that
they are the most wonderful phrase-1

The federal reserve act, the nom

taken in great part from material sup

NEW YORK, Sept, 20. -Rioting was:

tlie car strike after efforts of Mayor'
Mitchel and others had failed to el'-!
feet a settlement. Several hundred
strikers who attacked four surface
cars, enguged in a running fight with
police reserves, during which several
persons, including a woman, were
hurt. Many arrests were made.
What the police characterized us a
conspiracy to use dynamite in the
strike was frustrated by the arrest of
a man who asserted he was striking
a motorman. The prisoner, it was
said, had attempted to purchase ex-1
plosives front a laborer in a new sub
way excavation. The laborer reported
tlie case to the anthortlies, who set a
trap for the striker. When arrested
at his home tonight, after two dummy
packages made up in the form of
dynamite had been passed to him, the
prisoner is alleged to have declared
he bought tlie explosives to "blow up"
a couple of Broadway cars.
