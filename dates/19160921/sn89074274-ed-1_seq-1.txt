Plans and specifications calling
for an expenditure of approximately
$38,000 in new buildings for the
Midland Continental Railroad com
pany to replace the roundhouse, ma
chine shops and coal docks destroy
ed by fire last Friday night and for
^general offices, station and freight
house and also a new concrete
bridge near Spirltwood, will soon
be placed in the hands of the offici

.the Jamestown Capital.
Capacity of High School Taxed
to Accommodate the Students
On account of the large enrollment
at the high school this term the capac
ity of the building i8 crowded to the
utmost. The number of non-resident
pupils this term is larger than ever
before, and they are registered from
all sections of North Dakota, from
west of Bismarck to east of Fargo.
This showing is one that the people
of Valley City should be proud of and
reflects great credit upon the reputa
tion of the Valley City public schools
throughout the state.
Superintendent Hanna states that
with additional facilities and a larger
building the high school enrollment
could easily be increased from a hun
dred to a hundred and fifty larger
than at present. The present enroll
ment however, is all that the .high
school building will accommodate.

Students Pay $90,000
Every Year for Board
and Room in the City
That students coming here from
points outside of Valley City to attend
the State Normal school spend annual
ly nearly $90,000 for board and room
is revealed by statistics recently com
piled. Of this enormous amount, over
$50,000 is paid to families (and two
church homes) for accommodations in
private homes.
A careful examination of these sta
tistics shows that during the last
scholastic year, which opened with the
summer term of 1915 and closed with
the spring term of 1916, there was an
average attendance per term of 591
students, as shown in the following
registration record for the year:
Summer term, 1915 645
Fall term, 1915 552
Winter term, 1916 626
Spring term, 1916 543
Total for four terms 2366
Average per term 591
Of this number of students, 167 ob
tained board and room at the state
dormitories, and 93 board only, making
a total of 260 and leaving 331 students
who secure both board and room in
private families.
But of these 331 students, 115 lived
with their parents in Valley City.
While a part of this number of stu
dents came to Valley City with their
parents on account of the advantages
offered by the State Normal school,
and while possibly all of them might
be included in these statistics, they
have for this purpose not been count
ed. There are then, 216 students (331
less 115) who both roomed and board
ed in private homes and paid in ad
vance by the month.
Counting three terms of 12 weeks
each and six weeks of summer school,
there are 42 weeks in the school year.
The average price of board and room
combined has been computed at just
$5 per week, or $210 for the school
year.
For 216 students this amount would
be just $45,360 (216 times $210) for
the school year.
But as stated above, 93 students
boarded at the state dormitories, pay
ing into private homes a fee for room
ing accommodations. This rent aver
aged $1.25 per room per student, or
$52.50 per school year, and for 93
students, $4,882.50.
Thus the total income to private
homes in the city from boarding and
rooming accommodations offered stu
dents amounts to $45,360, with this ad
ditional sum of $4,882.50, or $50,242.50,
not taking into account students who
make their permanent home in Valley
City.
At the state dormitories 167 stu
dents paid $15 each a month for board
and room (the rate now is $16), or I
$2,505 per month, or $7,515 per term
of three months. For three terms,
$22,545. For the summer term the
rate is $25 and for 167 students would
amount to an additional $4,175, which
added to the amount of the other three
terms would make a total of $26,720.
But there are 93 students who board
only at the dormitory and they pay
$12 each per month, of $1,116 per
month, $3,348 per term, or $10,044 for
three terms. To this amount must be
added that for the summer term, when
93 students pay $18 each for board, or
a total of $1,674, making a total with
the other three terms of $11,718.
This amount added to that paid by
those who secured both board and
room ($25,720 plus $11,718) gives a
grand total of $37,438 received for
both board and room.
Add to this amount that paid into
private homes for the same purposes
($37,438 plus $50,242.50) gives a grand
total of $87,680.50 spent annually in
Valley City for board and room only
by students who come to attend the
State Normal school.
