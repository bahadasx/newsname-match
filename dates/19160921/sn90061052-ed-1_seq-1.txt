GOOD COMMON SENSE ADVI K
Farmer Writes Letter to The
News Calling Attention to a
Com non Practice
The following letter was handed The
News this week by one of the best
known farmers of this section of Mis
souri n man honored by his neighbors
and friends and held in highest regard
by all His letter refers to a matter
that must have come to the attention
of everyone and we believe the great
majority of thinking men and women
will agree with him The situation
described 1s not confined to this com
munity alone but is like that of every
other ooramunity that has suffered
from short crops this year We invite
others to discuss the question in the
columns of the paper ut any time
upon hbl hearers by his genial manner Editor Jasper News
and pleasing personality Dr Clark Tear Sir As I read the many sale
Introduced a number of the county bills and note the intention of the
candidates who were present and each seller to leave this country I wonder
expressed bis imprecation to the voters if thiH be the right thing to do under
for the nomination and promised a existing cirenmstances I have been
raitiirui performance of the duties of n resident in and nround Jasper for
his ofliee if elected I about 48 years and during that time
Dr Martin then introduced Joe J j have experienced some crop failures
Manlove candidate for congress Dr Beveral of which even more severe than
Martin has known Mr Manlove since I the present one
It is not an unusual thing for the
people to become restless und uneasy
during a failure make a sale and go to
some other country Rut is it profit
able I have observed two things by
carefully watching the outcome of those
who go and who stay after a fuilure
Those who go make a great sacrifice of
their goods have a big expense to
make the change and after all find
not the promised land for which they
were looking Those who stay buy the
stock and chattels of their neighbor
who is leaving gather together what
feed they can tike them through the
winter and generally come out a long
winner
In 1882 the writer remembers it to be
the worst failure this country ever ex
perienced during his time In the
fan of that year public sales were
numerous people left just as now
but they came back It would beau
easy mutter to name a doen families
who left during the crop failure of 1H82
or minor ones since then who are now
satisfied residents of Jasper or Burton
County and it is an easy matter to
pick out those who stayed here taking
the bud years with the good They
are thrifty prosperous farmers who
own their farms obtained by careful
appliance anil the nerve to stay when
reverses come A Farmer
