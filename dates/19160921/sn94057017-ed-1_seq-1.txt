What with preparations for
the state fair and the shortness
of the time, the committees fan
ed to get the fair premium list
ready for publication this week
Another thing: It is desired to
make the premiums as large as
possiDie, ana as the finance com
mittee is still increasing the sub'
scriptions, the premiums offered
win De increased accordingly,
Last year the sum available
was $300. This year it will be
not less than $500, and may go
above that figure; so that the
cash premiums will be sixty to
seventy-tive percent more than
last year.
In addition there will be special
premiums, of course, and the in
dications are that these, too, will
show an increase over last year.
With the funds available it re
ains only for the general public
to take the proper interest, and
the best fair ever held is assured.
Committees from Willard and
Estancia got together Monday
ana maae an amicable arrange
ment for co-operation. It was
agreed that the two fair associa
tions would each take as large a
collection of exhibits as possible
to the state fair at Albuquerque,
there to be merged as a county
exhibit; each association to pay
half the expense and divide the
winnings, if any, equally.. Wil
lard is to appoint a man and Es
tancia a man (J. A. Brittain of
Mcintosh has been appointed by
the latter), to take stuff over
from each end of the county,
and in conjunction with County
Agent Harwell as chairman, put
it up and look after it. As far
as possible the stuff will be re
turned for the home fairs, and
thereafter an exhibit will be pre
pared for El Paso.
It was further agreed that Es
tancia will lock up and go to Wil
lard Thursday afternoon, Oct. 5,
and that Willard will close up
and come to Estancia Friday af
ternoon, Oct. 6.
Also that there will be a ball
game at Willard Thursday after
noon and at Estancia Friday af
ternoon between the awkward
squads of the two towns busi
ness and professional men no
regular players permitted on ei
ther side. The duration of the
games will be determined by the
endurance of the players when
players begin to faint from ex
haustion the game will be called.
CHILDREN GOING
TO ALBUQUERQUE
A gay party of twenty young
sters will leave the valley Sun
day to spend a week at the state
fair, chaperoned and expenses
paid. And what will make their
joy the sweeter is that they have
earned it. They are winners in
the various Boys' and Girls'
Clubs of the county.
With two exceptions these are
farm children. The results they
have accomplished are worth
emulation by older people, and
must be very gratifying to the
parents and organizers. We will
have more to say about these re
sults later, and our readers are
warned to be prepared for a sur
prise. A few of the winners have not
been selected at the time of go
ing to press. The list follows:
Moriarty Chester Shockey,
potatoes.

A two years old child of Mr.
and Mrs. Robbins, who live about
twelve mitts southwest, on Mon
day while playing with beans
sucked one into the windpipe
and it passed thence into the
lungs. In such cases there is
nothing to be done except to
maintain the strength and hope
that when pneumonia and sup
puration occur the foreign sub
stance may be expelled by cough
ing. Dr. Mason sent the parents
with the child to Albuquerque,
but nothing could be done there.
Word came yesterday that pneu
monia of both lungs occurred

A month ago there were a
number of farmers in spots
where the rainfall was light who
thought their crops, and especial
ly'their beans, would give a light
yield, but since cutting their
beans a number of them have re
vised their estimates and now
think their yields will be six to
eight hundred pounds per acre.

Miss Gladys Peden and Mr.
William M. Miller, both well
known members of the younger

prise to the many friends of both
bride and groom. Albuquerque
Journal.
Frost is holding off well, and
every day from this time on
without frost adds several thous
and pounds to the aggregate
bean crop of this county, and also
adds materially to the corn crop.
This is due to thb fact that there
are many acres of these crops
which from a variety of causes
came on late and are just now
maturing.
Wm. Hill of Cedar Grove was
in town last week with some sor
ghum molasses of excellent
quality. He raised the cane and
made the molasses. There is no
more wholesome article in the
syrup line than sorghum. Mr
Hill has demonstrated that this
valley will produce a superior
quality of sorghum, and this be
ing true, there is no good ex
cuse for sending large sums of
money out of the valley for
syrups.
