they made no headway.
The blows bepan last nipht on both
sides of the river, but they met with
no success. On the French front the
(iermans penetrated Kome trenches,
but Foch's troops drove them out i:i
(bort ordr*r. This apparently *raa
? reliminary work?an attempt to
feel out the strenpth of the new
Allied position.*.
With morninp a preater effort WM
bepun. This altack was confined lo

ground before the French trenehea was
eovered with corpeoa. Reporta from
the front indicaie that the determina*
tion of the Kaiser-fl troops fleldon ha*
been equalled.
Around Priel farm, where the
Frenrh position nresents an lmmediate
menace to Combles, the battle reached
especial fury. Four separate asaaults
hattered at the French line, but each
time a curtam of fire was set up ar.d

MEXICAN THREAT

Carranza Plans to Knd
Conference if Per

Washington. Sept. 20. Action by
General Carranza that will result in
breaking up ihe New London confer?
ence is expected unler ? the rommission
ugrees without further delay to a plan
for ihe arithdrswal of the Perahiag ex
pedition from Mexico. Information re?
ceived to-day by The Tribune from
high official quarters was that the
Mexiean governmen' was becoming
nioirr and more convinced that the Ad?
ministration w?< usmg the New
London conference as a screen lor
political propaia-anda and that the
promiaa of the I'nited States to dccide
tirst tha question of withdrawing the
troops was not made in good faith.
From what is known of lieiieral Chi
ranza's present attitude it is almost
certain, officials declare, that hr arill
demand a show-down by the American
eomaiiaaioooro. Ha reallaofl that the
Administration is lietermmed that the
eommiaaioo. on which so much has been
staked, shall not be dissolved without
having accomphshed something.
The time to strike, then, from the
Mexiean point of view, ia before elec?
tion, and it is expected Carranza wil!
make the most of hia present oppor?
tunity to force the Administration to
show its hand. Unless. some assurance
il t,M'en looking to a prompt retire
ment from Mexiean soil the recall of
the Mexiean commissioners is believed
almost certain to follow.
The chief heaitancy of the Adminia

due to the fear that another border

charged again and again upon the mob.
