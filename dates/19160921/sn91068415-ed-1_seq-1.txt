HELPFUL FRIENDSHIP.
, (Written for The Review.).
"To have few friends and them well
chosen" is" a familiar admonition, fre
quently heard m regard to the selection
jof one'srrfriends.: This is good advice
only in. part. v The true idea is Hot cor
rectly expressed, or only partially so.
All f riends. sohuld , be . well, chosen, but
no one can have too, many of the right
kind. For one -to limit by preference
the number of friends to a restricted
few may, in the course of time and life's
ever-changing circumstances, when
friends forced asunder bv inexorable
fate and no- longer privileged cJf able to
1 respond to the needs ' or contribute to
the help of each other, bring home, in
the most forceful and unpleasant man
ner, the , fallacy, of this unwise, though
well meaning it.-may be, advice and
preference. ,
But rather "there should be both qual
ity and quantity in all friendship. Neith
er one should be acquired at the expense
of the other. Both jnay be , maintained
and neither suffer." Both are desirable,
both are needful, both are necessary, in
the fuller development of helpful . asso
ciation and to meet more fully its so
cial need. ;
Let us not turn away carelessly from
a'ny who would fill the place of a safe
and proper friend. We may at some
time need them all. Too often when
friends are most needed there is a sad j
lacking' of the needed., helpfulness the
lyirid one has a right to expect from a
true friend. -
With the evil minded and improper
friendships there can be no- safe aff ilia:
tjon. Self regard arid personal safety
demand the most watchful care in the
acceptance of intimate association and
confidential friendship.. With the good
and true there is alone safety.
We cannot always keep the same
friends with us or near us. Time moves
swiftly on and- in the kaleidoscopic
movement of human- affair none are
left, untouched by the rapidly .changing
conditions of life. The friend; you may

might have gladly responded to the
claim of your need had you .not so cold
ly turned from him when he stood in
sore need of you.
Old friends are Constantly passing
away and new ones come to occupy a
new place in our life- Our paths so of
ten diverge, sometimes leading in oppo
site directions and into new fields of
endeavor. Yet there was no faithless
ness to ma.r the memory of the past, no
ruthless breaking of old ties, and friends
of bygone days are not forgotten. When
with us they were true to every duty
and did what they could to help us along
life's often weary way. They conscien
tiously fulfilled every obligation, lov
ingly responded to every claim and faith
fully measured up to every requirement.
We learned to love, and trust them when
in frequent association with them- and
shall ever love and believe in them
though onw absent and far removed
from u.s Their friendship, so gener
ously and sweetly given, shall ever be (
L VTtTi 1
the dark background of .
a bright spot in
our life.
There is scarcely a word in the Eng
lish language more precious than that
of friend. No matter what our personal
relations may be with another we place
first that of friends. When this ques
tion . is satisfactorily settled in our
mind, then alone we feel safe in giving
such a one our full- confidence and en
trusting bur most sacred interest. Love,
the strongest yet the tenderest of hu
man " passions, demands faithfulness of
its object and will often droop and die
before the falsity of a trusted friend.
Whether husband or wife, whether child
or , parent, whether sweetheart or kin
dred, whether neighbor or acquaintance,
to be first a friend is the foremost re
quirement of each one. When the real
ity of a friend is established all other
conditions of human experiences will
naturally -and safely adjust themselves.
When we speak of friendship it s
generally suggestive of certain recogniz
ed social relations existing only, between
persons .with no other obligations to
each other than the natural force of
attraction which draws them together in
congenial association, but the strongest
and dearest friendships in all the world
should be found in the ; home life be
tween members of the same family, for
there it is. often most needed and yet so
often, though maintained in form, lack
ing in the true spirit of deep personal
interest. In the many opportunities for
rendering help arid giving encourage
ment, the center of all that is god, pure,
and true,"- the ' foundation of Jthe whole
structure ia laid " and its principles
