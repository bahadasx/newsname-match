NEW YORK. Sept. 21.?Seventy-live
business men organized as a committee
tried to persuade labor leaders Thurs
day to refrain from declaring a general
strike in sympathy with the street
railway employes, of whom it is assert- j
ed there are ll.OOu on strike. This j
is the last day of grace given by the
labor unions to the mayor and volun
leer mediators to settle the dispute ?
with the Interborou'gh Rapid Transit;
Company and the New York Railways'
Company.
Rioting continues despite the fact'
that 2,000 policemen were concentrated
in the center of the city Wednesday i
night to protect elevated crosstown
surface lines. Strike sympathizers
bombarded cars with missiles. In
one case several hundred strikers at
tacked a car and were beaten off only
after a battle with the police.
Repeatedly during the early hours
Thursday Sixth and Seventh avenuei
elevated trains were assailed by strike
sympathizers on roof tops. Twenty- ,
two such attacks were reported by the i
police in a few hours.
Car windows were smashed under
showers of bricks and bottles and sev
eral passengers were Injured.
UP IN PRICE
And the Smoker Will Have to
Come across with Extra
Change or Quit Smoking.
In these days of everything going up
and nothing coming down, those who
smoke ere about to find tiiat they are
not an excepted class. The prices of
cigars, cigarets. stogies and smoking'
tobacco are to take a big jump and
there will be nothing cheap in these
lines any more, for a while at least.
Local retail dealers are advised that j
some of the leading cigars will be I
raised in wholesale price $2, $3 and
54 a thousand. The manufacturers i
assign as reasons for the raise:
Increased cost of raw material, in- j
creased prices of supplies generally,]
increase of wages just made to cigar
makers and various other reasons.
Retailers who have been selling i
cigars six for a quarter will not be j
able to continue that practice, but will
have to sell them absolutely at five
cents straight to make any profit at all.
Some of the manufacturers have re
sorted to tin instead of wooden boxes
in order to keep down the cost.
There is an inside tip that very few
factories will make the very desirable
twenty-five In a box for the holiday
trade, and Christmas presents of this
kind will be very scarce.
The situation is not at all pleasing
to local retailers but they cannot help
themselves and the public will have
to pay, or quit smoking.
