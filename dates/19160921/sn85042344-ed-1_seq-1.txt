In the face of Mr. Calder's appar

BEGIN REMODELING
Police Officials Believe
Move AVill Alleviate the
Congested Condition.
NO TIME will bo lost in removing
central police headquarters from
Its prcsont location on Second street
between Cheyenne and Boulder to the
old llickok livery building one block
nearer Main etreet on the same streot
and adjacent to fire station No. 4,
police offliials said yesterday aft
ernoon. Work of remodeling the newly de
signated station will be undertaken
at once, or as soon hereafter as con
tractors can be secured and detailed
plans can be outlined. It is expected
that tho structure will be ready for
occupancy by October 15.
Decision to transfer the police head
quarters was reached at an Informal
conference of Mayor Simmons and
the board of commlsloners Wednes
day morning. The unexpected move
came only after the city fathers had
exhausted every project broached for
tho shelter of the department. h'or
moro than a year the present building
has proven entirely Inadequate and
for six months the city prison has
been condemned by stato charity of
ficials as unfit to house prisoners in.
Only a few dismal and Ill-smelling
cells are crowded In tho (station at
present.
The new. building Is unuusnlly large
and spacious with u frontage on Sec
ond street. It Is somo 150 feet deep
and 75 feet wide.
According to present specifications
the livery building will be entirely re
modeled. The front itself will be
gone over and given a dignified ap
pearance. To the right and left of
tho entrance proper offices of the
heads of the department will be con
structed, while in the center tho police
courtroom will be located. This will be
of much larger dimensions than the
one at tho old place and will bo out
fitted In modern furnishings.
In the direct rear will be the Jail
Itself. Besides the present outlay of
cells a large number of tool proof
stool cells will be installed, a section
for male and a section for female
prisoners. Near the Jail will be the
patrolmen's headquarters and the
Uertlllon rooms.
At one tlmo it was the intention of
city officials to nialio of the livery
barn fire station No. 4 and to remove
this station from Its present location
In front of police headquarters, giving
the police department full control of
tho struct tire. Pressing need of new
quarters dlsi upted this move.
