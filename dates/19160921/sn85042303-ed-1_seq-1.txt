GEOLOGIST
COL. PUFFINBERG SAYS DEMO
CRATIC CAMPAIGN SONGS ARE
BEING SUNG IN THEATRES
PEOPLE LOYAL TO WILSON.
Col. J. A. Puffinberg, who is one of
the best known geologists in the
country, has returned here after an
absence of several weeks. Mrs. Puf
flnberg is in Oklahoma City, having
accompanied him that far. The Colo
nel has been in Kansas and In Mis
souri during the summer months and
has been doing professional work in
those two states. He came back to
Ardmore thoroughly convinced that
Woodrow Wilson will be elected pres
ident. The republicans are claiming
that Missouri is one of the battle,
ground states, but Colonel Puffinherg
says It is about as solidly democratic
as Is Oklahoma. Much more thought
Is being given to the campaign there
than here. In all the theatres demo
cratic campaign songs are being sung
and the people like Woodrow Wilson.
They are content to trust him with
foreign affairs and have absolute con
fidence in what he does. They fear to
make a change In such days of emer
gencies. There was a time three months
ago when the president's Mexican pol
ley was not popular, but the results
of that policy have proven that he
was right. He chose the better way
for our own country and for the M x
Icans and the people gratefully ac
knowledge now that the president un
derstood the situation better than
they, says Colonel Puffinberg, and
they are with him to a man.
