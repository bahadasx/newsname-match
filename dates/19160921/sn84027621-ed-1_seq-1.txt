Z. C. Chambliss of this city, who
was recently elected vice-president of
the Florida Citrus Exchange, was
elected vice president of the Grower's
Supply company, and chairman of the
organization committee of this com-
I pany, at the meeting of the directors
of the exchange in Tampa yesterday.
The Grower's Supply company, to be
organized along the lines of the like
organization in California, will fur
nish the members of Mhe citrus ex
change with the growing, shipping
and packing materials they need.
Mr. Chambliss and A. R. Sandlin,
secretary of the sub-exchange here,
who attended the meeting of thedirec
tors in Tampa, have returned from
that city. By a vote of six to four
the directors decided that the head
quarters of the exchange should 're
main in Tampa. The special commit
tee named to consider the removal of
the headquarters consisted of Mr.
Chambliss, F. W. Perry of Fort My
ers, and Carlo Scarlette of DeLand.
Mr. Chambliss and Mr. Perry filed a
majority report to retain the head
quarters in Tampa, and Mr. Scarlette
filed a minority report to move the of
fices to Orlando. The majority report
was adopted. '
Dr. W. C. Richardson, who has been
vice president of the proposed Grow
er's Supply company, and chairman of
the committee on organization, ten
dered his resignation on account of
bad health. Mr. Chambliss was elect
ed in Dr. Richardson's place. The
committee on organization will meet
in Tampa next Tuesday to complete
preliminary arrangements and to file
the charter for the organization of the
Grower's Supply company.
Mr. Sandlin says that the unofficial
estimate is that the citrus crop for
the state will this year run from 75 to
80 per cent of what it was last year;
An official estimate will be published
in a few days. The exchange, how
ever, expects-to ship more frb.it than
it did last season. Marion county's
crop will run about the same as that
fqr the state, according to Mr. Sand
lin.
D. A. Tooke, of Floral City, who has
a big grove near that place, will come
to Ocala tomorrow to inspect the
packing house of the Ocala Citrus as
sociation. Mr. Tooke has become a
member of the association, and will

fruit will probably be the first shipped
from the packing house this season.
