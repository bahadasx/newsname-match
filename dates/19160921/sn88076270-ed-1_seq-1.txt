SPECIAL TRAIN FOR
LIVE STOCK SHOW
EFFORT BEING MADE TO GET
NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS
INTERESTED
Itinerary Will Include Full Day's
Entertainment In South St.
Paul
If sufficient interest is manifested
by the farmers of the north end of
the state a special train may be run
to give them an opportunity to see
the great International Live Stock
Show at Chicago, the classic event of
all stock shows. Local parties are
planning to co-operate with the Great
Northern toward this plan and there
is activity at other points along the
line. The Grand Forks Herald says:
An endeavor will be made to run
a special train of North Dakota farm
ers and business men to Chicago the
first part of December to take in the
International Livt Stock show, De
cember 2 to 9.
A very large number of people were
ready to make this trip in December,
1915, and some 200 reservations were
made with the committee having the
matter in charge at. Grand Forks
when the outbreak of the foot and
mouth u.sease brought about the
abandonment of the 1915 show.
So many inquiries have been re
ceived in the past few weeks asking
if the trip will be made this year ilia:
it has been decided to go ahead,
should a sufficient number wish it.
The itinerary will include a full
day's entertainment at the South St.
Paul stock yards, one day at Madi
son, Wis., or at some well known
dairy farm in Wisconsin, and three
days at the International in Chicago.
The only object of the excursion
will be the study of live stock con
ditions at close range and under the
most favorable circumstances. The
train will be run over the Great
Northern and the officials of this road
are in hearty sympathy with the idea
and will use every effort to provide
the best of service,
M. C. Bacheller and Don V. Moore
of Grand Forks were chairman and
secretary, respectively, of last year's
committee and will handle the pre
liminary details at this time. The
committee will consist of well known
men from the towns along the Great
Northern where interest is made
known in the movement.
It is desired to have an expression
from all over the northern part of
the state and in northwestern Minne
sota at a very early date, so that final
arrangements can be made. The trip
will be made at a cost of not to ex
ceed $70 based on Grand Forks as
the starting point and will include
railway fare, sleeper accommodations
during the entire trip, dining car
service and entertainment at St. Paul,
Madison and Chicago. The party will
break up at Chicago and come home
at the individual's expense.
This price of $70 is not official and
will probably be lessened, but will
depend upon the amount and cost of
entertainment provided. The passen
ger department of the Great Northern
will present figures at an early date
showing entire cost from any town in
northern North Dakota and north
western Minnesota.
President Wilson's
Only Sister Dies
New London, Conn., Sept. 16.— Mrs.
C. E. Howe, only sister of President
Wilson, died in her apartments in a
local hotel early today. She was ill
a week with peritonitis.
The president came here last Mon
day, returning Wednesday to Shadow
Lawn. Mrs. Howe had been too weak
to recognize him.
Mrs. Howe came here from Phil
adelphia early in the summer with
her niece, Miss Margaret Wilson, a
daughter of the president.
Her health long had been impaired.
With her were two sons, George Howe
of North Carolina, and Wilson Howe
of Richmond, Va., and a daughter,
Mrs. Cothran, of Philadelphia, besides
Miss Wilson.
Nation's Death Rate
Lowest On Record
Washington, Sept. 19.—The lowest
death rate in the country's history is
shown in preliminary vital statistics
for the year 1915, made public today
by the census bureau. The rate 13.5
per thousand is based on reports from
25 states and 41 cities with a total
population of about 67,000,000. In
1914 the percentage of deaths was
13.6, the lowest recorded up to that
time. There has been a steady de
crease. The average rate during the
period 1901-05 was 16.2.
MORE SPACE FOR WILLISTON
DRUG
Messrs Bradley and Cutting have
secured from Geo. W. Newton the
room that has been occupied by H. V.
Smith as an office and added the much
needed space to the Williston Drug
Company's store by cutting a large
doorway between. They have not
decided just what lines will occupy
the annex but think perhaps it will
make a satisfactory headquarters for
the "hot stove league'' and the world
series dopesters.

Guard Regiments
Will Change Places
Washington, Sept. 18.—General Fun
ston was directed by the war depart
ment today to return one national
guard regiment to its home station
for each new regiment of guards sent
I to the border.
The Second New York infantry will
be one of the first to return, and oth
er regiments will be selected by Fun
ston. The train equipment used to
transport (troops recently ordered
south, will be employed in bringing
home returning regiments.
The orders issued are in line with
Secretary Baker's policy of sending
all the organizations in state mobili
zation camps to the border before
they are mustered out of the federal
service.
There are 18,000 guardsmen still in
state camps. These will move as
rapidly as the necessary arrange
ments can be made.
ENGINEER MANGLED
HI MM GEARS
JOHN KELLY VICTIM OF FATAL
ACCIDENT NEAR McGREGOR
—LEG TORN OFF
John Kelley, engineer with the An
thony Bloom threshing crew, lost his
life "by one of the most horrible acci
dents ever known in this section.
The Anthony Bloom machine was
working between McGregor and Tioga
and Tuesday evening was moving to
a new job. While his engine was
moving along the road, Kelley climb
ed out on it to adjust some nart of
the machinery. Losing his footing,
he slipped so that the toes of his rijrht
foot were caught between the heavy
cog wheels oi the traction gear.
Powerless to stop his engine or extri
cate himself, the engineer was drawn
into the machinery until the whole
leg was crushed and the muscles torn
away from his side and hip. After
the engine was stopped, the combined
effort of nine men was required to
pry the wheels apart and release the
victim after he had suffered tortures
for half an hour.
Kelley was hastened to Tioga and
received the attention of Dr. Stobie
of that place and Dr. Hagan of Wil
liston. The surgeons were able to do
but little more than staunch the flow
of blood and administer opiates. Dr.
Hagan states that in all his surgical
experience he has never seen a more
horrible case of mangling or more
excruciating suffering. Great muscles
as large as a man's arm were literal
ly torn from the body and some of
the organs of the abdomen were ex
posed. The suffering of the victim
was so intense that he begged for a
revolver to end his life. He remained
conscious most of the time and gave
the address of a sister in Minnesota
and stated that his parents were not
living. Death came at 11 o'clock,
about five hours after the accident
occu2-red.
Kelley was a man about forty years
of age, strong and robust, weighing
about 190 pounds. Not much was
learned of nis history except that he
had a homestead near Wolf Point,
Montana.

BOLLEY HDDS BEST
SEED III NORTH-WEST
SEED EXPERT VISITS WILLIAMS
COUNTY FOR SEED WHEAT
INVESTIGATION
Advises Farmers Having Fair Grades
To Hold And Have Tests Made
At Labratory
North Dakota will require 3,000,000
bushels of wheat to seed the 1917
crop and a large part of it must come
from the northwest corner of the
state, is the assertion of Prof. H. L.
Bolley, state seed commissioner and
one of the highest authorities on mat
ters pertaining to cereal crops.
Prof. Bolley spent a day in Wil
liston and vicinity the latter part of
last week to get in personal touch
with the wheat situation. He visited
the Williston Sub-Station farm and
examined samples of local wheat. In
a long interview, granted the Graphic,
he said there was certain to be an
unusual demand for good seeds of all
sorts grown on the farms for use
next season. The greatest demand
will of course be for wheat of good
germination test. Every farmer who
has wheat that weighs upwards of
54 pounds to the bushel and is in
position to hold it for seed purposes
should send a sample of at least half
a pound to the Seed Laboratory, Ag
ricultural College, for germination
test. Every effort will be made
give prompt service and to bring
those having seed and those needing
seed in touch.
Better Rotation Basis
There is sure to be big demand for
western grown seed of all kinds as
there is but little in the eastern sec
tions that will be fit and the western
grown grains will be best for the
needs brought about by the present
conditions. Field seeds of every sort
will be needed for many farmers will
wish to try a wider range of crops so
as to gradually get on a basis for
crop rotation to escape loss from rust
and other blights so destructive under
constant wheat culture.
Every farmer needs alfalfa, corn,
clover, millet, field peas, sudan grass,
brome grass, wheat grass, timothy,
etc., said Prof. Bolley. "Say to your
readers that every effort will be made
to place those who have good seeds
for sale and those who need seed in
touch with each other." To do that
the laboratory must have a chance to
analyze and test the seed offered and
good sized sample lots should be sent
in as soon as possible.
In speaking of the conditions that
resulted in such poor yields and qual
ity Prof. Bolley said that his investi
gation showed that scab and four or
five other blighting diseases did most
of the damage to the wheat crop and
made it susceptible to the ravages of
stem rust. The older the soil the
greater the chance of disease infec
tion. That is the reason for more
good wheat the present season in the
newer sections of the west.
Farmers will do well, said Mr.
Bolley, to take an interest in the an
nual Pure Seed Show and Contest
that will be held at Devils Lake, No
vember 15, 16, 17 by the North Da
kota Improved Seed Growers Asso
ciation.
YOUNG EASTERNER WHO GRAD
UATED AT N. D. UNIVERSITY
TAKEN SUDDENLY
Solomon Esberg, an attorney who
recently has been associated with C.
C. Converse at Watford City, died in
a local hospital early Tuesday morn
ing.
Monday Mr. Esberg was brought
from Watford City by a physician
and intended to go to Grand Forks
to enter St. Michael's hospital, bat
after arriving here his physician arl
vised that he was too weak to travel
and should go to a Williston hospital
to regain strength.
About four years ago, Mr. Esberg
who is a graduate of the
law
depart­
ment of the North Dakota university,
came to Williston and practiced his
profession a few months. Later he
established himself at Great Falls
from where he returned to his former
home in the east. This summer, fail
ing health made it necessary for him
to again come west and he former! a
partnership with Mr. Converse who
maintains offices at Schafer and Wat
ford City.
Solomon Esberg was a native of
Perth Amboy, N. J., and was about
28 years of age. Deciding upon a
legal career, he took the course at
Columbia university, continuing with
in three months of graduation, when,
on account of tubercular trouble his
physician advised that it was imper
ative that he come west. He took a
year's work in law at the State uni
versity, graduating with high honors.
Immediately afterward he located in
Williston. This climate made some
improvement in his condition, but af
ter returning east he grew rapidly
worse and was obliged to come west
again. He was a man of liberal edu
cation and an interesting conversa
tionalist. During the time he was in
Williston he gained many friends.
Mr. Esberg's people had already
been summoned before he left Wat
ford and arrived in Williston this
morning.

the greatest successes ever scored by
a similar event in this city. The idea
of combining a delightful social af

the benefit fund for Company E, now
on the Mexican border, originated
with several public spirited young
ladies of the city who were ably as
sisted by friends and relatives of the
company members.
The Armory was made beautiful by
a profusion of garden flowers, and ex
cellent music was provided. A lap
lunch was served in the basement and

State Historical Sai
Suggests Corn And
Alfalfa Exhibits
"Why not a state wide school corn
and alfalfa exhibit during Apprecia
tion Week this year'' is the sugges
tion of Commissioner R. F. Flint of
the state department of agriculture.
"If the teachers of the various schools
would set aside a special day during
that week to hold an exhibit of corn
and alfalfa and other products of
their district it would pryvo both
interesting and valuable. Suitable
exercises, programs and discussions
could be arranged and the patrons
invited to be present at the judging.
The best of these samples could then
be sent to the various winter exhibits
at Grand Forks, Fargo, Minot, Bis
marck. Devils Lake, Garrison and
other places within the state. Corn
and alfalfa are valuable beyond esti
mation on the farms of North Dakota
therefore such exhibits are of much
importance."
"But the immeasurably greater
value of helping place North Dakota
before the nation as a corn and al
falfa state would come by sending
exhibits thus collected to the First
National Corn Show at St. Paul in
December.-'
Women To Run Train
In Hughes' Interest
The Republican Women's Campaign
Committee and the Women's Commit
tee of the Hughes Alliance are send
ing across the continent in October a
Hughes Campaign train to get votes
for Hughes. It has changed the slo
gan so long associated with all wom
en's political activities from "votes
for women" to "votes for Hughes,"
and has placed practical political ac
tivity forever above and beyond mere
voting.
This- is not a suffrage train. Tt is
a Hughes Campaign train. It will
carry a dozen or more of America's
foremost writers and speakers and
workers, who have been selected as
leaders in their fields of work in
Americanization, immigration, eduj
cation, protection of women, proba
tion, and not for what they believe on
suffrage.
This train will visit 28 states, as
follows: Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New York, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota,
Montana, Washington, Oregon, Cali
fornia, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho,
Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Mis
souri, Indiana, Kentucky, West Vir
ginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Dela
ware and New Jersey.
It will be met in each state by state
reception committees who will travel
through the state. The meetings will
be for both men and women. The lo
cal speakers will be men. The meet
ings will be presided over by men,
and the issues presented will be na
tional.
The train will be financed and man
aged by women who, by being effi
cient, are thus putting into practical
operation Mr. Hughes's slogan,
"America first."
CITY BEAUTIFUL
PRIZES AWARDED
O N E N E I S IX
CHILDREN KEEP UP WORK
STARTED BY AND
A most successful conclusion to the
City Beautiful Contest, instituted by
the and club, early in the summer
was marked by the awarding of the
prizes to the successful contestants.
Besides the giving of the prizes,
which were fourteen in number,
amounting to $30, 136 children enjoy
ed the privilege of free admission to
the Lyric theatre where they wit
nessed the performance of Cinderella
with Mary Pickford in the title role.
The judges after making their final
inspections had a most difficult task to
decide on the prize winners. The
prizes were offered for the yards and
gardens in which the greatest im
provement was made during the pres
ent summer. The judges of course
kept this fact before them and it was
not in all cases the premises pre
senting the finest appearance that
won the prizes. 136, or a very high
percentage of all who started in the
contest, kept up the work to the close,
and the club feels well repaid for the
effort the campaign has cost. They
feel certain that it will be much
easier to arouse interest next year.
The Winners
The first prize, $10, was awarded
to Harold Keyes. Harold had a new
yard to work with and the splendid
improvement brought about won him
the judges decision.
The second prize of $5 went to
Ellsworth Wattom. The chief feature
of this yard was a fine vegetable
garden.
Third prize, S3, went to the two
sons of Judge A. L. Butler. Three
bird houses that attracted wrens,
robins and bluebirds as tenant, were
strong features of the Butler yard.
Glena Hickman won the fourth
prize of $2 by faithful work in the
yard of a small log house that is one
of the early landmarks of the city, at
2nd Avenue east and Fifth street.
The $1 prizes were won by Edwin
Rickard, Cyril and Elinore Kulas, Roy
Hval, Elizabeth, Bessie and Benjamin
Nelson, Carl and Viola Jewett, Neva
Hydle, Joe and Bertha Shikany,
Vaughn Kelly, Jessie Sween, Hannah
Veitch.
The judges say that honorable men
tion is due the fine yards of E. E.
Hanyen, A. A. Bradley, the Episcopal
rectory, the Methodist parsonage, M.
Stedam, Richard Peyton and May Bell.
STRANGE WAR CRAFT
COMES FROM PEORIA
CATERPILLAR TRACTORS THAT
DEFY ALL OBSTACLES NOW
USED BY BRITISH
Other Nations Buyers—Manufacturer
Describes Land Dreadnaught
Used In Europe
Washington, Sept. lb.—The British:
"tanks," the armored motor cars used
in recent assaults on German trench
es in northern Franco so successfully
as to attract world-wide attention*
were built for the most part in Peoria,
111., in the form of caterpillar tractors
designed many years before the war
began to meet some of the difficult
problems of modern farming.
Except for their armor, their ma
chine guns and their crews, thousands
like them are in use today in the
United States, in plowing, digging
ditches and ether labors less heroic
than war.
lr. S. Army To Be Equipped
The United States army will b*
equipped soon with giant armoredr
cars equal in power and effectiveness
to those now in use by the British
on the French war front.
The ordnance bureau of the War
Department is having built such cars.
The size and design is being kept
secret by the army men.
General Hugh L. Scott, chief of the
army staff, admitted this much to
night. He would not tell of the pro
gress on the work of building the
cars, whether any had been com
pleted and were being tried out by
the army experts, or where the parts
for the cars were being made.
M. M. Baker, vice president of the
Holt Manufacturing Company, ex
plained here today that it was ma
chines made by his company at its
Peoria plant that had hurdled German
trenches, walked through forests i.id
crawled over shell craters in the face:
of intense gun fire.
Germany Purchaser, Too
"We have sold about 1,000 cater
pillar tractors to the British govern
ment," said Mr. Baker. "We have
had nothing to do with putting armor
on them or placing machine guns, but
some of our men at Tldershot, Eng
land, recently were notified that the
British government intended to ar
mor some of the tractors and use
them for work other than the usual
towing of big guns.
"Germany had some of these trac
tors before the war began, and, al
though I do not understand just how
it occurred, I believe she may have
got others since then. We have sent
some to France and some in Russia.
"So far as I know, up until thera
cent appearance of the motor cars
the tractors were used only to tow
big guns. I understood that Germany
used about forty of' them in this
work before Liege early in the war,,
and recent photographs show that
the British are using some of them
now for the same purpose."
Act Like Juggernaut
Mr. Baker said he did not know?
how many of the 1,000 tractors sent
to England had been armored and
put iri service as land battleships, nor
did he know what equipment the
British' war office had placed upon
cars to be used in this work.
"It is true," said Mr. Baker, "that
these tractors can go ahead over al
most anything or through almost
anything. They can straddle a
trench, go through a swamp, rollover
logs or climb through srnall craters,
like a car of Juggernaut. It looks
uncanny to see them crawl alon. the
ground, just like a huge caterpillar..
In a thick forest, if they encountered
trees they could not brush out of
their way, they could easily be used
to uproot them and clear their own
paths."
Carry Own Tracks
Mr. Baker said the tractors sent to
England weigh about 18,000 pounds
each, develop 120 horsepower and are
built of steel. The caterpillar feature,
be explained, is of the utmost impor
tance. Speaking broadly, the tractor
crawls on two belts, with corrugated
surfaces on either side of the body.
The corrugated surface is on the
ground. On the inside of the belts,
on each side of the body, are two lines
of steel rails, making four lines in
all. These rails are in short sections,
jointed and operate over a cotrcred
mechanism that actually lays them
down with their belt attachment as
the tractor moves ahead and picks
them up again, so that the car runs
on its own self-made track contin
uously.
Machine Easy To Turn
The short joints in the rails make
it easy to turn to right or left. The
body is supported by trucks with five
wheels, something like small railroad,
trucks. These wheels never touch
the ground, but run upon the steel
rails. In the ordinary tractor about
seven feet of belt and rails is on the
ground at one time.
Mr. Baker said that the machine
would bridge any trench that was
not wider than the length of the track
it laid on the ground at one time. The
"bow" might hit the far side of the
trench far below the top, and the
"stern'- would undoubtedly sink a
little, but the tenacity of the tractor,
he declared, would enable it to go
ahead and climb out.
The width of track used on the ma
chines sent to England, Mr. Baker
said, was twenty-four inches. He
declared that the ground pressure isr.
about three pounds per square inch
where a thirty-inch track is used, or
less than that of the foot of either
man or horse.
