tor of the Fair association today
cx'endedttnvitation to "all children
of the state enrolled in the public
schools to be guests of the associa
tion that day." Al school children
will be admitted free. This, of
course, includes children of Okla
homa City, but it will not interfere
in any way with Ohlahtu City
school children's day, Friday of
next week.
Viewed from the top of the rugged,
new reinforced concrete grandstand
today the Oklahoma State Fair grounds
had the appearance of a bustling new
boom town in the oil fields.
White tents were springing up in
clusters all over the spacious grounds,
and the men who will occupy them
were pegging away on the finishing
touches in nervous haste. These tents
are to house the myriad concessions
at the Fair this year.
Ready for Saturday.
The F'air grounds will be ready Sat
urday morning for the greatest opening
in its history, and by far the greatest
crowil ever attending on an opening
I (gv is looked for. Fair officials said
this morning that there would lie no
air of incoinpletness Saturday morn
ing, but that the State Fair would be
a finished product, ready for the in
spection of all when the gates are first
thrown open.
Today the interior of the Imposition
building was a beehive of activity.
Scores of exhibitors were bnsy put
ting that last necessary touch to the
things they will show, and before Sat
urday they will be ready for visitors,
Prises Already Given.
One notable feature of the opening
day this year is that in the textile
and fine arts department the entries
already have been judged and the
prizes awarded. Saturday visitors will
see the exhibits with the ribbons show
ing the prize-winners.
The superintendents of all depart
ments were at the grounds today re
ceiving and placing exhibits.
In Culinary Division.
In the culinary and canned fruit di
visions entries will be closed Friday
noon. A fine showing in this depart
ment is expected this year. Most of
these exhibits will come from Okla
homa City, consequently a great many
entries are expected to arrive at the
