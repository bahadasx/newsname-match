Interesting Happenings About the
South Carolina Soldiers Now In
Camp, on the Mexican Border That
Will Interest Our Readers.
In Cum]) with the South Carolina
Brigade, in the El Paso I'atrol District.
The Charleston Light Dragoons are
rapidly becoming one of the best trained
cavalry organizations on the border.
In a recent tost by army officers
the Dragoons came out with a score
of 100 per cent In appearance and care
of equipment, got second place in progress
and equitation, and third in bitting
and saddling. So noticeable is
the progress which the Dragoons are
making that tho Massachusetts officers,
a squadron of whose cavalry is
in the provisional regiment with the
Dragoons, have complimented the Palmetto
horsemen highly. One of the
Bay State newspaper men said to this
correspondent that the officers of his
state hud praised tho Dragoons and
one of their lenders predicted that the
8outh Carolinians would soon have an
efficient and well trained group of
cavalrymen as there is on the border.
The Dragoons wont into a provisional
regiment along with a squadron
of cavalry from Rhode Island and a
squadron from Massachusetts and both
of these had been on the border several
weeks before the Palmetto boys
arived, and yet in the inspection the
Palmetto boys showed up in the front
ranks with the horsemen from the
other states. The Hay State people
praise especially the personnel of the
South Carolina organization and foresee
an ideal cavalry troops after a few
weeks' training on the border.
Always ?t Work.
The Dragoons aae working from
5:30 a. m. until t> p. m., and oven
a. after that hour -the officers and nonHi
commissioned officers are busy studyiug
the various problems laid out 'or
them and brushing up on military
lore.
The Dragoons in company with the
other troops of their regiment arc
having troop training this week and
are undergoing troop tests. They are
having daily training In equitation,

plate field Inspection of the regiment
of cavalry took place on Saturday,
the men and horses having complete
marching equipment.
The first regimental review and parade
took place on last Friday afternono.
Without previous Intimation
the call for regimental parade and review
went forth and the Dragoons
were right on the Job. The regimental
drill lasted four hours, under Col.
Hornbrook the commander.
The Dragoons had to excavate two
feet before beginning to build their
mesa hall. They bogan on this mess
hall 21 days after the other cavalry
organizations but completed their mess
along with the rest.
The officers of the provisional cavalry
regiment are having daily lessons
in courtmartlal work. Capt. W.
Manning of the Dragoons has beer
appointed inspector for the regiment
in the courtmartlal work.
The officers of the Eighth and Seventeenth
regiments had an obstacle
rlda, to which the officers of the Dragoons
were Invited and attended.
The Dragoons have a frying size
"domlnerker" rooster which they
.brought along with them from South
Carolina. The rooster was the gift of
a negro man who worked around the
mobilization ground. It was his sign of
appreciation for several extra meals
from the Dragoon's kitchen. This
rooster walks around the Dragoons'
tents very much at home and every

Col. E. M. Plythe of the First was
a -visitor to Clouderoft, New Mexico,
on Sunday. This is the garden of
the West, being 10.000 feet above the
see. and its fame and beauty attract
rlsitors from all over the country.
W. A. TTorner of the Navy Y. M. C.
. A. of San Francisco spoke to the men
of the Palmetto regiments on Sunday
1 night. An open air stand was erected
between the regiments and four big
gasoline torches lighted up the space
sufficiently for everybody to read. The
Seooiid regiment band furnished the
music. Mr. Horner spoke on religion
as applied to a soldier's life. His talk
Speculation as to how long they are
to be on the border has been started
among the Palmetto boys by reason of
aeetng the long train loads of Now
Jersey soldiers passing through en
route home. The New Jersey boys
were stationed In the Douglas (Arizona!
district and some of them were
ent back after being down a shorter
time evon than tho l?oys from South
Carolina. The New Jerseyltes were
in Jovial mood as they passed through 1
TCI Paso homeward bound and they
ahouted, tooted their bugles and toss- j

Ilaseball games between the companies
of the Second regiment began
this afternoon and will continue six
weeks. Two games will be played
each afternoon. The schedule war
arranged by Lieut. Ortmann of the
German Fusilecrs, Sergt. Kaiser or
Company 11. and H. P. Demand of ,
the Y. M. C. A.
Fotball practice will begin on Fri- '
day. It is hoped to work out an nllstar
regimental team to challenge the
Pennsylvanians. There are several
former varsity men in both of the Palmetto
regimenlu and it is felt that it
will not be anv trouble to turn nut n
winning football team.
The big Y. M. C. A. tent, which was
so popular at Styx, has been telegraphed
for and should reach the border Indie
end of this week. The tent will
he erected between the two regiments. |
Mr. Demand yesterday moved his present
small tent up in front of the two
regiments. The boys have already
taken out all the two cases of books
and used up 15.000 sheets of writing
paper. More has been ordered. The
l.ooo magazines are being passed
around from one to another and are
proving a treat for the soldiers.
Fifty sets of checkers and dominoes
which were brought out by Mr. Demand
are being used extensively. The
men are thoroughly appreciative of
the benefits of the Y. M. C. A. and are
utilizing it to the fullest extent.
The discipline record of the Second
regiment for the first month shows i
only three arrests, according to the report
of the provost marshal of K1 Paso.
Of these three arrests two were for
staying beyond the time limit for
leave, and the other was a case of
mild drunkenness. Col. Springs is
justly proud of this record for his regiment.
While wandering across the international
bridge at the foot of Stanton
street over the Rio Grande river last
night, F. Ii. Smith, a private in the
Duller Guards of Greenville, narrowly
scaped being shot by the Mexican
guard patrolling tha* side of the
river. Tim bullet from tho Mexican's
gun whizzed close by Smith's head
and the Mexican had his gun drawn
and was sighting straight for Smith's
head for his second shot when the
American guard interferred and rescued
the South Carolinian before the
Mexican soldier could pull the trigger.
The Palmetto sold?er was turned
over to the provost marshall of the
El Paso district, who kept him during
the night and this morning turned him
loose with instructions to get back to |
his camp. It was first reported in
El Paso that the South Carolinian
:<s a member of the Palmetto riflemen
of Anderson, hut Capt. Llgon of
that company came to the city this
afternoon and on investigation found j
that the man was a private in Company {
A of the First regiment, the Butler
Cuards, commanded by Capt. Workman.
American soldiers patrol the Amer- J
ican side of the Rio Grande and Mex- !
iean soldiers are constantly on guard j
on their side. No soldiers are allow- i
ed to cross tho international boundary |
to the International bridge. Smith
must have gotten by the guard last ;
night unnoticed and was close to tho
Mexican end of the bridge when a
shot from that guard brought him
abruptly to halt.

There has been a small homeward
movement of troops all along the border
and at the same time more troops

??? :-il? BORDER
BOARD IS BUSY
CUNSTABULARY SIMILAR TO RURALES
OF OLD DIAZ REGIME
SUGGESTED.
General Bliss Makes Dispassionate
Statement of What He Believes Will
Follow the Withdrawal of General
Pershings Troops From Mexico.
New Loudon, Conn?A suggestion
I hat the Mexican government create
a constabulary for border duty similar
to the rurales of the I>iaz regime was
made during a brief session of the
American-Mexican joint commission
concluding the second week of its deliberations.
Apparently the plan for
a joint police force previously discussed
was abandoned as impracticable 1
afti'r ilit; commissioners had conferred ,
with Major General Taskor H. Hliss, i
assistant clijef of staff of the United
States army.
General Hliss, it was learned, made !
to the joint commission si dispassion- t
ate statement of the situation he he- |
liovod would follow General l'ersh- ;
ing's withdrawal from Mexico before ; ,
a properly constituted constabulary Is
created to relieve his troops. It is ! <
understood he pointed out problems in i
the way of an effot to create a border i
police under dual authority.
There is reason to believe the American
commissioners have sought to >
impress their Mexican conferees with
the view that Mexico must recognize
a responsibility for tho depredations !
her nationals may commit on the border
if good relations are to be unimpaired.
The whole questions of creating
a non-military police force to hunt
down bandits in their hill retreats is 1
based on this feeling and it is believed
the suggestion that the Carranza
government undertake this task for
itself as an international obligation
came from the Mexican commission- :
ers.

London. ? Smashing the German
line on a front of six miles north of
he Somnie in France, the British
Forces have made probably the most
notable advance since the AngloI'rench
offensive began July 1.
Three towns, two woods and the
possession of nearly all the high
ground between Combles and the Pozieres-Bapaume
Road fell to the British.
Not only did the Germans lose
these points but the British drive imperils
the Combles and Thiopval positions
on either end of the British
front The gaining of the high ground
north of Commhles gives the British
command of the approaehes to Baptiutne.
Tho advance on tho northern end of
(he front was for a distance of two
miles. Courcclletto, east of Thieval,
and north of the Poziere-Bapaume

road, fell Into the hands of General
