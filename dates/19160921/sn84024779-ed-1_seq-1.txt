STATE WIDE SCHOOL CORN
AND ALFALFA EXHIBIT
"Why not a stale wide school
corn and alfalfa' exhibit during
Appreciation Week this year." is
the suggestion of Commissioner,
R. F. Flint of the state .lepartmen
.of agriculture. "If tlje tachers
of the various school would $et
aside a special day during that
week fo hold an exhibit of cor
and alfalfa and oilier products of
their district it would prove both
interesting and valuable. Suit
able exercises, programs and
discussions could be arranged
and the patrons tn be invited at
the judging- The best of these
samples could then be sent to the
various -winter exhibits af Grand
Works, Fare*
i, Minof. Devils
Lake, Bismarck Garrison and
other places within the state.
Corn and alfalfa are valubale be
yond estimation the farms of
North Dakot therefore such ex
hibits are of much importance."
"But the immeasurably great
er value of helping place North
Dakota before the nation as a
corn state and aifalf state would
come by sending exhibits thus
collected to the First Ntional
Corn Show at Sf. Paul in Dec."
