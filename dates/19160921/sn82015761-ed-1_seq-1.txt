SI THE MOON RISE,
fflOMTHG SISTER"
Forty-five young people of
Williams led by Mr. R. E. Fort
neycf the Forest Service went
upon a very interesting and
romantic expedition, last Friday
night for the double purpose of
"seeing the moon -rise from the
top of ,'Big Sister" and visiting
the old crater in the side of the
mountain.
The party, gotten up to honor
the teachers of the Williams pub
lic school, assembled at the Fray
Marcos and started for the Three
Sisters at 8:00 o'clock, most of
the members taking a short cut
but a few taking the road with
two autos to carry material for
supper which the party intended
to prepare and eat on the, moun
tain side. Many mishaps were
experienced in .traversing the
rough country. Too dark to see
the country plainly, some fell in
to ditches or fell over rocks and
alt bore bruises or scraches when
the trip had been completed as
evidence that they had been
roughing it in a very literal
sense. Oa the way up, the
party became disorganized and
scattered and some wandered on
the "mountain cold and bare"
until gathered in by the "shep
herd's tender care," or by shouts
loud and long and the cheerful
glare of the campfire built by
those fortunate enought to reach
the crater without seriou3 delay.
There is not perfect agree
ment as to just when the moon
rose last Friday night, but every
one of the forty-five claims to
haveseen it rise and that the
sight was beautiful in. the super
lative. . Thots of supper moved
the party to leave the mountain
top. while yet. thrilled, by the
moonlit prospect outspread. The
glowing ctmonre and antici
pated savois sxm to be in evi
dence hastened weary footsteps
and soon the party had gathered
around the fire in festive circle.
Sandwiches and coffee, salad,
cold tongue, cake and dessert of
candy refreshed the party and
made them feel fit for exploring
the crater. The trip down into
the subterranean at near the
witching hour of 12 and thru a
hole leading directly downward,
none too large to admit a human
body comfortably, would not ap
peal to all and it did not appeal
to all of the party of 45. Most
of them went down to the first
landing and some went on down
to the bottom of the cave. It
was rather taking one's life in
" his hands to go down the rickety
ladder which robbers are suppos
ed to have constructed a" long
time ago and . which lacks both
rungs and strength- ' The few
who went down claim to have
been well paid for the adventure.
Moonrise and the erater, the
particular objects of the expedi
tion, having received proper at
tention, the homeward trip was
begun, the start being made
about 12 o'clock.
The route home took the party
by way of the cemetery. The
home of the dead was entered
and the party tarried therein and
members told harrowing tales of
ghosts and "hants" until jSub
consciously the impressionable
felt the presence of the mythical
entities whish do stalk during
midnisht hours.
Sometime on the trip there
must have been some political
discussion. Very little could the
chroniclaf learn about it, but in
quite a mysterious manner he
was advised to ask Miss Spyker

GREEN CORN ROAST
AT BENHAM'S
A "Green Corn Dance"? No,,
but Mr. Benham thinks there
would have been, had there been.
music. i
Thirty people, mostly fronr
William, assembled at the ranch
of H.L.Benham four miles south
of Town, last Sunday afternoon '
in anticipation of a green corn
feast which was underway and
ready at 7:30 p. m The full me
nu, however, was rosted, corn
roasted potatoes and coffee. .
The preparation of this feast'
will be interesting to News read
ers and here is the modus oper
andi followed by Mr. Benham
and his assistants:
First a trench was dug 12 inch
es deep and long enough to hold
12 dozen ears of corn.unshucked
A fire of pine and oak was main- ;
tained in the trench for two and -one
half hours and then thev
coals were removed. The corn
was then placed in the trench
and potatoes were laid in the
middle of the trench. Gunny
sacks were then placed over the-
trench to keep out dirt and then
all was covered with four inches;
of earth and on top of ' thist
a good fire was maintained for - '
five hours. The corn and -potatoes
were nicely cooked at the:
end of the five hour period and
they were then served. The
party got away with 10 dozen
ears 120 good big ears, under
standfour big ears apiece. Is
more evidence needed to prove '
the quality of this feast? - Them.
find it in the half bushel of :
roasted potatoes eaten. ' -V
It was a feast fit for the gods"
Indian gods, say and it was
thoroly appreciated by the mor
tals present
There was some rivalry in the '
feasting, Mr. Benham intimated,.
and in the competitive eating;
Jerrie Lae was accorded first
place with Mrs. Willis a. close sec-,
ond. The party broke up at .
about 9 p.m.and left the Benham
ranch, full and grateful.
Mr. Benham gathered his com
at just the right time and it was
milky and sweet- He has a fine -. i
lot of roasting ears left in the
field which requires'bnly a short .
time now to be fit to roast But
it would hardly be generous to
say more on this point. -. . - : :
Mr. Benham has a considera- , '
ble acreage of field corn, too, . .
which will make a crop with a
little more time to mature..-
I have a' Dice assortment of the?
latest styles in Ladies, Misses and "
Childrens sport and trimmed hats,
at reasonable prices. Aldo ma
terials and trimmings to make and
trim hats to order. I invite you
to call and inspect any time. Wil'
not have a special opening day." "
