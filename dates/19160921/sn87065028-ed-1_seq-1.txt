to farmers throughout the state have
not deleteriously. affected its atten
dance, the institution having inaugi
urated its thirty-second annual ses
sion Tuesday with a larger numbet
of students than were ever before
present on an opening day.
Students began to arrive in goodly
numbers Sunday and on Monday
and Tuesday practically every train
which reached the city added to the
number, more than two hundred hav
ing arrived on one train. The process
of matriculation is being carried on
as rapidly as possible, but it is neces
sarily slow work, and not more than
75 per cent of the young ladies who

than five hundred names on this reg)
ister, and the three hundred pros
pective students who are now on the
ground waiting to matriculate will
run the number up to fully eight
hundred.
The large number of letters re-J
ceived by President Whitfield duringi
the summer indicated a recordbreak
ing attendance, and for several
weeks past arrangements to accom
modate the young ladies have beer
in progress. With this end in vievf
the executive some time ago ga(
notice that dormitory accommoda
tions for teachers would be material
ly reduced, the number being limited
to one on each floor of the several
buildings devoted to sleeping apart
ments, and remaining members of
the faculty have been forced to seek
lodgings elsewhere. The campus if
surrounded by a large number of at
tractive boarding houses, and not
only the majority of the instructor?
but more than one hundred student;
will be compelled to seek domage
therein, as it . will be utterly impos
sible for all of them to secure lodg
ings in the college dormitories.

ENUMERATION OF PROF NASH
BRINGS NUMBER UP TO
STANDARD OF 1912.
The second enumeration of educa-
ble children within the borders of
Lowndes County shows an increease
of something like 3,000 over the
original count, the loss of about $20,-
000 from the State school fund
which would have followed had the
first count been accepted as official
will not ensue.
Satisfied that the first enumera
tion wa4 erroneous and incomplete,
the board of supervisors employed
Prof. S. M. Nash, who for twenty
years served as county superinten
dent of education and who is thor
oughly familiar with condition;
among both schools and school chil
dren, to make a second count, and
he succeeded in finding a large num
ber of adolescents of educable age
who were overlooked by the gentle
men who originally acted as enum
erators. Mr. Clay Lisle, business" manager
of the A. A. M. College Reflector,
was in the city on business Tuesday.
TO BE IGNORED
To be Treated aa the Cinderel
la in the Household of the
Federal Union.
Washington, Sept. 20. If the
logic of the Republican campaign
committee's amazingly sectional at
tacks on southern congressman and
the southern states should be applied
by a Republican administration (and
there would be no escape from it?
application if the Democrats lose the
presidency and the congress in No
vember) the political isolation of the
south will be attempted and mayhap
accomplished. The whole drift and
meaning of Republican attacks op
southern congressmen and the south
is set unmistakably in that direction
The political isolation of the south
would necessarily imply its casting
off again in the matter of general
legislation by the congress as in mat
ters having to do with the purely ad
ministrative affairs of the nationa'
government.
It is admitted and publicly pro
claimed by Republican campaign
managers that henceforth the south
shall be kept in the foreground a
an issue in the campaign, harshet
things than have yet been saidy about
the south and its influence on na
tional legislation will be heard when
Candidate Hughes enters the middle
west the coming week. He has been
told that the Routh is the old man of
-the sea of the Wilson administration
And that it is iitt'io him to inflame
fh northern b';J''4jk'l
slogan. This sectional issue Is wel
comed by Candidate Hughes, who
find3 in its adoption by the Republi
can campaign committee a vindica
tion of his "bloody flag" speeches in
thn far northwest and on the Pacific
coast.
The political isolation of the south
would have another meaning besides
being treated as the Cinderella if1
the household of the Federal Union
Merely isolating the south politically
would not suffice to "make the pun
ishment fit the crime" of its partici
pation in governmental affairs under
a Democratic administration and
the influence in congress of southern
men, many of whom hold important
committee chairmanships by virtue
of the Republican established rult
of seniority.
The south must also be made to
suffer for the ascendency of the
Democratic party. It must be hu
miliated as a section and pillorieci
publicly as a group of states.
Just how these punitive measure;
shall be applied may be left to the
machinations of Republican partisans
dominated by such men as Chairman
Pons of the Republican campaign
publicity committee; Senator Smoot
of Utah, Senator Penrose of Penn
sylvania and Senator Gallinger of
New Hampshire. They may be trust
ed to see to it that the south is prop
erly haried and disciplined not alone
for its geographical division, but foi
the effrontery of its public men in
speaking their voices and casting
their votes in the shaping and enact
ing of national legislation.
For that crime, committed under
the guarantee and in Btrict conform
ity with provisions of the federal
constitution, the south will, in the
event of a Republican administratior
be made a scapegoat to satisfy the
flaming passions of sectional agita
tors like Candidate Hughes. Repre
sentative Fosa of Ohio, a former col
lege president; Senator Smoot, of
Utah, whose right to a seat in the
United States Senate was challenged
by that great body and whose ere
dentials were accepted only after ar
exhaustive investigation ; Senator
Penrose, the burly boss of Pensyl
vania; Senator (Jallinger, who stil'
imagines that there is no United
States outside the boundaries of the
territory which included New Eng
land in the original 13 colonies.
Not only are native sons ano1
daughters of the south aghast at
these assaults by Republican cam
paign managers and speakers, but
unprejudiced men and women of
other sections are amazed at Urn
eleventh hour flare-up of the fire
of sectionalism. Fair-minded and
patriotic men and women are asking
one another what is going to come
out of this senseless hue and cry
against the south as a section.

PLANT FOR B GUN
GflTTon io sum up sum
MACHINERY BEING INSTALLED
AND OPERATION WILL
BEGIN SHORTLY.
Columbus now has one of the few
factories in the South devoted to the
production of war munitions, a plant
for the manufacture of gun cotton
hcvrng recently been established
here. The plant is owned by J. D.
Kennedy & Son, formerly of Mem
phis, Tenn., and will soon be reudy
to begin operations.
The plant has been .established
for the purpose of treating linters
with a preparation that places them
in condition to receive and absorb
t!;e nitrate which transfers them into
?un cotton. These linters will be
rt3rcd from oil mills ib Columbu
and surrounding towns, and the plant
will run both night and day, its reg
ular output being one hundred tons
of the finished product each month.
While, only linters will be used for
the present, what is known as
"shoddy" plant will later be installed
for the purpose of converting old
paper, rags and other similar ma
terial into gun cotton. The concern
will start out with about fifty labor
ers on its payroll, but after contem
plated additions are made the num
ber of employes will be materially
increased.

Of
BLACKS LEAVING LOWNDES BY
THE HUNDREDS FOR
NORTHERN CITIES.
The exodus of negroes from Col
umbus and the contiguous territory
is assuming alarming proportions,
and if it keeps up much longer local
farmers and others who employ la
borers will be called upon to face a
decidedly serious situation. Fifty
blacks are said to have left Colum
bus on one train a few nights ago
and hundreds have preceded them.
while, according to rumor, additional
hundreds are preparing to follow
them just as soon as they can raise
sufficient funds to purchase trans
portation.
It will be remembered that a laboi
agent visited Columbus several
weeks ago, and was preparing to take
a large party of negroes away with
him when h is scheme was nipped in
the bud by a number of nrominent
citizens and emphatically informed
the nomadic searcher after toiler?
that such proceedings would not ln
tolerated in this community.
The exodus of negroes is beinc
caused largely by the demand for
unskilled labor in the north, and
Columbus is by no means the only
Southern city that has suffered. The
numerous munition plants that have
been established at various places
north of Mason and Dixon's line ha
created a demand for labor that the
local supply can not furnish; an"
employers, taking advantage of thi
fact that poor crops and other un
favorable conditions have thrown
many Southern negroes temporarily
out of employment, art inducing
them to go North, where lucrative
jobs are promised. Birmingham,

St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and
Rev. W. L. Puren, pastor of the First

i-ublic school trustee, was invited to
deliver an address and had accepted
the invitation, but was kept so busy
receiving stu-Ients at the jnstitutinr
over which he presides, which openee
its regular session Tuesday, that h
found it impossible to fill the engage
ment. The attendance at the public
schools has increased so rapidly ilur
ing the past few years that additional
ticcomrnodatiotis have beeorie l-i
lutely necessary, and the people have
provided for these accommodation
by voting bonds in the sum of $50,
000 for the erection and equipment
of a high school building. The old
Stephen D. Lee homestead on Nortb
Seventh street has been purchased
as a site for the school, and plant
have been drawn by Architect J. P
Krouse, of Meridian. The contract
for the construction of the buildinp
has not yet been awarded, however
and it will therefore be several
months before it is completed and
ready for occupancy.
Prof. W. V. Frierson is the effi

Various Patriotic Organisa
tions Meet Tonight to Ar
range a Program.
An enthusiastic meeting of the
newly urganued camp of the Sons
of Confederate Veteran was held at
the city hall Monday nikjht, at which
lime officers not elected at a former
meeting held last week were named
and other important business w:s
transacted. A commander and adju
tant were elected at the former meet
ing and the officers named Monday
nikrht wer as follows: First Lieu
tenant commander, I. I. Kaufman;
second lieutenant-commander, C. B.
Smith; surgeon, Dr. J. W. Lipscomb;
ounrtermaster, Geo. O. Senter; chap
lain, Rev. W, S. Slack; color sar
eeant, Jno. A. Morton; historian,
Dabney Lipscomb.
The election of Prof. Dabney Lips
comb as historian made it necessary
to select a man to succeed him as
temporary adjutant, he having been
selected for that position at the ini
tial meeting of the camp, and Mr.
Davis Fatty was named to succeed
him.
At the initial meeting of the camp
a committee was appointed to solicit
new members, and on Monday night
a second committee was named.
These two bodies will engage in a
contest to- see which can secure the
largest number of members. The
committee named Monday night con
sists of Prof. W. V. Frierson, Messrs.
C B. Smith. E. A. Stanley, F. l.
Ellis, J. R. Randle, Davis l'ntty and
E. E. Richards. The original com
mittee consists of Messrs. M. C. Van
diver, Brooks McGowan, George O.
Senter, R. K. Johnston, J. B. Wil
liams, Jno. A. Morton and I. I. Kauf
man, and each of these two bodies
will make an earnest effort to xecure
as many members as possible.
Another meeting will be held
Thursday night, the purpose of
which is to arrange for the entertain
ment of the Mississippi Divwion,
United Confederate Veterans, which
is to hold its annual reunion here in
November, and in addition to the
Sons of Veterans, members of Ishamj
Harrison Camp, No. 27, United Con
federate Veterans, and Stephen D.
Lee Chapter, Daughters of the Con
federacy will participate in this
gathering.
The new camp starts out under
most auspicious conditions, as the
address recently delivered here by
Gen. N. B. Forrest, adjutant-general
of the organization, was very inspir
ing, while the selection of Hon. B. A.
Lincoln as commander has awakened
much interest, Major Lincoln betng
one of the best known men in the
county and being extremely popular
in business, political and fraternal
circles.
SLIGHT RECESSION TAKES
PLACE l COTTON PRICES
SESSION YESTERDAY BROUGHT
DECLINE OF FROM 7
TO 10 POINTS.
After having scored a decided ad
vance on Tuesday, the cotton market
weakened yesterday, and there was
a slight decline in prices, the net loss
on the day having ranged from 7 to
10 points. The short crop, however,
will necessarily force consumers to
pay good prices for the staple, and
while temporary declines will doubt
loss be experienced throughout the
fall and winter, the general trend of
the market is practically sure to be
upward.
At the close of business yesterday
afternoon New York spots were
quoted at 15.80, December futures
in New York at 16 cents. New Or
leans spots at 15.38 and December
futures in New Orleans at 15.68. In
the local market good middling was
quoted at 15 cents.
