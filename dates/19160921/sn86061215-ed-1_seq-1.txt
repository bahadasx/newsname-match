GERMAN LEADER GALLS
FOR RUTHLESS WARFARE
Head of the National Liberal Party In
sists That No Means of Defense
Shall Be Neglected.
Berlin, Sept. 20.—MaJ. Ernst Baa
serrnqn, leader of the national liberal
party, in a keynote speech delivered on
Monday before his constituents In the
Saarbruecken district, declared that
the submarine campaign had been
postponed and not abandoned. Maj.
Baserman advocated the widest pos
sible use of both submarines and Zep
pelins and the most ruthless methods
of warfare.
The national liberal leader asserted
that his views were shared by Admir
al von Tirpitz, Admiral von Koester,
Prince von Buelow and Count Zeppel
in. He maintained that "in a strug
gle wherein the existence of Germany
is at stake the most rathless use of
all possible weapons is called for."
This sentiment was heartily applauded
by his audience. "Submarines and
Zeppelins," continued Maj. Basser
mann, "were the most effective weap
ons against our arch enemy, England."
Referring to the United States, Maj.
Bassermann warned his hearers
against trusting for any permanent ef
fect on American sympathies to Eng
land's blacklist polloy and the achieve
ments of the Deutsohland and other
commercial submarines. He warned
them also not to hope that t^e pres
ent American protests to England
would have any greater effect than
their predecessors.
VON TIRP1TZ ANGERED.
Berlin, Sept. 19.—(Delayed)—Ad
miral von Tlrpltz has been aroused by
charges brought against him by Prof.
Valentin that he furnished incorrect
information to the relchstag during
the submarine controversy. Prof. Val
entin is employed in the foreign of
fice and the papers print letters which
passed between Admiral yon Tirpitz
and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
in regard to the affair.
From the letters It appears that in
a private conversation Prof. Valentin
asserted that Admiral von Tirpits had
misled the reichs \g in regard to the
number of avalla* submarines and
the possibility of a submarine cam
paign.
The admiral demanded that the
chancellor discipline Prof. Valentin.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, In
his reply, frees Von Tirpitz from Val
entin's charges but decides that the
professor is not subject to his disci
plinary powers.

Britons Take Precautions Against
Losing Shipping Business After

London, Sept 9.—'Correspondence

The recent move by the admiralty in

WILL REPLY TO
E
President Wilson Plans to
Deliver Speeches Upon
Railroad Issues
Long Branch, N. J., Sept 20.—Presi
dent Wilson and Vance C. McCormlck,
democratic national chairman, map
ped out here today a program for meet
ing the campaign attacks of Charles B.
Hughes on the railroad eight hour law.
Asserting that the democrats would
show that the president placed before
congress a complete program to meet
the recently threatened strike by the
railroad employes, Mr. McCormlck
said that Mr. Wilson is prepared to
urge strongly during the next session
of congress the enactment of this pro
gram.
When the entire plan of the presi
dent is fully understood, the people of
the -country will Join in praising Mr.
Wilson, the chairman asserted. The
republicans, he declared, seem to ig
nore everything in the program except
the one item passed by congress. Mr.
McCormlck added that it would be
shown clearly how the president plans
to minimize the possibility of a repe
tition of the railroad situation which
arose recently.
Stone Outlines Reply.
Chicago, Sept. 20.—"A word about
the so-called eight hour law as relat
ed to railroad operatives," by William
J. Stone, U. S. senator from Missouri,
was issued by the western national
democratic headquarters here today.
Accompanying the statement was an
assertion that 8enator Stone was rep
resenting the thought of the adminis
tration on the subject. The statement
said in part:
"Messrs. Hughes, Roosevelt, Root,
Lodge, Penrose, Crane, Pierpont Mor
gan, George W. Perkins and that en
tire genus maintain that the president
and congress surrendered to force and
thereby discredited public authority
and weakened the foundation of our
governmental institution.
"One weakness about this charge is
that it is false. Nobody threatened, the
president or congress nobody de
manded anything of them. There was
no controversy between the govern
ment and the railroad employes, nor
between the government and the rail
road managements. The controversy
was purely industrial.
Nation Facing Tleup.
"The trouble had reached a point so
acute that these hundreds of thousands
of men were on the verge of a strike
they were about to quit work and thus
leave the entire railroad transporta
tion of the country tied up for an in
definite period."
The statement then points out that
while the crisis existed, senators and
representatives and members of the
administration were receiving com
munications from all sections of the
country, indicating that "the public
Bentlment almost universally favored
any reasonable means of averting this
catastrophe."
The senator pointed out the possible
effects of a strike on the fruit growers
of the far west, on feeders of live
stock, farmers shipping grain on con
tracts, manufacturers of steel and tex
tiles under contract to be shipped, on
the fuel supply of the country and on
the mining and timber Industries and
their allied interests and dependents.

CREEKS SEIDDITIHITIIM
TO KIISER SltS RUMOR
War is Hinted at If Soldiers Taken at
Kavala Are Not Returned From
German/ Speedily.
Athens, Tuesday, Sept 19.—Via Lon
don, Sept 20.—(Delayed)—There is
reason to believe that the Greek gov
ernment has sent an ultimatum to Ger
many and Bulgaria, expiring Wednes
day night, demanding the Immediate
return of the soldiers taken prisoner
at Kavala.
When the Greek seaport of Kavala
was entered by German and Bulgarian
troops the city was garrisoned by the
fourth Greek army corps. According
to an official statement issued by
Berlin, the entire corps, consisting of
20,000 men, asked the German com
mander for food and shelter and pro
tection against the entente forces. The
statement said that to prevent any
breach of neutrality the Greek soldiers
would be transported to Germany, to
be kept there as guests of the nation.
The German account of the affair
differs radically from that given out
at the allied oapltals and from stories
sent out from Athens. The number
of soldiers transported to Germany,
according to these versions, was less
than a thousand, one account placing
the total at seventy officers and 800
men. The remainder of the garrison
Is variously Bald to have been trans
ported to Salonikl by the French
auththorltles and to be encamped on
the Island of Thasos.t A recent dis
patch from Athens reported the arriv
al of some members of the Kavala gar
rison in the Greek capital but no num
bers were given.
The incident caused a profound sen
sation in Greece and the action of the
Germans was bitterly denounced by
the pro-ally party. Immediately after
Premier Kalogeropoulos took office,
Athens dispatches said, he Intended to
demand the return of the Greek sol
diers from Germany and that refusal
of this demand would be the signal
for the entry into the war of Greece
on the side of the entente.
STRIKE SEEMS CERTAIN
New York Street Car Men to Be
Joined by Thousands of Work
ers Who Are In 8ympathy.
New York, Sept. 20.—Despite at
tempted intervention of a committee
of business men, there seemed to be
little prospect today of averting a gen
eral strike in sympathy with the
street railway employes. Labor lead
ers aver that the proposed general
walkout will involve about 700,000
workers in all trades!
A second conference of the business
men with the mayor and chairman of
the public service commission was
called today.
Union leaders have promised to
withhold their order for a sympathetic
strike until after Thursday.
The attempt to operate surface cars
last night resulted in the worst riot
ing since the strike began.
Throughout the night elevated and
subway trains were subjected to al
most ceaseless bombardments of bot
tles and bricks, car windows being
shattered and passengers Injured. To
day there were several attacks and
police reserves were repeatedly called
out.
With the arrival here today of Sam
uel Gompers, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, to attend the
funeral of Seth Low, it was learned
that the business interests which are
endeavoring to avert a sympathetic
strike had invited Mr. Gompers to at
tend their meeting with labor leaders
tomorrow. Mr. Gompers held his ac
ceptance of the invitation in abeyance
pending talks with union leaders.
N. Y. PROGRESSIVES
ENDORSE WHITMAN
New York, Sept. 20.—Incomplete re
turns from yesterday's primary elec
tion in New York fail to decide the
fight for the republican nomination for
the U. S. senate between Robert
Bacon, former ambassador to France,
and William Calder of Brooklyn, a
former member of congress. The
vote in 4,303 out of a total 5,719 gave
Calder today a majority of 4,661, but
Bacon's campaign managers hoped
that later returns from outside New
York City would wipe out this lead.
Mr. Bacon was endorsed by Col.
Theodore Roosevelt and many promin
ent republicans.
Republican leaders today attached
great significance to the success of
Gov. Whitman In winning the progres
sive nomination for governor over
Samuel Seabury, who was unopposed
for the democratic nomination for
that office. The 3,680 dlstrlots thus far
counted give Whitman 9,408 to Sea
bury's 6,846. The governor ran ahead,
according to these returns, both In and
out of New York City.
Republican leaders declare that
Whitman's victory In the progressive
primaries proves that the bulk of the
progressive vote In New York state
will be republican at the coming na
tional election.

OTTUMWA COURIER, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1916 NUMBER
Sunday School Meeting Has
Good Talks as Feature
of the Sessions
The many delegates and visitors at
the Wapello county Sunday school
convention, now in full swing at the
First Presbyterian church, are being
treated to numerous good talks on the
various methods for best obtaining the
desired end of the church school.
Workers both local and from outside
the Immediate community are giving
their views based on Btudy and experi
ence in the work as to how the best
results may be obtained. Interest is
general and the various participants
in the convention are showing a zest
in the work of the sessions which
close this evening. One of the chief
addresses of the convention was that
of Dr. W. B. LaForce on The Import
ance of the Sunday School.
In the address Tuesday evening,
The Call to Service, by Miss Elizabeth
Dean of Newon, one of the state work
ers, she explained how the activities
of the pupils in the graded lessons so
aroused their Interest that they would
not leave the Sunday school in the
teen ages.
She showed how the different de
partments and grades of the church
school call for such varied talents that
there is a wide field for service, and
a call for a service in some line by
every Christian.
She began with the cradle roll and
gave instances how parents were con
verted and led into deeper spiritual
life through the superintendent of the
cradle roll.
For the primary and junior grades
she gave concrete examples of object
lessons and how to arouse Interest by
having the children do things.
She stated that young people are
materially so active that they are
bound to do something and that the
Sunday school has the opportunity of
determining In large measure what
that something shall be. "Enough is
known of the laws of the child mind
and child life that the Sunday school
can act with practical certainty in se
curing and retaining the child's Inter
est if it Is so desires. The laws have
been discovered and proven and meth
ods devised for demonstrating them.
Schools are doing it successfully. The
officers and teachers of any school can
do the same by studying the literature
or the subject and then work accord
ing to these proven laws and methods,"
said she.
Along this line of learning, what
other good successful schools are do
ing, Miss May Ditch of the public
library had on exhibition a large num
ber of books and charts from the
library on Sunday school work.
Miss: Ditch is an enthusiastic and
successful Sunday school worker in
the county. Those desiring help on
any line of their work can secure very
helpful suggestions for this work form
her, especially as to the literature
bearing on the subject.
The other exhibits were from the
Plymouth Congregational and the
First Baptist and Finley Avenue Bap
tist schools, showing examples of work
by pupils illustrating their lessons and
the work done in the week day vaca
tion sible school.

day down there," said the general.
