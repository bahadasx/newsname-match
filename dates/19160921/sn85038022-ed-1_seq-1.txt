SEPARATE SKIRTS
Notably Ahead of the Fashions
Maybe it is the way the entire skirt is cut, or the new shape of the pockets. Possibly the girdle
is different and a later style than those usually seen. But no matter which of these skirts a woman may
fancy most, she can be well assured that the tailoring is all that it should be and that the skirt itself is
unmistakably correct in its style. $5 to $15.
CHILDREN'S TUB FROCKS
The last we had went quickly so we hurry more in. Crisp and new, each one as pretty as its
prospective owner. Sizes 4 to 14 years. Prices 50c to $1.50.

"Please Don't Show Me
More Dresses"
said one of Maysville's charming ladies the other day, after she
had selected three pretty models for herself and a coat. She did
not want to be tempted to buy any more.
Every day we are receiving some new dresses, coats, suits
and skirts, and every day we are selling some of the prettiest
styles which can not be duplicated.
Some new hats have arrived including some of Fisk's models.
We can show you the very proper shoe for your costume, in
gray, brown, tan or black.
