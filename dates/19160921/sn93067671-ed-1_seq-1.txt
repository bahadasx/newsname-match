This section was visited by a fine rain
Septeinber 14. It was badly needed or
sweet potatoes and turnips and of e6tirse
it waf good for other crops as well,
Fodder pulling is the order of thq.day
here, but will be over in a few da,
as the crop was very short at best.
W. L. Green of this place killed g, rat
tlesnake a few days ago tlat Steasured
4 1-2 feet long and had thirteen rattles.
Mr. and Mrs. Grover Moody of this
section left about two weeks ago for
Dayton, Va., where Mr. Moody will at-.
tend a normal singihg institute. We
are sorry to have them leave us. Grov
er is a good organizer and singer. We
extend good luck to ttiem while away
and wish them a safe return.

10-nine young men and one young lady.
Thirteen were addea to the church dur
ing the recent series of meetings. Bro
ther Foster has been pastor at this
church about nine years and has done a
great work.
It is rumored that John T. Woodside
of Greenville is contemplating building
a hike and a big hotel on the land he
owns in this section. There is no douht
19ut that this would be a good invest
ment for Mr. Woodside as he now owns
the highest point for a hotel and the
deepest hollow for a' lake. You can
view Greenville very plainly from the
mountain where the hotel would be
built and down in the valley below is
where the lake would be built. We hope
'the report Is true and would like to talk
to Mr. Woodside about it
Mr. Editor, the writer heard a man
say the other day that a certain candi
date was one of the rottenest men in
the state. We believe the man Is not
as rotten as politics and politics is not
as rotten as some men who vote. A
man cannot vote for his choice without
someone commenting about who he vot
ed for, nor can he go to the polls with
out some rascal trying to change his
mind and get him to vote for some
other fellow's choice, and unless he can
read the poor fellow cannot tell who he
voted for. Will someone please tell the
writer whether this is honest or fraud?
Gentlemen, I say it Is dishonest, and
who can dispute the facts?

A Dangerous Preednt
Mr. Editor: I would like to comment
some 'on the last primary,if 'you will
dl permit me to. do so. I first want to
w quote to your readers a portion of Rule
re 11.
ig "Each applicant for enrollmenit eball
je in person write upon the club roll hii
>y full name and immediately thereafter
id his age, occupation and postoffice ad.
ra dress, and if in a city or town shall
id write the name of the street and the
d I number of the house in which he ke
Ly sides if such designations exist in said
Bk- city or town. If the name' be illegible
to the sepretary shall write the name be
neati the signature of the applicant.
In the event of the inability of the ap
le plicant to write he may make his mark
Id on the roll, which shall be witnessed by
as the secretary or other person then hav
:y ing the custody thereof and the secre
ly tary shall fill in the other requirements.
le I ask this question: Why go to all
is this trouble of having these books of
At enrollment and make all these require
3f ments of the individual voter and at the
w same time have another law to Iupset
n, the whole thing? That is what I saw
to take place 'the 12th of this month at
ie Easley, S. C. Men who had not en
ls rolled on the club roll according to the
't rules of the democratic club were no
3d 'tified to be there and were given ordere
d. from a circuit judge which gave them
Bd the right to vote. I am informed that
n- there were seventeen who did not en
so roll on the club book who voted at Eas
to i ley. These men, I am informed, were
anti-Blease. Now you can see why R.
id: . Manning was nominated or was lead
to ing Blease.by 4,000 votes. '
ig It is claimed there are 1600, boxes in
e, tile state. Well, say three, or an aver
ad age of three, voted at each box. ThAt
d gives over 4,000 votes for Manning. I
- am confident this trick was secretly
t. planned and carried out. How easy it
er was for anyone to get a batch of orders,
d, get a judge to sign them, get out or
ro the streets and highways and tell these
rd men who hadn't enrolled to be on the
rd spot the 12th and he would see to il
ed that they could vote, the card still ul
he his sleeve. When the time came hf
an could take out his order, signed by i
Ld. judge, write their names thereon, takt
ut them to the voting box and vote them.
as Nice trick, isn't it?
i't I am no prophet, but suppose Blease
le and his advisers learn these tricks
It from the anti-Bleasites (knowing also
"n ;the different men under indictment all
over the state for buying votes) con
ie lude to get an order from some judge
to ignore the primary and the demo.
a cratic rules. What then?
a It would be launched through the
id press that Blease has bolted the pri
t mary and appealed to the negro, for
t votes. Would you blame the negro for
voting for him? Blease will have a
better chance at the negro vote than
PAlex Haskell did. That is what the
g anti-Tilmanites did. It would be treason
to do it now. Hence the heading of
this communiation-A dangerous pre
These same anti-Tillmanites, anti-re
rformers, anti-Bleasites set that prece
adent. Was it right then, Brother Anti;
would it be right now? That is the
great question at the present time.
If you will permit me, Mr. Editor, I
will write later on Ben Tillman, Mc
Laurin, W. J. Talbert, Cole Blease and
others. JOEL H. MILLER.

B3Y SPECIAL REQ
)rug Store, Monday,
~ral, S. C., at Central
ember 29; Picken
yes and Fitting Eyeglas:
"B." Ruminates Some
Sunday, the 17th inst., about 10.30 a.
m., the grinder of the old matrimonial
mill near Cateechee was basking in the
sunlight and his toes had got cold and
he had no wood to make a fire, watch
ing the autos as they ran up and- down
the road, which put our thinking appa
ratus to revolving and brought many
past events to our 'mind, to-wit:
Something like forty years ago the
writer remembers his father and his
mother carrying him to Six Mile church,
a distance of fifteen miles, in a "fiat and
skull" wagon and it drawn by two old
flop-eared mules. When we got there
we found a log building with an old-time
boxed-up pulpit, which looked very
much like a horse stall. Directly the
congregation began to gather, the most
of whom came in ox-carts and- the
women with split bonnets on and the
men with brogan shoes.
But when the hour arrived for preach
ing Rev. Jacob Chapman, who we feel
is now interceding on the right hand of
God, preached a sermon that went
straight to the heart and made one's
hair rise on his or her head, The old
women would shout till their bonnets
fell off; and sometimes the old family
dog which had came along would run in
to take part in the disturbance.
But now we can't go to church unless
we can go in a Ford, a Maxwell or some
other kind of a stylish way. Of course
our dressing has got to be up to date,
the pews we sit in have got to be paint
ed and the preacher must be a cultured
speaker. If everything is not exactly
as we think it ought to be we will go
home and make game. Half of us can't
tell what the preacher's text was when
we leave the church.
Well, these were only a few thoughts
that rolled through 'bur mind as the
autos ran up and down the road, when
one rolled up in our yard contain
ing five passengers, two of whom were
the handsomest and pleasingest looking
little couple we ever met. They just
naturally had the appearance of little
angels. They looked so innocent until
the officiating officer thought they ought
to be standing in some pool waiting for
the ordinance of baptism instead of
having a marriage ceremony performed.
However, feeling that they loved each
other and being armed with the proper
authority, J. Alonzo Brown, N. P., de
cided that Mr. Edgar Nelson and Miss
Nellie Sheppard of Liberty shall here
after be man and wife.
Many congratulations to this happy
little couple. B.
