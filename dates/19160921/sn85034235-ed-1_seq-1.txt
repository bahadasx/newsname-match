CHAPTER XV.
Gathering Clouds.
'M innocent, Uncle Abner,"
1 1 Howard declared. "I know
i I nothing nt all about It."
—mmJ "Thank God! An' I believe
you." Abner rose, his face beaming
with jo.v, and began to walk excitedly
back and forth across the floor.
"So that explains it!" Howard ex
claimed. "They all believe it and
shrink fro» me as If 1 were a loath
some cutthroat tramp."
Abner returned to his chair. "Now.
tell me everything." he said gravely.
At this juncture Pole Baker came
into the office, a riding switch in his
hand, a grim look on his face.
"He didn't do it. Pole!" Abner cried
gladly. "They must look some'r's else
fer the man. He ain't here, by
hunky!"
"Thank the Lord!" Pole cried as he
looked at Howard and seemed con
vinced at once. "Somebody else did
it. Craig's got enough enemies. But
it ain't no soft snap we are in." he
added. "It is awful serious. Circurn
stantial evidence has hung many a in
nocent man."
In a low, calm voice Howard went
over all that had happened to him after
leaving Mary till the present moment
He even mentioned the dream in which
he seemed to hear angry voices and
the report of a gun. When he finish
ed Pole lashed his leg with his switch
impatiently.
"Is that all the alibi you kin estab
lish?" he growled. "I believe you, an
Uncle Ab does, because we know you
won't lie to us. You couldn't fool us
anyway with that clear eye in yore
head; but, boys, facts is facts, an' dan
ger is danger. A jury of plain men
ain't goin' to swallow a tale aboqt
sleepin' on a hilltop an' dreamin' that
some other man fired the shot. It Is
serious, dem serious, an' we'd as well
admit it as a starter. The feller that
did the job ain't goin" to come for
ward and stick his neck in the noose;
lie'll let the accused man take the med
icine if he's allowed to; yon bet be
will!"
An hour laten Pole, who had gone
out. returned to the office.
"What's wrong?" Abner asked, as he
and Howard looked up.
"Enough, the devil knows." Pole re
turned with a sigh. "The coroner's
jury has set on the case. Tom Sugart
tvas called on to testify, an' old man
mgguis mat repaired Howard's gun.
Four or five fellers swore that Howard
threatened to do It, and, worse than
nil, Jake Brown testified that he pass
ed Craig's gate about midnight and
saw Howard that*, waitin' fer him to
git home."
"You didn't say that anybody seed
you stop thar," Abner put iu anxiously.
"A man passed while I was at the
gate," Howard replied. "I didn't know
who it was, and I didn't think he rec
agnized me. Well, well, out with it,
Tole, what was the verdict of the jury?
I'm ready for anything now."
"It went agin us," Pole answered
gloomily. "As they put it thar was
►trong probability that you done it
We may as well face the music like
meu. The grand jury will find a bill
an' an arrest will be made unless evi
dence is found beforehand that some
one else is the right party."
"Arrest—do you think they would ar
rest me?" Howard said, his anger ris
lug
Neither of his two friends replied.
"I see; you think they will," Howard
went on. "And, moreover, it may not

"Do you think they would arrest me?"
Howard said.
even be a bailable case, and I may
have to lie In that dirty jail till the
ran court couvenes, and all liecause a
drunken"—
"Don't; the feller's dead!" Abner said
reprovingly. "You must keep yore
temper. Howard."
That evening when Abner rode up
to the barnyard at Trumbley's he saw
Mary and Mrs. Tinsley at the gate in
front of the house and knew that they
were waiting for him. Leaving the
older woman, Mary came along the
fence and joined him as he was dis
mounting at the bars.
"I tiiought I'd warn you," she whis
pered. "Mrs. Tinsley has not heard
of the verdict of the coroner's jury.
We've kept that from her. but she
knows all the rest. She is fairly des
perate. She seems to think she has
not heard the worst and is almost dis
traeted. She has done nothing but
walk to and fro between her house and
ours. Uncle Abner, I don't believe
Howard did it. I don't, I don't!"
"I know he didn't." Abner answered.
"I am absolutely sure of it."
Through the dusk the old woman ad
vanced til! she stood facing Abner.
She put an unsteady iiand on his sad
dle. "Whar's Howard?" she inquired.
"I left 'ini in the offic» gittiu' ready
to go to his supper," was the prompt
response. "Me 'if him worked hard
today gittin' out the paper. I'm here
to state, an' ef we both don't sleep
sound tonight it will be because the
mosquitoes know the'r business bet
ter'n we do our'n."
Tm no fool, Abner Daniel." the wo
man blurted out, a great stare of de
spair in her eyes. "I know the danger
that's hoverin' over my child better'n
anybody alive. Till today I gloried In
the mercy of the Lord. I was grate
ful for what yon did to keep Howard
here at home whar I could see 'im
now an' then, but this is what even
that brief joy has fetched to me. I
can't stand it—I can't—I can't!"
Abner's voice was full of clashing
currents when he answered, looking
down into the storm swept face.
"Yore boy is innocent of that crime,
Mrs. Tinsley, an' ef God let's 'im suf
fer fer it I'll turn ag'in all that's holy
good in the universe. The situa
tion may he a little sbaky now, but
right will prevail In the eud."
"That's all you kin tell me. then?"
the woman panted. "You say right
will prevail. I don't know. I doubt
everything now. Nothin' is fair to me,
it least. If they dare—dare to put my
boy under lock and key"— But she
was unable to speak further. With a
Iry sob. a high heaving of her breast
r,he turned and walked away.
The next morning Abner was up with
the dawn. Indeed, he had slept little
through the night and was feeling the
111 effects of it. He ssfcr Tele Baker
walking briskly along the road from
the village.
"Whar you been so early?" Abner
asked.
"I stayed in town." Pole answered
"I sat up with Howard in his room
till after midnight."
"I'm glad you kept 'im company,'
Abner said, plaintively.
"I had to stay." Pole said. "It looks
like everyliody in town is actually
afenrd of 'im. an' he's noticed It
Frank Reymond and some other boys
dropped In, but they had little to say,
an' all but Frank looked as if they be
lieved Howard was lyin'. What'i
friendship in time o' real trouble? Not
wuth a hill o' beaus."
Abner leaned on the bars, sliding hi
strong thumlr nail under a splinter,
slowly prying it off and putting it be
tween his tobacco stained and blunted
teeth. "I've been bothered about the
grand jury." he said. "I wonder o
it will act. Ef an actual arrest is
made it will go hal'd with the poor
boy."
"It is sure to come an' early today, 1
Pole replied.
"You think so?" Abner said despon
dcntly.
"Not tiie slightest doubt of it," Pole
went on. "In fact, Howard was
watched close all last night. The front
.«ml back doors of the hotel was guard
ed by the sheriff and his deputy."
"How do you know that?" Abner
asked.
"I seed 'em; so did Howard. We
took a little walk, an' they followed
us. Howard looked pale,, an' I thought
the fresh air would do 'im good. As
I come away this mornin' I met the
sheriff on the back porch. I know 'im
well. I legged fer 'im In his election,
an' he would do me a favor ef It come
his way. He knows how I like How
ard, too, au' 1 stopped an' told 'lm
I was sure Howard wasn't the man,
an' both him an' the deputy seemed
astonished.
" 'What do you take me fer?" the
sheriff axed. 'Didn't I hear Howard
threaten to do it? An' wasn't he on
the spot half an hour before the shot
was fired with a loaded gun in his
pocket?' "
"That's what they ail say," Abner
sighed. "His own father come over last
night about bedtime to see me. I told
'im Howard was innocent, but it went
in at one ear and out at tbe other."
"Well, I must go home an' git my
breakfast." Pole said, "then I'll meet
you in town. Howard tried to git me
to wait an' eat at the hotel, but they
hadn't made the fire in the kitchen
stove when I got up. an - I'm hungry.
Besides, I like honte cookin' an' cof
fee that's just right Thar's another
thing that is odd about me, too. Uncle
Ab, an' that is that I never feel right
cf 1 start a day without secin' my chil
dren. 1 want to see 'em all in a bunch
at the tabic oatin' the'r fill. Another
odd thing about me is that I hate to
come home late at night an' find 'em
all asleep. 1 want 'em to be awake,
ef it is jest fer a minute. It seems
like something awful has happened ef
they don't crawl over my lap an' hug
me an' say good night. I don't know—
I reckon I'm a womanish feller. Rally,
my first wife, used to make 'em say
the'r prayers up to the day she died.
They 'u'd kneel down on tue noor an
say' em out loud, an' I swear it was as
purty a sight as a man would care to
see. But Jane comes of hard tbinkin'
Dutch stock, an' never had any sort
o' religion, an', while she is pure gold
in many ways, she don't seem to be
lieve thar is secli a thing as a God or a
hereafter."
When Baker was trudging away
and Abner was turning toward the
house, Mary came from the kitchen, a
pan of meal dough in her hands with
which she was feeding the ducks aud
chickens.
I don't think I slept a wink last
night," she said, as she emptied the
pan and turned to meet him. "How
ard and I have been such close friends
for so long that a calamity like this is
almost unbearable. You will want to
get to town early. I'm sure, and so
I'm going to get your breakfast."
They went into the quaint old kitch
en. Seeing a nice strip of bacon
table Abner cut several slices,
and, holding them over the embers on
,i fork, lip broiled them.
"Let me fry you some fresh eggs,"
she suggested. "The pan is hot. and
it won't take n minute."
"Thank you," he said. "You are a
ood gal, Mary—as good as I ever
knowed."
"I ouly wish I were," she faltered
"Then maybe God would hear my pray
ers. Uncle Abner"— She hesitated.
'1 know what it was," he said
"You needu't tell me. fer I know. At
seeh a time, little girl, you an' me
could only pray fer one thing."
But I've been wondering"—Mary
fixed her eyes on his melting face as
she moved a small table forward for
Ins plate and cup and saucer—"I've
been wondering if there is not some
great spiritual law at the bottom of
wbat Jesus kept emphasizing—that
only prayers made in perfect faith are
answered. And ns I kept praying last
night I began to wonder if my prayers
were not actually hindered by my doubt
and fears."
"I catch yore point.'' Abner had fix
ed his eyes on her grief swept face
"That's one of the biggest thoughts in
the world. I have tuck notice that
when I pray fer a thing an' know It
is cornin' that it always does come, an
ef I doubt at all the whole thing falls
flat."
"Thafs it"—Mary suppressed a sigh
—"and all last night, while 1 was pray
Ing. something seemed to keep saying
to me that wrong had to be in the
world, and that in consequence my
prayers were falling on closed ears. If
I could have believed they would be
answered perhaps they would have
been, but my fears were so overpower
Ing that"— **
"Ah. that's a fact, an' a big. big one!"
Abner broke in. with kindling eyes.
"Who knows but that was yore su
preme tost? I think sech trials have
to come to all of us accordin' to divine
law. Tharin lies the meaning of 'Thy
will he done.' It seems awful unfair
to have to bow tbe head before injus
tice. as we look at it. but ef you or I
could rise so high right now as to be
able to submit without a murmur even
to the worst that might happen in this
case we might be nigher to tbe nature
o' God. Another Mary long ago had
to stand by an' see her beloved son
slowly tortured to death, but look what
has come of it—come of it to the whole
wide world? Can we doubt that that
mother, livin' now amongst the bless
ed, is satisfied with all that happened?
Why, every soul, Mary, that wings its
way heavenward through that influ
ence would fall faintin' with bliss at
er feet God's law is right an' it is
more sure to be right at the very time
we think it is wrong. I'm shrinkin'
back from this here trouble, but even
ef it went plumb agin me I'd still try
to think God knowed better what was
right than me. Did I ever tell you
about how my best comrade in war
times died?"
an'

"1 don't think so," Mary answered.
"Me an' him was nigh the same
age," Daniel went on reminiscently,
"an' hardships an' trouble in them
awful times tied us closer together.
We marched side by side, shared our
ratious o' hardtack an' salt pork an
drank water from the same canteen
after his was shot off his back in a
skirmish. He was the best, purest
minded boy I ever knowed. His beard
was jest beginning to sprout like yal
ler fuzz on a peach; his eyes was sky
blue, an' his hair was reddish gold.
He smiled like a gal. He was an only
son of a poor widow, an' she had doted
on 'im so much that she wouldn't con
sent to his goin' to war. But he got

Knowin' that boy convinced me that
thar are some persons that are sensi
tive enough by nature to know when
a thing bas happened off at a distance
and even be aware lieforeliand that
something important is aliout to lake
place. That boy predicted so many
things accurately that the soldiers
would come to 'im at night an' ax im
ef all was well nt the'r homes an' ef
they was goin' to git letters, an' the
like. Sometimes he'd make a fry at it.
an' then agin he'd say he wasn't in
trim for It. He used to tell me things
that he kept back from the others. For
instance. I've seed 'im suddenly point
out a comrade as we was marc bin' to
battle an' heard im sigh an' say that
he felt sure that particular one would
fall before night, an' it come true

encouragin' us with Jokes an' pranks
an' jolly sougs. He looked downcast
an' had a far off stare in Ids eyes. 1
got uneasy, fer 1 'lowed maybe the
poor food an' lack o' substantial shoes
an' clean clothes had made im sick
[ tried to cheer 'im up, Dut lie wouldn't
smile. Purty soon, when the bugle
was callin' us to the front to meet the
long blue Hue that we seed across the
I
hills in the'r splendid clean uniforms
an' glitterin' guns an' bayonets, he
reached out an' ketched my hand.
'Shake, Ah, old boy,' said he, an he
clung to my hand tight, an' I felt it
quiverin'.
" 'What's wrong?' said 1.
"Then, lookin' me straight in the
face, he said, with a husky quiver in
his voice: Tm goin' to git shot in this
battle. Ab. I know it.'
"I tried to treat It light, i slapped
im On the back an' told 'im to pluck
up, but he stared at me like a person
in a dream. He refused to load his
gun—said he didn't intend to take bu
man life on the eve of losin' his own
Why,' said he as ef he'd never thought
of it before, 'I haiu't a thing ag'in any
o' them men out thar. They are drove
jest as we are drove by politics an
head men that are well fed an' safely
housed in Washington.'
"Two or three others was listenin',
an' they had the saddest faces 1 ever
seed on human frames, fer they loved
im. They 'u'd 'a' cried ef they hadn't
been ashamed, especially the fellers
that had left wives an' little children
at home an' had a feajr o' death. Right
then durin' all that hurry an' turmoil
he wanted to talk about a future life,
an', above all. he was troubled about
leavin' his mother.
" 'It is yore duty to load an' shoot
said a man who was sorter bitter ag'in
the Yanks an' hadn't as much heart as
the rest of us.
"'1 won't do it' the boy answered.
'The spirits of the mothers of some o'
them men are hoverin' over 'em tryiu
to protect 'em from harm, an' I'm goin
to join 'em soon. You kin shoot, but 1
won't. My commandin' officer ain't
out thar on a boss in a cocked hat an
spurted boots. He Is on high, an' he
ain't well pleased with this sight, fer
iiis children wear both blue an' gray,
an' in this beautiful valley of his créa
tion they are goin' to tear one another
like ravenin' wolves.'
"When the battle begun, somehow
I'd lost my old fightin' spirit. 1 didn't
take careful aim. an' I sort o' hoped
the Lord would guide tbe balls that
whizzed from my gun an' not hold me
accountable, fer I was wrought up
more'n 1 ever had been. He fell as
he said he would. I run to his side.
" 'Goodby.' he said, with t gurgle.
'That ball went clean through me.
Fer a minute I beut over 'im. too full
o' grief to say a word; then he plucked
up his strength, an' as he clung feebly
to my hand he said: 'Tell my mother
mat I died all right. Ab. an' that I
ask her forgiveness. 1 know 1 shall
meet her again.'
"1 left 'im dead on the ground,
sprawled out like many other boys."
"Aud yntr catne in time to think eton
that was right?" Mary sighed "For
I've heard you say all things are right."
"Yes, even that poor boy's deatb was
right." Abner answered. "Divine or
der is made to appear twisted to us
chat we may rise in the effort to
straighten it out. I'm goin' to flght
fer Howard, Mary, with all my might
and main. God may show me a way
to help 'im. an' ef lie does I'll be ready
to tale advantage of the chance."
CHAPTER XXVI.
the morning of the day Fred
Craig had fought with How
ard at the postoffice he had
left his bed in the worst of
surly tempere. He had been drinking
heavily the night before, and, to add
to tbls, the negro woman who usually
prepared his meals had sent a little
girl to say that she was sick aud
could not come. He attempted to cook
something for himself, but, owing to
unsteady hands and general lack of
skill, lie failed almost totally. He cut
his fingers and scalded bis hands with
the water he was boiling for coffee.
Drinking copiously from a jug of
moonshine whisky, his temper grew
worse. Carrying a loaded revolver in
his hip pocket and scarcely knowing
what he was doing he shot at a faith
ful dog because it ran barking across
the yard and barely missed the ani
mal. He was going to town, but re
membered that he was to look at
some work being done by Abe Fulton,
a rough, unlettered laborer with whom
he had often had disputes, in the field
back of the house. The work was t he
construction of a modern barbed wire
fence to take the place of a decayed
rail one through which stray hogs re
cently had been breaking. Craig walk
ed unsteadily across the old furrows
of the Held to the spot where Fulton
was at work. Intoricated as he was.
he yet bad sense enough to see that
the man had made a groat mistake by
the irregularity with which the wire
had been nailed upon the hard oak
and hickory posts. The mistake meant
the taking down and replacing of
more than a hundred yards of the
fence, aud Craig was beside himself
with rage.
"1 told you plainly that the wires
were to stand six inches apart." he
railed out at Fulton, with an abusive
oath "Here they are ten, there fully
twelve. What do you mean? I've a
good mind to kick you out of this
field! You want money by tonight do
you? You won't get a cent out o' me. j
Set to work and do this all over." j
The laborer laid down bis tools, a
dogged look of resentment hardening
his face. "You was drunk when you
told me to do it." he growled. "Yon
don't know what you said—you never
do One minute you say a thing an'
the next take it back. You say I won't
be paid fer tliis. 1 say I will. Me 'n'
my wife need the money for grub, an'
I'm goin' to have it!"
"YouTi have what I give you when
I give it to you. not a bit sooner,"
Craig blustered.
"1 say I will have it." The glare in
the eyes of the workman was that of
a demon, and, stepping forward, he
thrust his hand into his fiocket, as if
to get a knife.

is not the only new feat
ure about the Maxwell
car. Improvements have
been made in the way of
longer rear springs, more
room in both front and
rear seats, and gasoline
gauge and dash light
have been added.
Mind You
—the Maxwell (a regular
stock car) holds the
world's non-stop record—
22,022.3 miles.
—it made 562.5 miles the
last 24 hours of that run
of 44 days and nights.
—averaged nearly 23 miles
to the gallon of gasoline
during the entire run.
And—that it was the Max
well that made the spectac
ular leap of 47 feet over a
chasm without a break or
displacement of any kind.
Tbe Maxwell is not only the best
built car of its size, but is the
most economical—and the most

"Take your hand out of that pocket!"
Craig yelled, drawing bik revolver and
presenting it unsteadily. "Take it out
or I'll blow your head off!"
Abe obeyed, a dull look of animal
fear capturing his flushed features.
"Ah-ha! x«Ai tiiought you would tac

Craig growled. "Now set to work and

ward his barn to get his horse. Abo
was staring after him. standing as still
as one of the [Mists lie had put into the
ground.
Riding home that night after his hu
miliating encounter with Howard, his
bloated face smarting from the blows
tbe younger man had dealt, his brain
inflamed with whisky, ids mind full
of plans for revenge, he gave no
thought to the man with whom lie had
quarreled earlier in the day. At a mo
ment like that a low hireling that de
fended u|K>n him for a living was not
to be thought of. Howard was proml
uent; Howard was educated: Howard
was a man who bore the reputation of
lieing afraid of no one and never tak
ing an insult. The public would wait
for the outcome. Tomorrow. Craig
