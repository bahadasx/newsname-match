SUIT FILED TO DISPLACE ,
ROAD COMMISSION
Suit wo s filed at Stanton late
yesterday afternoon, Sept. 20tli,
iu the Powell Circuit Court by
Beven citizens and taxpayers to
displace- the Powell Comity Road
Commission jiamed by Judge
Knox and confirmed by other
meinbers of the Fiscal Court at a
session May 27th. Tho petition
tiled makes the Fiscal Court co
defendants, but it is afiserted
that the Fiscal Court, which 'has
also grown tired of the Commis
sion, will not defend the action.
The petition alleges that the Com
mission was wrongfully and un
lawfully appointed and that their
attempting - to sell the bonds' is
also wrongful and unlawful.
A temporary restraining order
was gotten out before the Clerk
which enjoins the Commission
from selliug the bonds as adver
tised or from doing anything
toward constructing or recon
structing roads iu tho county.
This brings the road situation
in this county to a standstill for
at least the present. If the pe
titioners gain the suit the irlagis.
trates of the county will build
the roads instead of the Commis-

Local Paper $2 per Year.
Owing to tho unreasonable in
crease in urice of print paper and
every other article that goes into
the mukop of a uewspaper, which
hits hit the Irvine Sun as every
other newspaper in this country,
it-will charge $2 per year for the
Suu after Nov. 1st instead of the
old price of $1. There is until
ing else to it, if print paper
makes advances in the uext few
months as iu the past, every local
paper now existing will of neces
sity be getting more money for
their paper or have their doors of
business closed.
Of Benefit to Widowed Pensioners.

Congress all widowed pensioners
of Civil Wur voteraiiB past seven
ty yours will receive a pension of
820.00 per mouth in the future,
and all widows will got pensions
though married to veterans after
1800. A former law prohibited
uuy widow who married an old
soldier after lbOO from drawing a

Working the Road.
Quito a number of persons in
terested in the improvement of
the Estill county road met at. the
bridge across the river two miles
south of town Friday and began
working to put tins hill on grade.
Working was spirited, nnd there
were all the teams that could be
brought into use. Work has pro
gressed on this hill each day since
then. Not a very large force,
bur. enough to keep things mov
ing until the busy season of sor
ghum making and peavine cut
ting js passed am' more can come
to the rescue.
In other portious of the county
we leurn that tho same process is
going ou. The people of Powell
county waut roads and they are
going to have them at any cost.
After Fiscal Courts.
The attention of the Fiscal
Courts of Clark and Powell coun
ties will be called to the unsafe
and almpst impassable couditiou
of the approach of the inter

If Rowan is like Powell we list
the dogs all right, but get raised

To Keep Sorghum from Granulating
Wo read from our favorite farm
paper that to keep sorghum from
granulating all that is necessary
is to cut tho cane aud let it lay
iu piles for a week aud the mo
lassos will remain waxy the whole
year through. The fact that so
much sorghum is being made in
Powell and the remedy is so sim
pie, nnd that no one likes grainy
molasses, it is well that tho
change in making bo tried.

new Waltersvillo school houso
Tuesday night, A large crowd

time was spent, the proceeds net
ting $10.50. Several from town
