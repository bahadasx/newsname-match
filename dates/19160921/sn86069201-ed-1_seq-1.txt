there are three ripenings and it is better

this year is unusually good and will
bring a good price

THE MAINE RESULT
PLEASES WALL STREET.
Following the Maine election Wall
Street marked up prices of stocks in
the glad hope of the election of Mr.
Hughes whose triumph would be a vic
tory for reaction, the trusts, high
taritfs and all the great financial in
terests had formerly controlled the Re
publicans administration. There is no
doubt that Mr. Hughes is Wall Streets
candidate and that alone ought to make
honest people rally to the support of
Wilson.

CHURCH BEGINS SONDAY
So much interest is being manifested
in the revival that is to begin at the
Christian church next Sunday mornirg,
tliat it bids to be one of the most suc
cessful meetings ever held in our city.
Dr. C. S, Ilrooks, the evangelist who
; will conduct the services, comes highly
l reccomended as a speaker ot unusual
force and eloquenca and we feel will be
heard with much interest und profit.
J Appropriate music has been arranged
, for the entire series, the choir having
' practiced for several weeks for this
eventful occasion.
THE UNION DOES NOT
FOLLOW MAINE ALWAYS.
The silly and untrue belief that "as
goes Maine so goes the Union", nas
caused thoughtless people to feel con-
jcern. The fact is Maine has gone Ite
puulican ever since the war. except
that Mr. Wilson secured a small plural
ity, when Taft and Roosevelt divided
the r.ormal Republican vote, whereas
the country has eleet-sd a Democratic
president three times during the period.
It went Republican both times that
Cleveland was elected, thus showing
mat laisity of the superstition. Never
in the history of the State have the
Republicans carried it by so small
majority as last week and if the sign
is worth shucks the advantage is alto
gether with the Democrats. More than
thirty-three per cent of the Progress
ives refused to return to the g. o. n.
and if this ratio is maintained all over
the country, I'resident Wilson is sur
to be elected by an overwhelming ma
jority. Resides the Democrats gained
this year 15,434 votes over 1912, while
the Republicans gained only 5,31!), or
nearly three times as many. The New
York Herald, a strong Hughes sup
porter says neither party has anything
to brag about in the Maine election,
and If Maine is a barometer the Nat
ional election Is still on the "knees of
the Gods", with no absolute certainty
that It will go to the Hughes' column.
The nope for Hughes land-slide failed
to materialize and the result is worse
than a dog fall for the Republicans and
will make the Democrats redouble their
energies for the man who his done so
much for the country.
CHRISTIAN CHURCH TO
MEET AT WINCHESTER.
The annual State convention of the
Christian Church in Kentucky will be
held here beginning Monday and con
tinuing thru Thursday. R, II. Cross

land of Carlisle.

cuted for the convention, and a large

CONDITIONS PROVE REVERSE
Refutation of Candidate Hughes'
theory that we are living in a "fool's
paradise", appears on every hand, but
with no greater force than in this
statement of the comptroller of the
currency that twenty-four national
banks have been organized since July
1st, with a capital of $1,845,000 while
other national banks have increased
the-ir capital $1,615,000, making an in
creased banking capital in two months
of $3,400,000. The country was never
more prosperous or had a better future,
made possible by needed financial laws,
farm credits and other valuable con
structive legislation passed during the
Wilson administration. If there is any
thing in the axiom, "let well enough
alone", this is the time to exercise it
and reelect Woodrow Wilson for four
more yearn ot patriotic service.
