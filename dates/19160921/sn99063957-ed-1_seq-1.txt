shal Mackenson has shitted ti is attack
and js attempting to carry the war in
to King Ferdinand's country by a
etroke 'from the northwest.
The German war office this after
noon announced that the Austro-Gor-mnns
have won victories on both sides
of the Vulcan mountain pass, one of the
gateway on the Rumanian northwest
ern frontier, offer ririviim fl,n p,,ml..
inns back 10 miles. The Kumnnian war
ornce admitted a retreat in this region
lmt declared the Rumanians have halt
ed and are defending themselves behind
a new fortified line.
The Bulgarian war office today ad
mitted the defeat of German and Bul
garian attempts to penetrate the new
Itiisso-Bumaninn front in the Dobrudja.
The Rumauian war office not only re
ported the repulse of all Tentonic at
tacks but declared that the Russians
and Rumanians are now attackiug on
the whole front.
( In Macedonia fierce Bulgarian coun-
.. ter attacks have held up temporarily
the progress of the allied left wing-except
at the extreme northwestern cor
ner of Greece, where the French report
ed a three mile advanc.
Som progress was made by the Brl
tish on the Somme front last night, but
bad weather hindered operations on
both sides. The principal fighting on
the western front occurred northeast of
Verdun, where the French carried Ger
man trenches and advanced 100 vnrds
at one point.
Heavy fighting continued yesterday
along the Russian fron,t but there was
no change in the general situation ex
cept, in the Carpathians where the Slavs
captured a German position.
t Fight Day and Night.
London, Sept. 21. Jackals and hyen
as, creeping down from the mountains
abng the Scrbo-Greek frontier, are
feasting on the bodies of Bulgarian and
Serbian soldiers slain in fierce fight
ing northeast of Lake Ostrovo. Three
hundred Bulgarian corpses piled in a
heap in one ravine, were stripped of
their flesh by jackals and hvenns at
night and by thousands of crows and
vultures that hovered over the fighting
ground in the day time. Tho dead Bul
garians find been mowed down iu a ma

Serbian nnd Bulgarian lines. When the
Serbs advanced they found only skele
tons and bits of torn uniforms.

TWENTY MILES OF
EM
Army On Border Reviewed
Today, Seven Hours
Passing Stand
By Webb Miller
(United Press staff correspondent)
Kl l'aso, Texas, Sept. 21. In. a col
umn twenty miles in length, national
guardsmen and regular soldiers march
ed through the city and passed the re
viewing hta'nd at Fort Bliss for seven
hours today in Hie biggest infantry di
vision review ever held iu this coun
try. More than twenty six thousand
men, marching four abreast, comprised

In the reviewing stand were Major
General Charles M. Clement, General
George Bell, Jr., and their staffs.
From early morning until afternoon
the Hups swung steadily through the
streets- of Kl l'aso and six miles be
yond the city to the reviewing stands
at Fort Bliss, to the music of thirteen
bands. For hours a solid line of the fa
mous four-point-seven artillery lumber
ed through the crowds. Then followed
engineers, sanitary trains and signal

There wns a thousand wagons and mo
tor trucks and 8,000 horses and mules

SCHOOL HD SHAPE
Superintendent Says Some
time School May Be Moved
to Tacoma
Harivood Hull, superintendent of the
.Salem Indinu school at Chemawa, rather
surprised some of the members of the
Commercial club lust evening when he
.nid in his address thnt it was one of
the probabilities thnt in time the gov
ernment might consider the removal of
the Chemawa school to Tacotnn.
it li no iutention of alarming any
one, Mr. Hall, who has been in the In
dian service for the past 25 years and
who ranks os one of the big men in
Indian work, said that of the six most
important Indian schools in the country,
Chemawa was in general in the worst
condition.
The buildings, he said, were not well
built and there was no student pride
and that in all other lines the Chema
wa school was not abreast with the
other five schools. While other In
dian schools secured ample appropria
tions, nothing bad been done tor Che
mawa and that even the usual appropri
ations asked for in a general nay were
usually cut down. While Chemawa was
falling behind, the Tacoma Indian
school was prospering. "If the Che-
i ' . . 1 1 i i
mBvt-t -M-uuui is nut iinuiiy aoonsneu
by the government," said Mr. Hall, "it
must be kept up with the other five
schools. ' '
Just as a means of preventing this,
Mr. Hall suggested thnt the city, of Sa
lem through its Commercial club take
an interest in the school and get behind
its representatives in congress and se
cure larger appropriations.
liarwoou Hull is one of the experi
enced men in the Indian service and to
him is given the credit not only of the
building of the Sherman Indian school
at Riverside, Cal., but to the maintain
ing the school in the front ranks. The
general opinion wns expressed that the
government had sent the right man to
bring the Chemawa school up to stand
ard. "It's a good idea to bottle up your
wrntn."
"A corking good idea."

.Boston's Chance for Pennant
Boosted While Detroit's
Vanishes
Ravin Field, Detroit, Mich., Sept. 81.
The Tiger curled up and played dead
far Boston today. The world cham
pU'Us walked all over the pennant hopes
of the Detrgit folks by walloping the
jungulers 10 to 2.
The Tigers were never dangerous. In
only one inning, the fourth, were they
able to cope with "Babe" Ruth's
shoots. Then they bunched four hits
off the Red Sox southpaw and con
verted them into their only two tal
lies. Jennings started his tar left hander,
Covaleskie, against the champions, but
he lasted less than three innings. Cov
ey was iu trouble right from the start,
when Walker poled a homer over Cobb 's
head in the first inning, scoring. one of
the Red hose warriors ahead of him.
Boland and Cunningham were seat in
by Jennings later in a vain effort to
stop the avalanche of Boston hits, but
they had indifferent success.
Every one of Cnrrigan's men with
the exception of Gainer, who played on
ly three innings, hit safely off the Tig-,
or hurlers.
Navin Field, Detroit, Mich., Sept. il.
Two of the most effective southpaws
in the American league were pitted
against each other this afternoon in the
final encounter of the year between the
Red Sox and Tigers. Harry . Coval-:
eski was picked by Jennings to stem
the tide of Tiger defeats. "Babe" Duth
worked for Boston.
After a morning of overcast skies
nnd fitful showers, the skies cleared
this afternoon and a warm sun brought
a crowd of 15,000 to the park.
To get a little more batting strength
into the game against the Tiger left
linuder, Manager Carrigan sent Gainer
to first base in place of Hobhtzell,
and played Walker iu center in place
of Shorten.

Sheriff's Wife Fled With Jail
Keys
s but Mob Wrecked
the Doors
Olntho, Knns.,Sept. 21 Storming the
jail, 50 armed men early today lynched
Bert Dudley, avenging the brutal mur
der of Mr. and Mrs. Heury Muller,for
which he was convicted Tuesday.
The mob aroused Sheriff Carroll abiut
midnight and demanded that Dudley be
released to them. He refused.
"Better , let us have him," said the
leader. "We are prepared to- take
him." -
The men cut loose with a volley of
shots, and the o'ff icer yielded. But Mrs.
Carroll had fled in the meantime with
the jail keys.
Determined to get their man, the mob
battered in two jail doors' and when
the fire department attacked the
crowd with streams of water, they
forced the firemen to retreat at gun
points.
Seizing Dudley, the mob hurried him
to waiting moW cars, threw n rope
around bis neck;, sped a quarter of a
mile to the Frisco depot and hanged
him to a telephone pole.
Dudley, an ex-convict, and white, wns
convicted of first degree murder which
carried with it a senteuce of life impris
onment. Kansas does not inflict capi
tal punishment. The mob evidently
thought Dudley deserved death and
administered it.

Frank Crocker, One of Gang
Who Has Confessed,
Slated to Die
ONE OTHER MEMBER
PARTIALLY CONFESSES
Scores of Victims From All
Parts of the Country Write
the Police
Washington, Sept. 21. Disclosures
of n plot kidnap or murder a witness
named Frank Croker, who has made a
full coufessiou regarding the workings
of the nation-wide blackmailers syndi
cate was mado today by a member of
the department of justice investigation
bureau, following a two day session at
tended by division heads from yew-
York, Chicago and Philadelphia.
The plot wkus discovered iu time for
federal officers to transfer Crocker to
another. city. Crocker's testimony,- ac
cording to officials, is esseutial to suc
cessful prosecution of the cases. He is
the only known member of the black
mailers gang who has told all he knows.
Iu this connection it developed this aft
ernoon that one other man under arrest
has. shown signs of weakening, having
told facts regarding operations' of the
gang, with corroborate nil Crocker has
told.
A. Bruce Beilaski. chief of the de
partment's Investigation bureau, cou-
veued the sessions this afternoon after
the rase against the men and women im
plicated. In the Kllpper kidnaping had
been completed. Later this afternoon
all the evidence wns put up to Assist
ant Attorney General WalUice, who will
draw up the prosecution's plan with the
help of Assistant District Attorney
Knox of New. York. The latter will
have charge of the case in court.
Another development of this after
noon wns identification by Division
Chief Offley (if New York, of the man
arrested in Chicago as "Doc" Dona
hue, who has been the object of a
search in New York stale.
Chief Bielaskl this ufternoon told of
the two most popular methods employ
ed by. the blackmailers. The first
was for one of the women members of
the gang to meet the intended victim,
guiu his complete confidence and "lis
ten to any proposition he might make."
The woman would keep her pals inform
ed and at the proper time they would
break in on the victim nnd the woman,
poses as federal agents and arrest
both agents and arrest both.
In some instances a victim has been
held prisoner for as long as 10 days.
During this time he would be given ev
ery opportunity to realize what embar
rassment would attend any publicity nud
then inevitably, it is said, the victim
would offer payment.
Tte second method wns tho "badger
game." The woman would meet the
victim, lend him on nnd at a set time,
one or more of her puis would appear
on the scene in tho lolo tif husbund,
father or brother.
Since publication of tho Chicago dis-
I closures officials said, they have re
ceived scores or letters irom victims
nil over the country. As far ns possible
every case will be investigated.

ENGLAND DENIES
Says No Funds Destined to
Americans in Germany
Are Confiscated -
London, Sept. 21. German propagan
dists are attempting to stir up bad
feeling between the fnited States and
Great Britain by the circulation of
fnlse charges regarding the British cen
sorship, the British foreign office de
clared in a statement to the . Unifcu
Press todny.
"The German wireless news agency,
indeed, the whole system of Germnn
propaganda, loses no opportunity of
endeavoring to create ill feeling be
tween Great Britain and her friends,
said the foreign office. "When, the
facts cannot' be so distorted als to
serve tho German purpose, no scruples
stand in the way of deliberate mendac
ity. "A recent wireless message stated
that veterans of the American civil
war residing In Germany had failed to
receive their pensions for several
months, alleging that they had been ab
stracted by the British censors.,,.
"The allegation that Brifish censors
confiscated moneys intended for.lsuch
persons is wholly false. It cannot be
stated too emphatically that notwith
standing the contraband proclamation
and efforts made to intercept funds en
route to Germany for war loan or -other
purposes, his majesty's government has
given strict instructions that no remit
tances from the United States to cith
er Germany or Austria shall be with
held when there is reason to suppose
thnt such remittances are intended for
bona fide American citizens in enemy
countries."
WILSON WILL IK

Aabury Park, N. J., Sept. 21. Great
importance is attached by the demo
crats to President Wilson's address
next Monday afternoon liefore tho Na
tional Grain Dealers' association at
Baltimore. What tho president has to
say on that occasion and tho reception
accorded his speech, they believe, will
have a strong influence in two of the
most Important voting strongholds of
the country.
The gruin dealers are in intimate
touch with the farmers. They also arc
among tho foremost shippers of the
country, who, tho railroads say will
"have to pay the freight" as a result
of President Wilson forcing the eight
hour legislation through congress.
Appreciating the importance of tin
address tho president already has be
gun work on It. It is likely to show
what the administration has done and
proposes to do for business and what
it has done for the farmer.
The president is also expected to open
mi at Baltimore for the first time in a
counter attack upon Republican Candi
date Hughes on the eight hour issue.
Since the news has gone fortli that
the president will accept several west

here have been literally swamped again
wila nppenls from cities seeking a place
among the chosen few.
Betoro accepting any of the invita

organizers are prepared to call tomor
row, for the greatest walkout in the
history of the city, a sympathetic atriko
of 500,000 union workers.
President Shouts of the Interborough
announced today that the position of
the company "will not bo altered un- s
der any circumstances." Orga,uizer
Fitzgerald declared that "unless the
car mens grievances are adjusted a
general strike will certainly be called
Friday."
Crowds of strikers and sympathizers
are growing more hard to handle as
tne crisis in the situation draws near.
Five hundred strikers and their : sym
pathizers engaged in a running battle
with the police in Central Park west
last night in tho worst outbreak since
the strike began. A police cantaia
was knocked unconscious and au agerf
woman seriously hurt,..., ,
The police department todav- united
with the district attorney' office and
the magistrates courts in a determined
effort to stamp out rioting. Long term
sentences have been threatened and
more than a score now face terms from
live to twenty years.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, has not
come out flatly in favor of the sym
pathetic strike, for which other leader
are preparing today. He said:
"1 am trying to heln arranee an hon
orable adjustment of this horrible sit
uation. 1 want to bring about au early
settlement and 1 will do all in my pow
er to aid tho carmen."
The citizens committee of seventy
five will confer with may and Oscar
Straus, chairman of tho public servi.-e
commission, at ,l o clock today in a
last effort to bring about a settlement
of some sort. First, they will hear the
side of the car men, presented by Or
ganizer Fitzgcrnld at a conference;
which Gompers will attend.
Tho mayor, the polico department
ami city officials are now working a
lung two definite lines. One to pre
vent rioting, the other to secure post
ponement of tho effort to call out a
general strike.
Meanwhile, in secret conference, the
union leaders nre laying their pluns for
the sympathetic wnlKoui of union work
ers throughout the city. While tho po
nce several days ago wero inclined to"
doubt Fitzgerald's power to call out
these workers, statements from union
heads today tended to show that at
least some of them would Biipport tha
cur men.
Krnest Buhm, secretary of the central
federated union, declared "that a a
lust resort" a general sympathetic,
strike of all trudes and industries will
be called.
The strikers nre said to have eulist-
ed ten thousand women pickets who
will attempt to urge union men unit
women not to ride on the transit line
of tho city.
Service was again normal on the sub
way and elevated lines and more sur
face cars than usual wero running early
today.
Over a score of violent outbreak
early today were reported to police
headquarters and two men arrested
for violence, wero charged with felony
