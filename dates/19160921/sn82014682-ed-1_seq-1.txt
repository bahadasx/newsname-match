Unable to attend the Civic Conven
tion, Mayor Join C Lane sent a com
munication to William McKay, presi
dent of the Hilo Board of Trade,
which was to be read at the opening
session this morning. The communi
cation outlines the mayor's ideas re
garding a number of Important civic
problems. It says, In part:
Mayor Sends Letter ;
There is one "new viewpoint how
ever, to our local problems wnich I
desire to bring to the attention of the
convention. It has long been axiom
atic that 'a prophet has no honor in
-his own country. This is merely an
other way,of stating that by reason
of continuous contact and familiarity
between the officers of government in
any community and local civic agen
cies, it is frequently difficult for such
agencies to obtain even serious con
sideraticn for the wo posed adoption
of new forms of organization or new
. methods. ; --'-'Vy
"Local officials throughout the vari
ous department of local governments
are usually cognizant of many defects
In procedure and frequently have
themselves conceived changes which,
if adopted, would correct such defects.
However, the lack of prestige, lack of
moral support within the government
and lack of popular support outside of
the government usually conspire to
prevent the adoption, if not the pro
posal, of such corrective measures.
Red Tape Interferes w
"A second reason which prevents
local governments from achieving the
desired results Is that the same con-
" tact and familiarity with local condi
tions often causes the officials, and, to
a considerable extent the electorate
