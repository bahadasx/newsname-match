National Pay Up Week
We always say, "money makes
the wheels go 'round," and we
usually think it takes a great
deal of honey, tremendous sums
of it, to make these wheels go,
but when you stop to think about
it, a very small amount does a
great deal of work. Just think
for a moment. A small coin put
into circulation will wipe out
many depts and perchance be
turned in to the man who first
set it -going. This is the idea
back ot National Pay-Up Week.
For example, we will say that
Mr. A, who is a merchant, owes
Mr. B, a garage man, $5.00.' B
in turn owes Mr. C, the butcher,
$5.00. Mr. C, owes Mr. D, a
farmer, $5.00 for a load of feed,
and Mr. D, the farmer, owes Mr.
A $5.00 for groceries. A pays
his bill to B, who passes it on to
C, who in turn gives it to D, and
D returns it to A. Four accounts
are paid with the same $5.00 and
it returns to A for use in pay
ment of his account to the
wholesale house which in turn
pays its help and its places of
supply, and so it goes. Any of
the four men can start the ball
rolling.' The only thing necessary
is for some one of them to pay
his account to date and put the
money in circulation. This, with
an honest desire on the part of
everyone to pay his debts, helps
the entire community. The ob
ject of National Pay-Up Week is
to wipe out all the accounts pos
sible in this community. Every
body is in it and everyone will be
helped. Every time a debt is
paid, a load is lifted. Let s un
ioad during National Pay-Up
Week. Let's start the lazy dol
lar going. Men of every calling
in life all over the United States,
iarmers, doctors, lawyers, mer
chants, bankers, working men,
are attracted by the possibilities
of National Pay-Up Week be
cause it is not a bad debt collec
tion device but a plan which re
sults in the payment of good
debts. Do you know which dol
lar it is that makes, the most
trouble for business? It is the
dollar that is as good as "old
wheat in the mill" but which
does not move on when it is most
heeded. It is the debts people
owe that they could easily pay
but simply neglect to pay that
cause the trouble. It is not the
deadbeat account that worries
you or any other man.
When National Pay-Up Week
publicity gets into action it fo
cuses the attention of careless
folks on the subject of communi
ty payment and gets them to re
alize that those few dollars that
they owe to local people have an
enormous number of idle broth
ers, sisters, uncles, aunt, nieces,
nephews, cousins, and other near
kin which might be doing a lot
of good in business circles but
are loafing around and not doing
the immunity "any good by cir
culating. It is the circulating dollars,
the busy, rolling dollars, that
make the life-blood of local busi
ness. That same rolling dollar
may pass in one day through fif
teen or twenty different hands
and pay off $15 to $20 in small
debts. The problem is just to
get it rolling.
Let's not forget this during
the week of October 2-7, the
time designated by our Mayor as
Pay-Up Week.

Married
The announcement of the mar
riage of Miss Otsie Danks to Dr.
Keorge A. Keeley at National
City, California, on September
6th, has been received by Meade
friends. Miss Danks is a daugh
ter of M. O. Danks, who former
ly resided south of Meade, and
until a few years ago made her
home in this city. She is well and
favorably known to our people,
and is a young lady of most ex
cellent qualities. We are not ac
quainted with the groom, but
nevertheless he is most fortun
ate in winning Miss Danks for
a helpmate.
Dr. Kelley and wife will be at
home in Los Angeles, California,
after October 1st.
The News extends congratula
tions and wishes these people a
happy married life.

More Reads
Several weeks ago The News
made mention ot machinery pur
chased by the county, to be used
in working the roads. We also
made mention of the various
roads the County Commissioners
had laid out to build. Work was
commenced in the third district,
or out of Plains. All roads out
in that vicinity have now been
completed and Mr. Cordes, C6mj
missioner from this district, in
forms us that the machinery has
been moved east and roads out of
Meade are now being Vorked.
The one south to Englewood is
at the present time being grad
ed. Next will be the south road
out of Meade, then those north
and east. When that is finished,
the machinery will be moved
again, and the Fowler roads
graded.
Good roads are very essential
toward the building up of -any
town, and the Commissioners
have, been very fair in their road
policy, so that when all are com
'pleted, Plains, Meade, and Fow
ler will each have good roads
j leading to them from all direo
jtions.
From time to time, as occasion
demands and good judgment
'warrants, more roads will be
'built.
I Stamp Tax Repealed
I Last Saturday was the last day
for the "stamp tax" on most ar
ticles but most of us didn t find
it out for a day or two. This
law providing for a "war tax
was passed to take effect Decem
ber 1, 1914, to take care of de
ificit arising in revenue depart
!ments as a result of the Euro
'. pean war. Now congress' has ar
ranged for additional tax on in
heritances and war munitions
' and repealed the tax on the fol
lowing: telegraph and tele
phone messages, parlor car seats,
and berth tickets, bonds, deben
tures, certificates of indebted
ness, certificates of stock, trans
fer bills of sale, promissory
notes, express and freight mani
fests and bills of lading, bonding
instruments, conveyances, insur
ance policies, entry of goods,
passage tickets, power of attor
ney, protests, perfumery, cos
metics and chewing gum. Hug

Your . Home Town
Estimates based on official
figures, which are backed up by
over-the-state figures of Kansas
investigators, show that the
people of Kansas are sending out
of the state in & retail way the
enormous sum of 20 million dol
lars a year to buy goods which
could be bought in the state, and
which m nearly every instance
could be bought in the purchas
er's own home town. And here
are some state population figures
which will be of interest m this
connection: In 1912 sixty-eight
Kansas counties and 252 Kansas
country towns and villages had
fewer people in them than they
had twelve months before in
1911. The state as a whole lost
seventeen thousand during that
twelve month period, yet the
larger cities ot the state in
creased in population. In 1914
seventy-one Kansas counties and
294 Kansas country towns and
villages had fewer people ' in
them than they had twelve
months before in 1913. The
state as a whole lost thirteen
thousand during that twelve
month period, yet the larger
cities of the state continued to
increase in population. And, the
figures for 1915 showed that in
spite of the fact that the cities
of Kansas had continued to grow
had continued to increase in
population we had in 1915 in
the state of Kansas 34,000 less
people than we had in 1909, sev
en years ago. Out-of-the-state
buying means big business for
the city it means increased
population ; it means increased
prosperity. It means more jobs
it means that more country
boys will be Kansas farm own
ers. Out-of-the-state buying
means a slow market at home
less retail trade fewer local in-
dustries fewer jobs a slump
in 'population decreased prop -
erty values. It means a lack of
community interest, a loss of
community spirit. It means dead
towns in the state of Kansas.
Kansas men and Kansas women
who love their state should urge
tneir menus to suck vy ivansas i
institutions.

Hilliard Wins
At the primary, recently held
in Colorado, Ben HMiard, tor-
merly a resident of Meade coun
ty, and for the past two years
congressman from the Denver
district, again won out for the
nomination on the Democratic
ticket for the place. His oppon
ent was a son of former Senator
Henry M. Teller, who bolted the
St. Louis convention in 1896.
The fight was a hotly contested
one but Hilhard won by a small
margin. Mr. Hilliard visited
Meade about a year ago, and will
be remembered by many of our
people. .
Mr. Peter Eckhoff who lives
south of Meade has a broken bip

it is very doubtful whether she
will regain the use of it. Mrs.
Eckhoff is an oid timer in
Meade county aud her misfor
tune is generally regretted.

steady growth Meade is making.
Golmar Bros. Circus will be in
Meade October 7. This is one of
the five biggest shows of this
kind traveling, and their per
formances will no doubt be far
above the average. Watch for
later advertisements.
