LOOK HERE, MR. DELINQUENT
TAXPAYER
Below is a sample of how they do
things over in Colfax county, saving
the county and the delinquent tax
payer both a lot of useless expense.
The "tax administration" over In Col-
i fax seem to recognize the law and try
! ., . .. . ,
ior an aionK since me tuw whs passeu
in 1915. The list from which the
samplc is taken was published in the
Raton Range, issue of July 21, 1916.
After you have read it over carefully
then get an "official organ" of Union
county and compare them. Then read
the law again which we are publishing
again this week and see if you want
to pay what is going to be demanded
of you. However, we claim that the
sample selected contains more than
the law requires to be published. But
here it is:

1 STATES SENA
Since it is not a
shepherd, for the meelc a.
arene, himself, said, "I am
shepherd," it were better to .
one who is both a statesman ana
good successful shepherd than one
.who is merely a statesman, and it is
now very certain that the people of
New Mexico want one for United
States senator who is something more
than a mere professional lawyer;
they want some on who, besides hav
ing the qualities of a statesman, has
something in common with the masses
of the people; some one who has some
other than a parasitic occupation;
some one whose own personal interests
?nd occupation and busings li) life is
identified with that of the common peo
ple; some one who is able to produce
the means of living rather than some
one who must use the law as a lever
with which to pry such means loose
faom those who do produce them; and
this being the case of the people of
New Mexico, when the roll is called
next March in Washington, Frank A,
Hubbell will answer present in the
senate of the United States the Santa
Fe New Mexican and one or two other
would-be-spectacular sheets to the
contrary notwithstanding.
It will be remembered by those who
happen to know, that the Santa Fe
New Mexican threatened some - ter
rible exposures of what it intimated
as being a very black record of the of
ficial life of Mr. Hubbell over in the
"free state'1 nf Bernalillo county" and
all because Mr. Hubbell happened to
be the nominee of the republican par-
ty for United States senator. It blew ,
