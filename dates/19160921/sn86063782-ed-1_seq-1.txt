McLaurin to Res
His
Letter Addressed to
Arthur Banks Explains
Contemplated
Course.
SUPPORTED BLEASE
AGAINST MANNING;
Says Governor Has Views Other Than
His for Future of Storage
System?Enumerates Some
if His Achievements.
Johu L. McLaurin, in a letter an
dressed to J. Arthur lianas of St. Matthews,
copies of which were distributed
to the press Saturday, says that he
will shortly resign us state warehouse
commissioner. The commissioner, in
seven typed sheets, comments on his
purpose as follows:
"It is my desire to retire as State
warehouse '.'ommissioner, and this is
to advise you that 1 will tender my
resignation to the governor at an eariy
date. My purpose is to give you an
opportunity to take such action as you
may deem wise to secure a capable
man as my successor.
"I have established the system, so
far as 1 have gone, on a hrm foundation;
we are taking in new houses
nearly every day, and, in spite of the
hiuh urice of cotton, it would astonish
you to kuow how much is being stored.
The present State administration favors
retaining the system on its present
basis, while I favor its development
upon broader lines. 1 can not
sueceed with opposition from the State
administration.
Admits Achievements.
"Another reason why I wish to retire
is that I am tired of public life.
Twenty-five years ago, when I went to
Washington, I found negroes in nearly
?M'"' Hi' flf Ifie postoflices, and our people I
were restless and resentful uuder this
condition of affuirs It finally culminated
in the burning of a postmaster
in this State and in Mississippi, and
had there not been a change there i>
no telling what might have occurred.
I set myself to work with the determination
that, no matter what the cost
was to me personally, 1 wouid rerneu.)
this condition of affairs. The oin.?
way to do it was to gam the respect
and confidence of those in authority,
and make them see what was right.
Personally it did me no good, and was
a great burden, but the benefit was
not confined to South Carolina. The
policy which 1 succeeded in getting
McKiuley to inaugurate, and Kooseveit
to carry on, was extended to ever.v
Southern State, and lias practical^
settled the negro question so far us
politics is concerned. My reward wa?
the charge 011 the floor of the senate
by iny colleague that 1 had sold out
for patronage. I advocated the principle
of ship subaidy for an American
merchant submarine, and pointed out
then what would happen to the South
if there was ever a European war. 1
was the first man in high public office
in this State to point out und opi?ose
the Democratic party following Mr.
Bryan in his erroneous views on finance.
Bead the platform of the
party today and see whether my views
have prevailed or not.
"In the present campaign there \va>
not a candidate for governor in the
field who suited me. I begged you to
run 011 the industrial issue, and offered
to run for governor myself if
you would run for lieutenant governor.
When it was narrowed down to
Blease und Manning. I supported
Blease. and would do so again under
similar circumstances, because i knew
that I could develop the warehouse
system and secure a rural credit*
measure with Blease and that I could
never move a i?eg with Manning.
When I made up my mind to fight for
Blea.se I did not do it in a half hearted
way, and I believe riirht now that
if I had not got sick and had to spend
a month in the hospital hut could
have continued my canvass of this
State, that we would have won the
fight on the first ballot. However,
what is to be will be. and 1 am not
crying over spilt milk.
Archbold Correspondence,
"Senator Tillman refers to a letter
I wrote Mr. Archbold, which he construes
into asking for a campaign
contribution, when he and I resigned
to fight it out 20 years ago. 1 have
explained in the public prints the eir
cumstances under which this letter
was written, and so long as my conscience
is clear 1 care little what any
one else thinks of me. I might reply
to Senator Tillman by calling attention
to charges <>f corruption
against him, which he lias not and
can never satisfactorily explain. This
I will not do. liecause he can not
help acting as he did in this cain%
ign
Warehouse" Po&

assassin ami reputation tliiof, and
even now, wlieu in dread of death
lie is trying to be a better man, reverts
to liis primal instincts.
"1 aui interested in tire material
progress of South Carolina. 1 believe
that good government and
civilization follow in the wake of
prosperity. It matters not about me;
rileasc and Tillman are minor incidents
about which I care naught
politically, except as they further or
retard what 1 am trying to make my
life work.
"The State Warehouse system has;
"1. Demonstrated how easy it is to
transform cotton iu tofreotiable
security.
"J. it has established a new fact
in economics, to wit, that you can
valorize products within certaiu
limits by giving thein special privileges
as a collateral.
"o. After the failure of the Wade
plan, it pointed out the true way
to make effective the federal reserve
law on commodity loans. I have 011
tile in this office letters from the
president of the United States, the
secretary of the treasury and the
president of the federal reserve board
in Washington, which atuplv confirm
these statements.
lte<ietits of Warehouses.
"If we never take another step,
the State warehouse law has done
more for the people than all of the
self-seeking, mouthy politicians in
South Carolina have accomplished
since 1ST0. If I felt that my presence
here was. an absolute necessity
i would smother my natural feelings
of indignation and continue to sacrifice
myself, but I think that I now
have the system where a good, sensible
man can run it upon its pres
cut basis of furnishing a collateral,
if there is any further attempt to
develop it, 1 stand ready as an outsider,
to do all in my power to assist
w hoever may be in charge. What
it needs now is:
"1. Licensed graders.
"2. Direct sales.
"3. To liecome self- '- '(^porting,
"the insurance, properly handled
i?y the legi.Muture, can be made to
support the system and furnish aid
111 establishing direct sales. Few
realize the tremendous profits made
upon insurance. We have paid out

on the same plan that 1 um
working it now or the State might
eeome co-insurer and divide the
.iremiums with the same companies
ihat are now carrying our cotton or
others .with which arrangements
night be made.
Licensed Grading.
"There is one thought in connection
vvith licensed graders to which I 'ail
our attention. At the time the Sta^e
warehouse system started, there
io federal law upon the subject of
trades. If we adopted the standard
trades of the department of agriculure,
and saw that they were enforced,
ither through federal or State law.

it tempt to resume >jierio |<a.vineiits

between this country and Europe
threatened to become prohibitive
(.f all trade. England tried to sus#
/
tuia the exchange value of the p<
sterling by selling back the set
billions of dollars of American se<
ties held abroad.
"The demand for war material
foodstuffs, however, was so great
I within two. years America has bo

OF THE STATE nv
)r ?:? ed
Senator Tillman Asks That Faetionalid

!? The News and Courier has received an
& from Senator Tillman for publication th
the following: so
To the People of South Carolina: B1
a' The election is over. Manning is re- to,
ie nominated, and Blease has misses the ne
third term he coveted so much. I hope in:
that I will not be misunderstood if, th
as your old and trusted servant, I T1
m m^ie a few observations and give th
some advice. ly
!n There are approximately 65,000 to
^ South Carolians who wanted Blease
for Governor despite his record,
and I am convinced that 45,000, or m;
more of these voters are good men
and true. They voted for Blease here
cause they honestly believed he was p<
the better of the two candidates. I
know they were mistaken, wofully
mistaken, but they would have been
g. recreant in their duty to the State
|Q had they not voted as their conjg
sciences dictated. There are too many Sei
e voters not to alive to their duty as citi- ca
ta zens, and they were easily mislead Cli
y by a selfish demagogue. Lack of
i- thought, not viciiusne8s, was respon- th
ts Bible for the hold that Blease got on flr
re the people. They did not stop to an- f0]
1- alyze the difference between demagogy th
l- and statemanshlp. Being honest and pb
o straightforward themselves, they did eB
y not suspect Blease. His striking per- WJ
r- sonality, his ability as a stump speak. th
re er, and his genius for organization
n were to much for them. When he vj(
13 proclaimed himself the heir of Tillman be
^ and the Reform movement, these 45,- UE
D 000 good men took him at his word
and followed him. History is full of
like instances.
18 It grieved me to see so many of cl)
? my old friends bamboozled by Blease, gl
l* but I know their hearts are right and ar
3- wr
that in time they will see the differD
i'?
ence between true Tillmanism and otH
Let
e false?the kind that Blease teaches.
The old Reformers were blinded and nc
misled, but, at the same time, their
^ ardent and unselfish support of what
l8 they thought were the principles I
L3 taught them long ago excited my ad- m
ft miration, respect and affecHop. In |V,
y their splendid loyalty to true democ- W]
^ racy as they see it lies at once the
promise and the hope of good gov
eminent in South Carolina. Let a real
statesman arise, and these men will ?
HX'
be even more loyal to him then they la
t- were to Blease?and as they always u
's were to me. M
For Blease himself and his chief
a- lieutenants I have noting but scorn di
id and contempt. McLaurii^, Talbert, ^
it Browning and others of their kind
m
>n knew in their hearts that Blease was ^
ig thoroughly bad, but they followed him A]
'e because they thought they could thus I tJ(
is further their own selfish ends. They ^
re believed it was a "ground swell" like ^
that of 1890, and wanted to get on
16 the "band wagon," as so many men did
D? then?"driftwood," 1 called them, you
t? remember.
D
Q" Now that the election is over, look
8t calmly down into your own hearts? ^
* I am speaking to the 45,000 patriotic
re Blease men?and see if your position
i(* was well taken. The heat of the con- a.
r. sb
flict is past, and you can now see clear- ^
a ly. Ask yourselves?nobody need
know you are doing it?why all the ^
tin-iron gamblers, all the blind tigers, 1,1
all the red light habitues, all the crim- .
ly tn
er inals and near-criminals?those who tQ
u have been pardoned and those not yet
gm caught and convicted?were for Blease.
^ What have you in common with these
13 men, these vicious parasites on the ^
0f body politic. Nothing; for you are cg
good men and they are bad.
There are those who have said that
re the Reform movement was responsible 1q
n for Bleaseism. I, as the leader and ,
' ki
h- organizer of that revolution, deny the ~
id charge. The Reform movement had
lr certain definite, constructive aims in
view, 1. To teach the people the
n. power of the ballot and thus "ree
d. the State from an oligarchy which
8t had ruled it for a hundred years. 2. To E;
lie provide means for educating the en!W
larged electorate. 3. To safeguard m
to the State, as far as possible, from
negro participation in politics. "By lo
n* their fruits ye shall know them." I w
to point to the primary system of elcctions,
to Clemson and Winthr.jp ccl- 11
ks leges, and to the Constitution of 1895
u~ as the fulfilment of the purposes of ^
the Reform movement. The positive.
a* ness of 1890 never coud have pro- j
lr duced the negation of 1910 and 1912. yf
, He who charges that Tillmanism j.0
18 gave legitimate birth to Bleaseism ex- it
presses his own disbelief in democ
IX ? ?
jjj racy. The Reform movement maue me j,e
people of the State free political m
agents. Will anybody dare deny that
that was a good thing? "Government
derives Its just powers from the con
sent of the governed." Tillmanism pJ
ry gave the ballot to the people and
er taught them its potency?which all ?r
Democrats must admit was right ami
ay proper; it is not responsible for the ^
er mistaken use of a rightful power. I cj
im am a Democrat, and the defeat of de
sd. Blease in 1914 and 1916 renews my he
- \ <
' r v o v x
ith in the people. If the Reform
ovement elected Blease, what defeathlm?
I am growing old, and before I die
would like to see the people of 1
iuth Carolina forget their differences
.d bury factionalism. Factions *are
e result of misunderstanding and
cial injustice. Let all the people?
easites and anti-Bleasites?come
gether in a spirit of mutual helpt'ul88,
clearing up the misunderstandgs
and working together to remedy
e injustices that are but too many,
le vast majority of both factions?

e regeneration of Mexico. Another
legram to Mr. Cabrera was said to
ive been by Gen. Carrauza, comanding
his envoys to drop all reform
lk and huiry up the border settle?nt.
After the morning coiiferenet
r. Cabrera said:
"These stories of the commission's
scussion of Mexican internal affairs
scouragea me very much. The comission's
only business is to arrange
r the protection of the border. The
atericans have asked certain ques>ns
about other things, and it would
ive been discourteous for us not to
ive furnished this information.
"More talk about such matters, bower,
is no part of our official work."
The threatened rupture of today has
sen developing for several days. Last
ght one of the Carranza delegation
sgan to complain that the Americans
d not realize that the Mexicans were
proud race. He was linally stopped
sort by an American who said: "Tnat
just the trouble. You have more
ide than common sense. You are too
oud even to let us heip you."
The Mexican repied: "Every time
e United States had had anything
-i- ?..? + !. ornt thfi worst of it.
UU WIIU UO ?v/ o
e cannot forget tliat we lost Calirnia
and Texas."
The attack of Villa's troops in Chilahua
was interpreted by the Mexims
as most favorable to Carranza.
tiey said that Carranza's troops had
therto experienced great difficulty in
eating Villa. Now that Gen. Trevino
tew where the bandit chieftain was
ie would pursue Villa into the rnoun,1ns
relentlessly."
How Many Steps in A Mile.
schauge.
How many steps do you take to the
ile? Should you be a British inntryman
your pace will be the
ugest of any infantryman in the
orld. The Russians' pace is the
lortest, being 27 1-2 inches, the
rench, Italian and Austrian pace is
> inches, the Germans do 21 inches,
hilst the English stride an extra
ilf inch.
But your own pace, what <>f it?
depends upon your height. Take
ur eyebrow height, half it, and that
presents your pace. You will find
to be somewhere between 30 inches
id 32 inches, so tint you will need
tween 2,000 and 2,100 paces to the
lie.

Senator Predicts Short Crop.
Juuior Memuers Accepts Invitation to
Speait lor IresiUent Wilson
in Middle West.
Columbia, Sept. lb.?E. D. Smith,
juuior United States senator from this
State, cume to Columbia from his home
in Florence yesterday to attend the
funeral of Airs. Annie Howe, sister of
President Wiisou. He returned to
Florence yesterduy afternoon.
Nert month Senator Smith will give
much of his tune campaigning for the
presidential nominees of the Democratic
party. Early in the campaign
be had been listed for a tour of two
weens through the Eastern division.
1'esterday he received a telegram
from Senator Kern of Indiana, urging
that he join the Chicago division for
a series of speaking engagements before
th fgncuiturui masses of the
Central West. Mr. Smith accepted
tbe invitation.
Cotton and problems incident to the
marketing of the crop have aiways
been of votal interest to Senator * *
Smith, but he was never at any time
more concerned than just now over
the prospect for unprecedented high
prices .'^Although, trade relations!
line year ago were disrupted by a
world war, we consumed 4,000,000
bales of cotton in excess of an 11,100,000
bale crop," he said. "This
year the surplus has been exhausted
mid we will market not more than
10,000,000 bales. Uur own State will
not gin more than 50 per cent, of last
year's figures. A concrete illustration
is my own crop. 1 have 32 acres from
which 1 have picked each year from
& to 30 bales. This fall I'll probably
Prices to be paid for this year's
crop are wholly in the hands of the
farmers, Senator Smith emphasized. f\v
An extremely small crop and that sec- tlon
of the federal reserve act
whereby cotton was made a liquid
u.xsot, render this possible. All the
farmers have to do is to store their
cotton in a manner acceptable to a
member bank of the federal system.
With this assurance from the memoer
bunk, the feueral reserve ac?
provides that a large percentage

vunced six mouths by the regional
reserve bank. Last yeear $40 was
advanced to the bale. Prices then
were eight and 10 cents. "With cotton
selling at 15 cents throughout the
South, an advance of $00 ought to
be had," Seuutor Smith said.
Another point stressed was that '
liic warehouses did not have to be
nuked up with the State warehouse
system. The federal reserve act was
passed long before a warehouse act
was placed ou the statute books of
South Carolina, aud the only requireuieut
imposed was that the cottou
shall be stored in a manner acceptable
to the member bank. Senator
Smith was uuthor of that section and
could speak with authority as to exactions.
Another issue on which Senator
Smith thinks the people should bestir
themselves is the acquisition of
the $20,000,1100 nitrate plant as receutly
provided for in congress. Selection
of the site has been left with
President Wilson. Senator Smith
was the author of the bill uud fought
for its pasage through both houses
of congress, uud be.ieves that with a
superabundance of water power aud
mineral dei-.-its and proper distribution
facilities mar the iields for consumption
the State has more than
an equal chance to procure the plant,
if the people of the State vigorously
light for its establishment here.
