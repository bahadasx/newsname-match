Regarding the Maine election
both the democratic and republi
can parties express themselves as
being entirely satisfied. The re
publicans say that it presages the
election of Hughes, while the dem
ocrats say that inasmuch as Maine
is normally a republican state the
small majority of the republicans
simply shows that Hughes is weak
and that Wilson will win. There
is no question but that the pro
gressives stood by the republican
ticket, and if they should do that
throughout the United States
Wilson will have a close shave if
he wins.
As long as civil service law is in
existance it does not matter which
party i in power, so far at least
is the Indians are concerned. If
they want relief from the thral
om of civil service employees
they must look to congress to pass
such legislation as will secuie this,
for them.
"Every "Indian in^'the" country
should appeal to congress at its
next session to relieve the situa
tion by passing a law that will
limit the powers assumed by field
employees.
Congress should be asked to
pass a law prohibiting *the shoot
ing upon Indian reservations of
prairie chickens. If this is not
done the birds will soon become
exlinct. It is noticable that within
ten years the chickens have been
killed off every year in such large
numbers by non reservation hunt
ers that very few of them can now
be found upon this reservation.
The laws against hunting which
are so rigidly enforced against an
Indian who ventures to kill any
game outside of the reservation
without a license should cause the
Indians to insist upon the enforce
ment of the United States law
which prohibits any one but an
Indian to hunt on a reservation.
Until hunters from the cities, who
Vare invited upon this reservation
to hunt by men who themselves
have not the right, commenced to
jnake this reservation their hunt
ing field theie was much game up
on it, but now even ducks are be
coming scarce, and there are
practically no deer.
A debating society should be
organized here in order to give
youn men and women an oppor
tunity for instructive pleasure and
recreation, and that they may also
help to elevate conditions upon
this reservation.
Durir.g the regime of E. P.
Smith as Indian agent here his
employees organized a debating
society which met once each week,
and the young members of the
reservation at that time looked
forward to these meetings with
pleasure. Some energptic young
men should make an effort to or
ganize another debating society.

Minnesota Should Have
An Indian Agency.
In Minnesota there are two In
dian reservations and nine ced*
reservations. The reservations are
White Earth and Red Lake, and
the ceded reservations are Missis
sippi, Leech Lake, Cass Lake,
Winnebegosish, Boisforte or Deer
River, Fond du Lac, Mille Lac,
Grand Portage, and Nett Like.
Upon these reservations and ceded
reservations there are between
eleven and twelve thousand Chip
pewas. These Chippewas are pay
ing from their tribal funds about
ten thousand dollars for salaries
to superintendents at the follow
ing named places: White Earth,
Red Lake, Leech Lake, Cass Lake,
Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, and
at Nett Lake.
It is not in the provisions of the
Act of 1889, under which the
Chippewas ceded their reserva
tions, that their tribal funds de
rived from the sale of these reser
tions should be expended in main
taining superintendences upon
each of the reservations that were
ceded, but the commission which
negotiated with the Chippewas for
their assent to the act made the
latter believe the money would be
paid to them without qualifica
tions. When one of the late chiefs
asked how the Indians from other
reservations would be removed to
this reservation and under whose
expense, Chairman Rice, of tha
.-commission, said the govei amen
would provide for this. Thismay
be recalled by many who were
present at the meetings, and in
any event it is a matter of record
in the report of the proceedings
before the commission.
Every superintendency should
be abolished in the Chippewa
country and an Indian agency
should be established in this state
which would have charge of all the
reservations and ceded reserva
tions.
It is not only absurd to have
superintendents at Cass Lake,
Fond du Lac, Grand Portage and
Nett Lake, but it is a waste of
Chippewa funds.
It is very important that steps
should be taken by the Chippewas
of Minnesota, through their dele
gation that will probably be ap
pointed to go to Washington next
winter by the president of the
Ciippewa General Council, to urge
the passage of a bill that will es
tablish an Indian agency in this
state and abolish superintenden
ces. Seven or eight years ex
perience with superintendents up
on the Chippewa reservations in
this state has taught the Chippe
was that these superintendents
with their large number of clerks
are a gre.it expense without an
equivalent being obtained in re
turn. In fact the old policy of
having Indian agencies is one that
every Indian tribe prefers to the
failures of superintendents who in
a large majority of cases are in
competent to fill the positions they
hold, and have shown themselves
unequil to the task.
__
Should Segregate Chip
pewa Funds.
Over 6even hundred thousand
dollars wan added to the Chippe
wa tribal fund now In the treasury
last week by an appropriation by
congress through the efforts of
Washington officials, and which
was the amount awarded in the
jvsr ^{^^wv ^6W'w^^^^^^!:^^rv^TiS,^*?^"'s,!!,''
'V^'-
o'
Mille Lac suit by the Court of
Claims.
The members of the tribe who
have devoted twenty years of hard
work and expended many thous
ands of dollars in their efforts to
recover the amount which the
court awarded, and during that
period had the most aggressive
opposition of the Indian office and
the Department of Justice to con
tend with, wished to have the
amount paid immediately in a
manner that would be beneficial to
the Indians interested instead of
having it paid in munificient sal
aries to employees many of whom
are incompetent or hold sinecure
positions. But the officials were
able to get the appropriation as
they had planned, and the money
is now almost as safely stowed
away in the public treasury as
though there had been no Mille
Lac suit, and the probable result
will be that it will be paid to white
employees instead of to the Chip
pewas.
To the members of the tribe
who have worked so hard and
earnestly to get the amount award
ed it seems as though their work
had resulted in absolutely nothing
in favor of the Mille Lac Chip
pewas, and that they had simply
devoted their time and money for
the benefit of the continuation of
white employees.
The only recourse now left to
the Chippewas is to try and induce
congress to segregate the tribal
funds of the Chippewas of Minne
sota now in the treasury so that
each member of the tribe will
have placed to his credit the
amount to which he is entitled.
Only in this way can the fur
ther waste of Chippewa funds be
stopped.
Every effort should also be
made to secure an accounting from
the Indian and Land offices for the
amount of the tribal funds which
they have expended since 1889.
Raise Funds To Tesl
TheLaw.
If the sentiment upon this res
ervation is as strong in favor of
enforcing the recent law which
gives the Chippewas of Minnesota
the preference as employees in the
Chippewa Indian service as it is at
this village, steps should be taken
to raise by subscription or other
wise a sufficient sum of money to
employ an attorney at Washing
ton to mandamus the Secretary of
the Interior and Commissioner of
Indian Affairs so that they would
be compelled to observe the law.
There are undoubtedly many
here who would like to see this
done but because they are seeking
positions they probably do not
care to create the prejudice against
themselves of the officials for fear
it might injure their chances of
obtaining positions if they took to
active a part.
There area few others besides
the publisher of THE TOMAHAWK
who have no favors to ask at the
hands of anv officials, and they
would no doubt be willing to take
the initiative in trying to raise
funds to enforce the law. In this
connection it is suggcsU-d that if
no one cares to contribute by sub
scription the necessary amount to
employ a Washington attorney to
try and have the law enforced, a
basket party for the purpose might
enable the promoters to raise a
sufficient amount to put the matter
to a test. This should be consid
ered, and a meeting should be held
at the White Earth Hall for the
purpose of discussing the matter
at which the ladies who are mem
bers of the reservation should be
present.

Mistakes Of Indians.
There is no question with which
the government has to deal that is
more vexatious and unsatisfactory
to it than the Indian question. It
not only has the unsatisfactory ele
ments in the Indian service to deal
with but also the unreliability of a
great many ignorant Indians, In
dians who have been spoiled by
the government officials who have
had plans of their own to carry
out for their own benefit.
The Indians who have been a
detriment to their respective tribes
are those who are known as "ware
housers This class, with the
exception of the very old and
helpless Indians, have been simply
the tools of scheming and selfish
Indian agents or superintendents
which it. in every respect the same
thing except that the official names
have been changed in order to
bring them within the classified
service.
If there were no warehouses
much of the trouble which now
exists on reservations would dis
appear, and we might add, if there
were not so many government
positions to be had there would
also be much less trouble.
The Indians themselves are much
to blame for their troubles, for as
soon as one gets a position in the
service, or is placed on the ware
house roll, he becomes a supporter
of the agent or any of the employ
ees no matter how unoopular they
may be or detrimental to the ser-
VJOP tJiey in Jact practically sell
their independence.

Sec. 2072 of the United
States Revised Statutes was pub
lished which provides that when*
an Indian tribe is, in the opinion
of the Secretary of the Interior,
competent to direct the employ
ment of their own emploj'ees, the
direction of such persons may be
given to the proper authorities of
the tribe.
Tne Chippewas of Minnesota,
and particularly those upon this
reservation, are competent to di
rect the employment of the em
ployees of the Chippewa Indian
service here, and they should take
steps to induce the Secretary of
the Interior to place the employ
ment of the persons needed under
their charge. There is a regular
J.V established local council within
this reservation, and there is in
telligence enough among the many
educated men of the reservation to
direct the employees here to the
advantage of the reservation peo
ple.
In view of the impossibility of
getting employment for members
cf the Chippewas of Minnesota
bands notwithstanding the law
recently passed by congress and
which the supeiintendent here
says can bo ignored, and which
every educated member of the
Chippewa bands know has been
ignored, the most active steps
should now be taken to try and in
duce the Secretary of the Interior
to issue an otder to put into prac
tice the section of the law herein
before referred to.

Indians Working Out Own
Problem, Says Com
missioner Sells.
STEPS FORWARD MADE IN MANY
INDUSTRIES,
Rapjd City, S. D.That most
of the Indians of the country will
in a short time be self-supporting,
was a belief expressed in an inter
view here by Cnto Sells, commis
sioner of Indian affairs, while at
tending a summer school for em
ployees of the Indian service. Mr.
Sells declared conditions on the
reservations indicate that the time
is fast approaching when the In
dian will be competent to manage
his own affairs and be divorced
from the paternal arm of the gov
ernment. The population on these
lands is increasing, he said, in
stead of decreasing, as is populai ly
supposed.
Commissioner Sells Ins an act
ive campaign under way for the
betterment of Indian homos on
several reservations, in the opin
ion that with the red man as with
the white, the home is the center
of all progressive activity. Efforts
are being made to persuade the
Indians to utilize returns from the
sales of lands and other sources
for the construction of better
dwellings.
On many of the reservations,
field matrons are constantly travel
ing from house to house teaching
wornon how to do housework, how
to cook, how to care for the sick,
