"Hell Machines.”
Now British Invention Now
Used in Battle.
Another, and probably the deadli
est of all implements used in warfare
in Europe, was recently put in action
hy the British forces.
An account given hy Frederick
Palmer of a day’s fight in which these
machines were used follows:
At the British Front, Sept. IG, via
London, Sept. 17. —With ceaseless
shell fire from unprecedented concen
trations of guns, the battle raged fur
iously all day, with the British mak
ing good their advance of yesterday,
while the Germans were rushing up
reserves from other parts of the west
ern front.
The demoralization of their infan
try yesterday hy the use of the new
British armored motorcars called
“tanks” was freely confessed hy pris
oners I talked with today.
“There was no standing against
that sort of tiling,” said one German
officer. "Of course we surrendered,
those of us who were alive. We fired
at a tank with our rilles. Our ma
chine guns were turned loose on it.
But the bullets were only blue sparks
on the armor. We thought the Brit
ish slow and stupid, despite their
courage and stubbornness, and they
gave us a surprise like this.”
A column of German prisoners
passing a “tank” rejoicing in the
nickname of “creme de menthe,”
which had returned from battle and
was resting from its labors, spread
out their bauds and shook their heads
and looked at it, exclaiming in a
chorus; “Mein Gott im Himmel!”
Is it under control? It won’t break
out and begin firing again? Will we
ever forget our first sight of the thing
as it came at us out of the morning
mist? It wasn’t war, using a piece
of machinery like that; it is butch
ery.”
To this a British officer replied:
“So, it is quite peaceable and tame
now. It has just been fed. As for
it not being war, it is quite in keep
ing with The Hague convention,
which your gas attacks at Vpres was
not.”
The Hermans themselves were
massing in at many points, it ap
pears, with a view of making attacks
to recover some high ground they
lost. The British anticipated the
Herman attack with their own on
slaughts, assisted by their new "hell
machines,” whose secret they had
been keeping up their sleeves for such
an occasion as this.
Information regarding these "tank”
cars or "hell machines” is given in
a letter from Washington, a portion
of which we reprint.
Washington, Sept. 18.-The British
"tanks” the armored motor cars
used in recent assn Its on German
trenches in Northern France so suc
cessfully as to attract world wide at
tention, were built for the most part
in Peoria, 111., in the form of cater
pillar tractors designed many years
before the war began to meet some of
the difficult problems of modern farm
ing. Except for their armor, the
machine guns and their crews, thous
ands like them are in use today in
the United States, plowing, digging
ditches, and performing other labors
less heroic than war.
M. M. Baker, vice-president of the
Holt Manufacturing Company, ex
plained here today that it was ma
chines made by his company at its
Peoria plant that had hurdled Ger
man trenches, walked through forests
aud crawled over shell craters in the
face of intense gun fire.
"It is true,’’saidMr. Baker, "that
these tractors can go ahead over al
most anything or through almost any
thing. They can straddle a trench,
go through a swamp, roll over a climb
through shell craters like a car of
Juggernaut. It looks uncanny to
see them crawl along the ground just
like a huge caterpillar. In a thick
forest if they encounter trees they
could not brush out of their way they
could easily be used to uproot them
and clean their own paths.”
Mr. Baker said the tractors sent to
England weigh about 18,000 pounds
each, develop 120 hotsepower, and
are built of steel. The caterpillar
feature, he explained, is of the ut
most importance. Speaking broadly,
the tractor crawls on two belts, with
Use Blight-Killed Chestnut
Washington, Sept. 20.-According
to the Forest Service there is no
reason why farmers and.other wood
land owners in the East whose timber
has been attacked by the chestnut
blight should not make use of the
killed and infected timber. Such
material, it is claimed, has been
found after three years’ trial to he as
durable as that which the blight has
attacked, hut should always be peeled
before being used.
Experiments conducted at Water
hury, Conn., and MountGretna, Pa.,
to determine t he value of the diseased
wood have shown that blight-killed
, and infected chestnut is just as dur
able as the healthy timber and is con
sequently equally valuable. These
experiments, say the foresters, show
that there need be no hesitation a
bout using wood affected by the blight
for any purpose to which chestnut is
suited.
The material used in the experi
ments consists of posts, poles, and
ties, troth from infected and healthy
chestnut. After three years’ use,
the infected timber is as sound as
that which was not affected. Even
the lesions caused hy the attacks of
the blight have withstood decay,
except below ground, it is reported.
All of the material used was found in
good condition, except for the deter
ioration of the knots and of tire sap
wood, which in the chestnut is not
durable.
The blight-killed timber which had
seasoned on the stump for several
years and which had lost its bark
was not removed. No difference be
tween peeled pieces of timber, infect
ed hut not killed, and healthy mater
ial could he distinguished.
No one should make the mistake
of thinking that the blight-killed
timber is worthless, the foresters say.
Farmers can effect considerable econ
omy hy utilizing material of this sort
for poles, posts, fencing and the like,
while lumber sawed from blight-killed
trees is in no way inferior to that
from healthy trees.
Apple Crop Smaller.
Washington, Sept. IG.-The apple
crop for 191G will le 9,000,000 bar
rels smaller than last year’s produc
tion, according to the forecast of the
Bureau of Crop Estimates announced
today. The total production for
this year is placed at 07,679,000
barrels of three bushels, against 70,-
070,000 barrels last year.
Last year only 05 per cent, of the
crop was sold. The crop this year is
larger in the Atlantic Coast States
and on the Pacific Slope, hut is smaller
in the interior apple states of the
Middle West.
Virginia and West Virginia, which
have been developed into great apple
states in the past 10 years, led the
country in the production of a num
ber of varieties this year. Maryland,
which also grows a largo number of
apples in the western part of the
State, did not fare so well this year.
In the production of the winesaps
Virginia takes a long lead in this
year’s forecast. Of the estimated
production of 3,794,000 barrels, Vir
ginia will produce 911,000 while of
the 1,380,000 barrels of the Staymen
winesap, Virginia’s production is
given at 251,(XX) barrels, leading all
other states. Virginia also leads in
the production of the yellow Newton
pippin, raising 383,000 barrels of the
total of 1,277,000 barrels throughout
the country. Virginia also produced
more York Imperials than any other
state, her crop being 778,000 barrels
of the total 2,403,000 produced.
West Virginia takes the lead in the
production of Rome Beauties, produc
ing 572,000 barrels, or one-fifth of
the total crop.
corrugated surfaces, on either side of
the body. The corrugated surface is
on the ground, On the inside of the
belts, on each side of the body, are
two lines of steel rails, making four
lines in all. These rails are in short
sections, jointed, and operate over a
cogged mechanism that actually lays
them down with their belt attach
ment as the tractor moves ahead and
picks them up again, so that the car
runs on its own self-made track con
tinuously. The short joints in the
rails make it easy to turn to right or
left.
16-Inch Shell Through House.
Washington, Sept. 15.-A steel shell
fired from one of Uncle Sam’s new
IG-inch guns, the type of rifle which
will de placed at the Cap Henry
fortress to guard Baltimore, Wash
ington and other ('hesapeak Bay cit
ies, pierced the thickest armor plate
made, glanced off a sandbank, hurtl
ed through the air for several miles
and partially demolished the frame
house of Mrs. Mary Swann, near
Indian Head, Md., according to a
report received hy the Navy Depart
ment.
Mrs. Swann and her two little girls
narrowly escaped being torn to pieces
hy the shell. It crashed through
the kitchen, which Mrs. Swann and
children had just left to eat dinner
in the dining room.
As a result of this and oilier simi
lar accidents at Indian Head, Acting
Secretary of tire Navy Roosevelt de
clared this afternoon that the Navy
Department intended to move its big
gun testing plant to some other sec
tion out of the reach of civilization
as soon as Congress appropriates the
money.
Hughes’ Special Beats Flyers.
A special train carrying Charles E.
Hughes on his second Presidential
campaign trip rolled into Cleveland,
022 miles from New York, at 7.20
o’clock Monday night, having made
tire trip in less than 12i hours at an
average speed of 50 miles an hour,
including stops. At Buffalo, I*2
miles from Cleveland, the Hughes
special had beaten the running time
of the fastest express on the line hy
almost 30 minutes.
Big Strike Threatened.
From reports in Daily papers it
looks as though New York City trac
tion lines and huisness in general
will be tied up this week. The trac
tion employes are now on a strike
and it is stated that 700,000 union
workers will strike in sympathy with
the traction men.
1,000 Wolves Slain In County.
Duluth, Minn., Sept. IS.-Bounties
aggregating 815,000 on 1,000 wolves
were earned by hunters in St. Louis
county in the last 15 months, accord
ing to an audit completed today.
Last winter the deep snow made it
comparatively easy to kill them.
Many were destroyed with clubs and
were run down by dogs.
For making false statements con
cerning his age in order to secure a
pustollice position, Michael Levin
was found guilty in a Chicago Court.
He was fined 1 cent and sentenced
to 2 minutes imprisonment in a
courtroom chair.
It is stated that the Baltimore City
would pass an ordinance permitting
Sunday baseball should the pending
measure be kept off the ballots at the
coming election.
Toddies Kill Baby.
As the result of an overdose of alcohol
administered by the mother in an effort
to relieve the suffering of her child, the
five-month-old child of Mrs. Nora Delau
ter died on Sunday at Montevue Hospital.
A coroner’s jury, Justice Henry H.
Maulsby presiding, Monday morning, ex
onerated the mother from all blame in
connection with the death of the child.
The institution was also exonerated from
all blame by the jury.

11 AN EXPERIMENT
By FANNY GRAY.
After two weeks of blissful honey
tuoou In bis modest new home, Hurry
I Curr firmly believed that all newspa
per Jokes about newlyweds. Including
1 wife’s biscuits, crunky cook stoves,
burned steak and the like, were Just
newspaper Jokes and nothing more.
Of course, there was a maid In the
kitchen, but Hurry never doubted foi|
a moment that It was bis bride, Molly,
who really made It possible for these
wouders to be evolved.
Now, Molly had about as much con
fidence In her own ability In the kitch
en as Harry hud, although she hud
never been put severely to the test,
where everything depended upon her
alone. So, when Bridget’s first day out
arrived, she and Hurry both looked for
ward to It us a sort of lark. As they
were drinking their coffee that morn
ing, the following conversation took
place:
“Now don’t go and try to get up a
regular dinner tonight, honey. I'm eat
! Ing too much, anyway. And I won’t
have you getting all hoi and tired
working over a stove 1”
“That’s very sweet of you, Hurry,
but don't imagine that we can’t have
dinner just because Bridget is out. 1
shall enjoy getting It. And I don’t
think much of wives who set out cold
bites because they're lazy. You’ll seel’’
“All right, pet, suit yourself, but bo
ready on time, and If the dinner is very
good, I might have something In my
pocket. It might be tickets for the
Hippodrome 1”
“Oh, how lovely I Of course I'll bo
on time. Don’t miss the early train I”
In the middle of the afternoon, Mol
ly descended to the kitchen, clad In a
neat blue linen dress, and tackled the
, dinner.
About half-past five, Mrs. Webster,
a near neighbor, who had made friends
at once with Molly, rung the bell of
■ the Carrs’ house. Molly answered, sat
down with her culler, and apologized
for her dress. But she was so evident
ly nervous and left the •oom so many
times on one excuse or another that
her experienced friend oogan to realize
that something must be wrong with the
kitchen arrangements.
At last the truth came out and Mol
ly explained her predicament, between
tears and laughter.
“Why, Mrs. Webster,” she cried, “It
never occurred to me I couldn’t get a
whole dinner alone 1 I’ve done lots
of cooking 1”
“Come on out and let's see how bad
It Is,” suggested Mrs. Webster.
It did seem rather hopeless. On the
tables lay a flerce-looklng collection of
cooking utensils and dishes, all soiled.
Mrs. Webster peered Into everything,
while Molly explained. Mock bisque
soup being Hurry's favorite, she had
decided upon that, and had made It
early to have It out of the way. There
It stood on the buck of the stove, a
fine curdled mess, “keeping hot.”
The roust beef she had put on good
and early In the new double roaster,
laboring under the delusion that the
Invention absolved one from giving any
further attention to the meat. A glance
at It, Just before her neighbor’s arriv
al, had revealed a little, drled-up, hard
piece of beef, utterly unfit to serve,
Molly and Mrs, Webster looked at
each other a moment and then cleared
the atmosphere by laughing Immod
erately. When Molly could get her
breath, she said:
“What shall I dot Of course, my
pride Is hurt, and I hate to tell Harry,
but I suppose I must.”
“Why tell him that you tried to get
a dinner at all? He has suggested the
theater, you say. It would be most
natural for yon to have a light supper
to save trouble, as you may be going
out”
“But I told him this morning I
didn’t mind the trouble, and that I
was going to got dinner."
“Never mind. People sometimes
change their minds. I don’t want to
corrupt your morals, but I advise you
to do as I say. If yon will, I can help
you out."
Molly nodded assent
“Good 1 Now, what salad have you
got?”
“Lettuce and tomato.”
“Couldn’t be better. Any canned
soup In the house?" t
“Only ready-made tomato."
“The very thing I Haven’t you
learned the secret of putting hot milk
and n bit of butter to that Just before
serving? Very likely It will be mis
taken for your own brand of bisque.”
“Great I You’re a wonder, Mrs. Web
ster.”
“No, Just nn old housekeeper. Now,
I’ve got cold bam and a cream cheese
I can spare, and I’m going to send
them over. If by uny chance you have
your dessert, don't you see that with
a pot of coffee you’ll have a delicious
and hearty supper, after all?”
At 6:30 Harry was met at the door
by a smiling bride. He held up un en
velope, teaslngly, high above her head.
“Do 1 get some food, or do we stay
at home tonight? No nice dinner, no
Hippodrome, you know.”
“I guess I can get dressed In time,”
said Molly demurely, and, hand In
hand, like two children, they went Into
the dining room.
As Harry took the last swallow of
the delicious, plplng-hot coffee, he re
marked ;
“Bully supper, Molly. Took my ad
vice, after all, didn't you? I’m glad
you didn't spend the afternoon fussing
over a hot dinner."
Molly smiled at him across the table.
