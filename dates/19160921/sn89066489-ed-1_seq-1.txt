Monday afternoon when it was
learned that the conference of the

his congregation thought that it,
would lie a fine thing to show
the esteem in which they hold him
and their gratification at his be
ing sent to Butler for another
year by going in a body to the
depot and meeting the 8 o'clock
train on which he was supposed
to return. They went to the de
pot prepared to welcome 'home a
popular preacher. The train
came in. hut .no Kev. AVolfe.
Thinking that perhaps they had
in some way missed him they all
marched down lown to the par
sonage, where Mrs. Wolfe in
formed them -that he had not. ar
rived. The members of the con
gregation dispersed 1 4 1 their vari
ous homes knowing that liev.
Wolfe would appreeiate the spirit
that prompted the home coming
welcome when he learned of it.
