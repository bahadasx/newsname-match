LETTERS FROM THI
.Mr. Iyaer Writes Interesting Letter.
September 11, 1916. t
I)Dear Doctor: I
I am sending you under separate
cover a very good view of Mare
Island. Navy Yard and the City of
Vallejo, California.
As the New Orleans Navy Yard is
now classed as Ship Building Plant.
I thought you might want to show "
your many friends what the Mare
Island Navy Yard looks like and I
having a great interest in my old
home town I knew of no better one
to send it to than the Algiers Herald,
as I know it reaches more homes in I
Algiers than any other newspaper.t
The naval force at the New Orleans
Station I know will take much inter- t
est in it as many of them have been
out here.
Thanking you in advance and I
wishing the Herald the best of luck
and that the time is not far off when
the New Orleans Navy Yard will'
rank with the Mare Island Navy
Yard.
I remain yours respectfully.

ees Association operate the ferry be- t
tween Vallejo and Mare Island, hav
ing taken over the franchise aboutI
one year ago and have reduced the a
fare from $2.50 per month to $1.00
per month and are making money f
at that. How is this for working
men. S. G. D.
NOTE. I
Rlegarding the last paragraph of
Mr. Dyer's letter in which he speaks h
of reducing the ferriage from $2.50 fi
a month to $1.00 a month by the
employees taking over the franchise
shows what can be done here in our t
tistrict While L'- ,how in. at the
ferry between Vallejo and Mare
Island is 150 per cent, we believe
that we will be able to make a much
larger showing here should the ferry
franchise be taken over by the city!
and operated for the benefit of the!
people instead of for the benefit of
the corporation. We thank Mr. Dyer
very much for making note of this as
it is a subject that the Algiers peo-1
ple are much interested in at pres- b
ent. For the information of those .
interested we will state that The n

KAI sER'S BODYG1'UARD BECOMES
('ITIZEN.
The kaiser lost another of his for
mer bodyguard Monday when Henry
Moorman. a baker's helper, went
into the Federal Court and obtained
his final papers in his naturalization
as an American citizen.
Moorman is six feet two inches
tall, and on account of his size was
selected as a member of the kaiser's
bodyguard while in the German
army. He was one of the best rifle
shots in Germany and was decorated
for his skill.
Nine years ago Moorman came to
America in charge of a shipment of
Holstein cattle from Holstein, Ger
many. and landed in Baltimore. This
country looked so good to him that
he decided to stay, and took out his
first papers in naturalization in Bal- -
timore. A short while later he re
moved to Pascagoula. Miss., and
three years ago came to Algiers. lie
spent about a year at Bay Adam,
