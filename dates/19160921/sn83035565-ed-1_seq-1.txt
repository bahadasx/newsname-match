Autumn begirs next Saturday,
but freezing temperatures came
before summer pruled. The frost
of last Saturday morning did
targe damage to the tobacco and
coi n crops, as well as to other
vegetation. On account of late
p'anting and dry weather there
was cousideiable corn and tobac
co immature, to, which prat dam
age will result." ' Many " tobacco"!
farmers will, in lar?e measure,
lose their summer's work from
the freeze.

CJH APT
DR. HARVEY W. WILEY
TO VOTE FOR HUGHES.
He Say Wilion Has Failed to Enforce
Pure Food Law.
"I favor the elp: tion or Mr. Hughes
to the Presidency for entirely different
reasons than those held by most of his
..int.A.fn.c! Tt- u ii. Viifi nao nf tha 1 4
Mexican poli ;.- nor the foreign policy
of the administration nor by reason of
Its domestic policies. It is because of
the apparent indifference of the admin
istration of President Wilson to the
cause of pure foods and drugs. Prac
tically all of the abuses which were
injected into the pure food law by the
preceding administrations are still in
force. Benzoate of soda is still reg
nant. The fumes of burning sulphur
are marching along undisturbed. There
is evidently a lull ia the activities of
the administration of the law. A well
known beverage, declared by the su
preme court mlsbranded and amenable
to the food law has not been molested.
No attempt has been made to enforce
the law in regard to the bleaching of
flour. The repeal of the mixed flour
law, that splendid safeguard to the
purity of our bread, has been tacitly
approved y the treasury department.
"Mr. Hughes In his activities on the
supreme court has stood like a stone
wall for the proper administration of
the food law. I believe his election
would see a radical change in the atti
tude of the government towards pure
food and pure drugs, so vital to the
welfare of our people. Tor this reason
I sincerely hope that Mr. Hughes may
be chosen as our next president.
"I should expect Mr. Hughes as pres
ident to have the same attitude toward
the pure food and drug law that he had
as a judge on the bench and to appoint
a secretary of agriculture with subor
dinate officers who would be enthusi
astic and earnest in the enforcement
of the pure food law for the benefit of
the physical, mental and moral wel
fare of our people."
