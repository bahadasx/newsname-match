ATTHE U.A.C.
Tho second day of registration nt
tho Utah Agricultural Collego closed
yonterday afternoon with a substan
tial increase In registration over the
Minio day last ear. Thoro was a
marked Increase in new students, the
lurgest freshman class in tho history
of tho Institution registering. The
large numbor of graduates from oth
er colleges and universities applying
for graduates work was also a not
able feature of tho early registra
tion. Every county in Utah is already
well represented nt tho collego. A
surprisingly largo number aro coming
from remoto towns and communities.
Tho small town of Blandlng, ono hun
dred and fifty miles from tho near
est railroad, bent a dozen odd, while

gation with him from Monroo. Tho
various western states havo added
materially to tho registration. Cali

Mr. Madscn shows tho Inconsisten
cy of Simon Bamberger with regard
to the issue of protection tho ono la

refused to run on tho Democratic
ticket' two years ago for tho nomin
ation of U. S. Senator as ho said
ho could not voto with tho Demo
crats on tho policy of free trado as
ho regarded 'It essential that sugar
should have protection In order that
this county might compete with tho
foreign grown sugar. Now Mr. Bam
berger is on tho Democratic ticket,

tion of Common Ground, a thrilling

and spiritual awakening through lovo
of a child of tho slums, employed In
an artificial flower factory.
How she meets, falls In love with
and eventually saves from ruin, at
tho hands of political grafters, a
joung judgo ,1s tho basis of this
most unusual play. Tho methods of
tho army of paraBltes connected with
tho city institution and their dcnllng
with tho unfortunates of tho under
world, nro vividly exposed.
How thero grafters, to further their
own ends, manufacture fnlao condi
tions to harm their enemies, Is

unusual scenes,

ed Miss Doro with a cast of unusual
excellence consisting of such dis
