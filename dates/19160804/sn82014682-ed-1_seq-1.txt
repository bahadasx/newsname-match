TRUSTEE TO BE
To Attend Meeting of Bishop
Estate Board Today; Request
,H;is Likely to Be; Denied
At 3 ' o'Vlocit Ithls afternoon Charles
EL King attend a meeting of the
trustees of the Olshop Estate and re
quest recognition as a trustee. If rec
ognition is refused him, he will leave
the meeting, r That he will be refused
recognition was Intimated today by
A. F.'Judd. "There Is no other course
to follow," said that trustee.
The fact that the trustees of the
Bishop Estate have appealed tempor
arily sets aside, according to law, the
provisions of Circuit Judge Ashford's
final decree 'appointing King a trus
tee. The operation of the decree is
suspended and King is not legally a
trustee, according to attorneys in the
case. -t
"If King Is not recognized at the
-for the present," says E. C. Peters,
meeting today no action, will be taken
attorney for King and the Kamehame
ha Alumni Association, which recom
mended King's appointment
. Attorney Peters says he takes It
for granted that the remaining trus-
tees yesterday refused to sign the
Joint bond of $100,000 with King. The
bond was sent to the trustees by Pet
ers with the request that action be
taken before 3 o'clock. Peters says
that he has not yet heard from the
trustees. Shortly after 3 o'clock Judge
C. W. Ash ford accepted King's indi
vidual bond for $20,000. with the Am
sterdam Casualty Company as surety.
' Attorney Clarence n. Olson of the
law firm of Holmes & Olson, counsel
for the Bishop "Estate, says that the
remaining trustees contend that King
is not a trustee.;butthat William Wil
liamson, is a; trustee by virtue of the
appointment made by - a majority of
the justices of the supreme court.
The next step In . the case probably
will be argument on-the appeal before
the supreme court- :- '
