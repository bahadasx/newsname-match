BUILDS ROADS
Southern Counties Secure
Large Sums From State
Highway Commission for
Road Improvements.
In order to show how the coun
ties in southern Idaho are taking
advantage of the opportunity af
forded them to secure aid from
the state highway commission in
the building of roads the follow
ing report of the commission may
be of interest to our readers at
this time:
The annual report of the Idaho
state highway commission which
has just been compiled by Secre
tary of State George R. Barker,
its secretary, with the assistance
of the state highway engineer's
department, shows the financial
condition of the commission and
the work that has been done on
the state highways over the state.
The report is up to June 1, 1916.
Auto licenses collected up to that
date amount to $124,283.07. The
only bond issue shown was for
$200,000. The receipts from the
various counties amount to $345,
891.47, while there was refunded
on warrants $700.21, making the
total receipts $670,874.74.
The expenditures« of the com
mission total $740,786.10. Of
claims approved by the commis
sion, there remain unpaid a total
of $76,603.43. The balance in the
highway fund is $6,692.08. The
total expenditures for the high
way department amounts to
$16,637.24; for the engineer's
'•office, $20,385.17; field equipment
$3,120.13; preliminary and locat
ing surveys, $35,137.77; construc
tion expenses, $694,399.57. The
last claim does not include $6,323
paid by the state to Twin Falls
county, as one-third the cost of
the Rock Creek bridge. It does
include some construction esti
mates for work done on the state
highways, payment for which
was made directly to the con
tractors by the counties. It is
estimated the expenditures for
the department from June 1,
1916, to December 31, 1916, will
amount to $39,200.

Contract Let For Flour Mill
The contract for the new flour
mill building and elevator to be
erected for the Cottonwood Mill
ing & Elevator company was
awarded this week to the Burrell
Engineering company of Chicago,
which has the contracts for
erecting several elevators at
different points on Camas and
Nezperce prairies this summer
for the various farmers union
locals, and Manager John Meyer
left last night for Walla Walla to
paâs upon the plans and enable
the company to get into actual
operation at the earliest possible
date.
The contract calls for the com
pletion of the mill building with
in thirty days and material is
now being delivered on the site
for the construction of the con
crete foundation for the build
ings. The elevator will be 85
feet in height, over all, and will
be of 50,000 bushels capacity,
while the mill will have a daily
capacity of from 100 to 125 bar
rels of flour. The new machin*
ery needed to bring the mill up
to its increased capacity and
make of it one of the best mills
in the Inland Empire, has been
ordered and will be received in
time to install as soon as the
building is ready to receive it.
The elevator will be construct
ed so that any bin can be emptied
from the lower floor and will be
strickly modern in every respect.
The buildings are to be con
structed of first class material
and when finished will be a credit
to the town and community.
Conditions around the mill will
be as sanitary as it is possible
for same to be made and nothing
but the milling and elevator
business will be carried on at that
location, the hog yards and re
ceiving and shipping stations
being kept entirely separate from
the mill property.
Delivery of lumber for the two
buildings will commence as soon
as Mr. Meyer returns from
Walla Walla, all of the material
going into the buildings having
been secured from the local mills
and lumber yards.
Dr. Moore passed through town
Wednesday enroute by auto to
Sandpoint where he intends lo
cating.
The shipment of five cars of
hogs and three of cattle from
this place Tuesday represented a
total valuation of nearly $14,000
turned loose in this community
in a single week. This is sub
stantial evidence that the grow
ing of livestock pays, and pays
well.
Jay Rhoades and C. J. Hall
were in the city Wednesday from
the upper Salmon river country,
having returned this far from a
trip by auto to Lewiston. Mr.
Rhoades has filed his nomination
for the office of county com
missioner from the third district
on the democratic ticket and will
make a strong race for the nom
ination in the primary election.
He is well known throughout the
river country and will prove a

STILL TALK
BIG BOND
Quite a number of delegates
from the various parts of the
county attended the big good
röads meeting at Grangeviile
Wednesday and, although the
meeting was not as largely at :
tended nor as enthusiastic as the
one held at this place two weeks
before, much good work was ac
complished. Talks of a general
charater were in order until noon
when the delegates were invited
to luncheon at the Imperial hotel
as guests of the Grangeviile com
mercial club.
In the afternoon the districts
that were prepared handed in
to the secretary reports covering
the roads needed, with the esti
mated cost thereof, in their dis
tricts and these were discussed
at some length. The Clearwater
river sections were best prepared
in this respect and some seven
highway districts in that part of
the county combined their desires
in a single application for road
improvements covering a sum to
tal of approximately $193,000.
This called for the construction
of a belt road from the present
state highway near Grangeviile
to Harpster, thence down the
river past Stites and Kooskia to
Kamiah, and, in case Lewis
county should not provide a con
nection with the state highway,
the belt road to be continued up
Lawyer's canyon to a connection
with the state road at the near
est point. This belt road was es
timated at 31 miles and to' cost
$93,000. A further sum of- $100,
000 was asked to build and im
prove lateral roads leading into
the belt road from points east of
the river and from the Winona
and Fort Misery highway dis
tricts.
Other districts were not so
well prepared to outline their re
quirements and in several cases
these figures could not be def
initely determined Dntil the per
manent location of the state
highway across the county is es
tablished. This finally resulted
in all propositions being with
drawn and the executive com
mittee decided to hold another
general meeting at a later date
when the details of county road
improvements could be presented
in a more comprehensive form.
In the meantime an effort will be
made to secure definite informa
tion as to the exact location of
the state road north from
Whitebird, which will materially
simplify the work of several dis
tricts in determining their esti-,
mates.
During the meeting many talks
were made on good roads and
bonding matters and it was gen
erally conceded that a half
million dollar bond would not be
sufficient to take care of all the
necessary road improvements in
the various parts of the county.
Just how the question will be
finally decided is hard to deter
mine, though several solutions
are offered, among them being
the following: Bonding for suffi
cient to construct our part of the
state highway and allowing the
districts to take care of their own
roads in any manner they see fit;
bonding the county for a million
dollars to build the state road and
all other needed roads in the
county; letting the state, with
federal aid, build the state road
And each county be required by
the state to pay its just portion
of the expense as determined by

cient to Solve Road Prob
lems of This Big County

its total tax valuation and popu
lation, without regard to the
mileage of state road passing
through the county.
Parker Files For State Office
Upon the urgeht solicitation of
a number of the leading demo
crats from Boise the nomination
of Ernest L. Parker, of this place,
was filed Monday for the office of
lieutenant governor on the demo
cratic ticket, the nomination
papers being signed and forward
ed to Boise by the editor of this
paper. Mr. Parker was a candi
date for this office two years ago
and ran far ahead of his ticket
but it was a republican year and
Governor Alexander was the
only democrat who weathered
the storm.
Mr. Parker is well and favor
bly known all over the state,
having been a member of the
state legislature for several
terms, and is well fitted for the
office to which he aspires. That
he will carry a heavy vote from
the northern counties where he
is best known goes without say
ing and his friends hope he t will
carry the state by a handsome
majority next November.
Should Boost The Butte
E. M. Ehrhardt and family and
two or three other auto loads of
Lewiston people spent Sunday on
the top of Cottonwood Butte en
joying the cool atmosphere and
one of the finest scenic views
in the entire country. From the
top of the butte can be seen all
of Camas and Nezperce prairies,
the Bitter Root mountains east
to the Montana line, the Seven
Devils to the south, most of east
ern Oregon to the west and well
into thé Palouse country to the
north. Parts of three states can
be seen from this elevation and
even the far famed Columbia
Highway does not produce any
thing finer in the way of scenic
beauty. With a small expense a
good road could be opened to the
top of the butte and, with small
publicity, this could be made an
attractive side trip for tourists
passing through this part of the
state.
I. O. O. F. Picnic
The I. O. O. F.—Rebekah pic
nic will be held Sunday Aug. 6
just beyond Dr. Blake's residence
on the Hussman mill road. Fami
lies are requested to bring along
enough lunch for themselves.

C. W... Thompson %old a
new Willys-Knight car to Dr.
Riggs and an Overland to Al.
Chance, manager of the Madison
Lumber company at Grangeviile.
The Riggs car was delivered
Sunday, Mr. Thompson going to
Spokane after it Thursday and
returning to this place with the
car Saturday evening.
J. E. Gentry delivered four
head of yearling lambs to the lo
cal market this week that tipped
the beam at 670 pounds and
brought six cents a pound. Mr.
Gentry says the lambs were win
tered on alfalfa hay and had no
other feed this spring than grain
pasture. Had they been pushed
at all they could have been made
to weigh 200 pounds apiece. Mr.
Gentry finds that a few head of
sheep are a fine thing on the farm
for they help materially in keep
ing down the foul weed growths
and pick their living in a way
that their feed is hardly noticed.

ance of agate and is so hard that
a hacksaw operated by machin
ery failed to make even a notch
in it, although several attempts
were made. Many beautiful
colors are blended in a section
taken from a portion of the tree
where a hugh knot had been.
The curio is being used at the

The Depth of the Silo
A silo should be not less than
thirty feet deep, because the
greater the depth the heavier the
downward pressure, resulting in
a more efficient expulsion of air
from between the particles of
cut corn or other forage. As
the completeness with which the
air is excluded determines the
keeping quality of the silage,
depth is necessary. Furthur
than this, the greater the down
ward pressure the greater the
amount of silage can be stored in
a cubic foot of space. Equally
important is the fact that silage
capacity gained in depth rather
than diameter makes it possible
for a greater depth of top sur
face to be fed off daily. Silage
exposed to the air for two or
three days begins to mold and
spoil, and for satisfactory results
one and one-fourth to three
inches, according to climatic con
ditions should be fed off the top
each day.
The feeding surface in the silo
should be about five square feet
for every cow in the herd. Thus,
for a herd of thirty cows 150
square feet of feeding surface or
a silo fourteen feet in diameter
will be necessary; for forty cows,
200 square feet, or a diameter of
sixteen feet; and a herd of fifty
cows, 250 square feet, or an id
side diameter of eighteen feet.
Many have made the mistake of
building silos with too large a .
diameter and have experienced
considerable loss by not feeding
a sufficient amount from the top^
each day .to prevent molding.
Better results are gained from
two small silos rather than one
extremely large one, providing
they are properly filled. The
depth necessary for the silo can
be readily obtained. For instance,
if two inches are to be fed off
each day, 180 days feeding would
reqire 360 inches or thirty feet in
depth.
