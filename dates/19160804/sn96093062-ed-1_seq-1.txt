VATIONS IN THfS COUNTY
Mont Wyninn of Form and. Itiutch
Airs Some of Ilia Impressions
of Opportunities and Kc-
sources of County.
Mont Wyman, a writer of no
mean ability and advertising mana
ger of tho Farm and Ranch, of Dal
les, Is spending a few weeks in this
vicinity gathorlng data for write-ups
of tho section for his publication.
Mr. Wyrnan paid tho News offico
a. viBtt thiB wpek and favored this
paper with some of his views regard
ing Bryan county and tho varied In
terests of the farmer citizens.
"Very candidly, tho farmers of
Bryan county do not know tho value
of their own agricultural advantages.
I find in this county some of the host
crops I have found any place in tho
State Particularly can be empha
sized tho peanut crop, which looks
ftno, and which will prove ono of tho
most profitable crops that can be
raised in Southern Oklahoma and
Eastern and Northorn Texas. With
tho co-operation of tho bankB and
tho cotton oil mills, tho peanut prop
aganda will have amplo backing, and
'that means that hogs and dairy cat
tle will prove profitable additions on
any farm."
Mont W,yman, formorly of Durant,
and now advertising manager for tho
Farm and Ranch, at Dallas, Texas,
oxprossed his opinion of the agricul
tural situation in Bryan county in
tho above manner, after spending
aovoral days among thd farmers of
the county and tho merchants of this
city. Continuing, he said:
"Peanuts, hogs and cattle go to
gether. They aro thoroughly allied,
and hogs and dairy cattle aro just as
naturally a part of a peanut propa
ganda as cfoamerioB are a natural
result of dairy ca&le.
"There has been a disposition, on
tho part of the Southern farmer to
nogloct natural grasses'. It has boon
proven that Bermuda; will grow on
our wooded hillsides. ' In East Texas
the pcoplo are very' reluctantly com
ing to this conclusion," and right now
you will find como of tho finest Ber
muad pastures in tho world-on some
of those red Texas hillsides
"I have visited several farms dur
ing the past few days and every one
of thorn has proven beyond a doubt
that Bermuda will grow. Hero fa
solved one of the problems of this
section, that of getting' a real pas
ture. Surely within tho next three
or four years these Bryan County
farms will know more of "Bermuda,
of Sudan, of Crlmspn -Clover, and
half a dozen other grasses that save
tho farmers' feed bill.
"Just a few years ago Texas was
Importing hay and feed stuff -for
"horses and cattle. Today Texas to
feeding Itself and saving; millions of
dollars. Every county should learn
to stand on Its own bottom as far as
its feed crop Is concerned.
"Now, this section has also shown
that It can raise hogs profitably. You
are closo to two good markets, In fact
three, Kansas City, Oklahoma City,
and Fort Worth. This should be one
of the biggest hog-ralslng countifs
1n tho State. This county has splen
did drainage, and hog raising should
be easy. Imagine the difficulty f
some of tho breeders in tho Texas
and Oklahoma waxy black lands
must confront note the increased
chances for cholera and other dis
eases whore less perfect drainage U
enjoyed.
"The f armors In evrv section of
tho United States were compelled to
study their market problems and to
study them closely, because in some
instances tho local merchant was not
konplng posted on current market
quotations, and knew nothing of
market possibilities. Nearly1 every
merchant knows something about
tho cotton market he has beon
watching that for years. However,
i It is tho merchant that knows tho
llvo stock market, who Is able to buy
poultry and eggs, paying tho farmer
as much absolutely as tho market
will stand, who Is familiar with prac-
tically every farm product and Its
possibilities, thnt Is the man that is
of bonefit to tho farmer and to the
community.
"Quito naturally tho farmor" pre
fers to seJl his produco In tho lo'cal
market. If ho produces in quantity
this cannot bo done. Merchants nov
days nUBt co-oporato with tho Tar
mor, else lose touch with hint Tf
you want to keep your Maimers' mon
ey In your home town, help him

"In our offico at Dallas wo firmly

than they did in tho Tuesday pri

tion of 3000 In the. county. Tho
largo vote Is duo partly to unusual
Interest in sevoral -county, races, and

BIG SUBMARINE LEAVES ON THE
RETURN TRIP TO GERMAN V
The German merchant sub., The
Deutchland, which arrived safely in
the Baltimore harbor recently with
a valuable cargo from Germany and
which succeeded in eluding tho vigi
lant Allied vessels on its trip across
the Atlantic, left Tuesday evening on
its return trip to Germany. Tbo cap
tain expresed the utmost confidence
in his ability to elude his enemies a
second time. Howpver, It wilt bo a
difficult matter to accomplish, for
the reason that when tho submarine
approaches the three-mile manttmo
boundary of safety the water Is. pot
deep enough for the submersible to
pink deep enough to go under the
hulls of the many vessels of the Al
lies that are-on the lookout, and will
have to submerge as much as possible
and then go between them. -Tho cap
tain and crew express the' since' ost
gratitude for th fair play they hnve
met with In this country.
.Sjd'.AOO.Ofl FOR NON-PRODUCING

and an official of the Roxanq
Petroleum Company of Tulsa Ini pay
ment for oil leases upon 480 teres of

acres of holdings adjoining the aero

MOE PEACE TALK
Peace talk Is rife in all the war
ring countrlos, according to roports
In the metropolitan nowspapors. Pre
mier Asqutth of Great Britain says
that the entento allies aro waging
war as a unity and can consider
peace only with, tho restoration of
Belgium and Serbia. In Gornmny,
It -is roported that peaco meetings
are being hold In many places, and
the populace Js crying enough of
war. It is not bolloved Germany
would consent to peaco o ntho basis
of giving up hor conquered territory,
and it is on thl spolnt, statesmen
say, that peaco moyomonts will fail.
"CORN BURNING UP

TUESDAY'S WAS
OF MANY
FINNEY FOR COUNTY CLERK HAS LARGEST LEAD, BEING 8lt
VOTES AHEAD OF NEAREST COMPETITOR. NEXT 18 BEATY,
WITH LEAD OF 848, PHILLIPS 807, AND JONES WITH A MA
JOIUTV OF 7tt0. OTHER FIGURES ON RESULT.
Tuesday's Democratic primary
was an election of big majorities,
and honco ono of big surprises. When
unofficial roturnB announced thai
nounced that John Finney for coun
ty clerk had outdistanced Henry
Doaton, his nenrest competitor, by
864 votes, and had piled up a major
ity of 339 votes ovor both of his op
ponents, spectators who swarmed the
streets in front of tho bullotln board
fairly gaBpod, for the county clerk's
race had been regarded as a closo
one.
The race for treasurer between
Carl Boaty and John Spell was re
garded with uncaslnes by both sides,
but tho returns quickly proclaimed
young Benty tho victor, and by the
large majority of 848 votes.
Llkowise ' came as a surprise tho
termination of tho scrap between
John Phillips for re-election as sher
iff and Jeff Early. Many men said
that the race would be .hard and
closo and that It was a toss-up for
a winner. But the returns gave
Phillips a majority of 807 votes.
A dlBtinct surprise was the county
Judgo's race. It was known that
Lewis Paullln, former editor of tho
News, had a big following, but that
he would defeat Itappolee was nev
er for a moment anticipated by tho
old heads and political dopesters.
The unofficial returns give Paulltu
402 votes more than Rappoloe. Elec
tion day morning Paullln told some
friends that ho had tho raco won by
400 votes. Pretty cIobc guosslng!
The county attorney's raco be
tween Chas. Abbott and Claude
Smith waB closer. Unofficial returns
PERSONNEL OF REPRESENTA
"t TIVES IN DOUBT
AV Indicated by unofficial returns
from 2i of tho 42 boxes of the coun
ty, Bryan county's representatives,
in the Legislature will bo Messrs, Wi
A. Durant and Porter Newman: Du

ond. iKbwJpver, persons particularly
Interested In the race for .represen
tative, claiming to avo unoffic'
returns from 38 boxes, claif second
place In -the representative contest
for G. A. Ramsay, of Colbert. It is
evident that ifecond place In this
race will bo fairly close, and the win
til the official returns aro given out
ner may not be definitely known un
by th ecounty election board,
ALL QUESTIONSLOSE IN II RYAN
COUNTY
While no .returns havo been tab
ulated from the county In the sever
al State questions, sufficient Infor
mation has beon received by Secre
tary Benson of tho County Election
board to warant tho statement that
all State questions havo lost in the
county, some of thorn by a heavy
majority. The famous Section 12a
of tho Constitution, which If carried
fn the State will result In the bank,
ruptlng of eighteen school districts
In the county, was on tho ballot
stated negatively. Tho question, as
presented, was tor or against the
amendment, and persons voting NO
thereby voted for tho amendment. It
Is believed that tho majority against
this proposition, and hence for tho
amondmont, has been heavy In this
county.
Were the voters Informed of tho
real meaning of thl slmfamous prop
osition they would undoubtedly have
squenched It here, whore It will da
tho most harm. The trouble Is that
the rank and fi'o o not take the
time and pains to Inform themselvsa
on su h matters, and voto no on
everything that comes up, believing
they are voting against It.
THE NEWS'GIVES THE RETURNS
On another page of this Ueue of
tho News will be found a table giv
ing tho voto each candlduto for coun
ty offico has rocolved in tho various
boxes. The Information was secur

otherwise, and while protty apt to

errors In calculation, It la not offi
cial. Tho official returns, upon
which results are announcod and
certificates of nomination awarded,
aro Issued by the county election
board. As soon as this board, now
In sosslon, has canvassad tho vot&.
tho official returns for each box will
bo given in the News. Attontlon thl3

ty offlcos, as It is there that tho
chief Interest lies. Aa noon as fig

SPEAIRS TAKES THE BIG
MAJORITY
Tho real surprise of tho election,
especially locally, was when Ed
Spoalrs, candidate for re-election as
Commissioner In this' district, polled
more than throe times as "many votes
as did all three of his' opponents
pcmblned. Tho opponents were C.
C. McCarty, J. M. Human and W. E.

commenced to come In It was evi
dent that the 'Others didn't have a

CARTER WON IN A WALK
Unofficla Ireports from ovor this
Congressional district Indicate that
Charlie Carter has been renominat
ed for Congress by an overwhelming
majority, estimated to be about four
to one. In this county, KIdd, of Po
teau, carried one small box, but in
all other puarters was not in the
running In any way.
ELECTION DAY QUIET HERE
Election day was one of the most
quiet that Durant has experienced.
The usual crowds of Interested per
sons swarmed about the polling plac
es, but there was no outward sign of
high fcoling over the election, and
if thoro was any betting going on,
It was kept discreetly under tho cov
er. In former years persons doslr
ous of placing wagers on tholr fav
orites have beon outspoken in tholr
deslcts, but that sort o fthtng was
not seen this year.
COMMISSIONER'S RACE CLOSE
' IN THIRL
Probably the closost raco In th
county was that for county commis
sioner from district three, with three
candidates, Ben Hultsman, asking
re-election, It. B. Lemon of Achllle,
and A. W Lynn of Albany. Unoffi
cial returns given this week by the
News indicate Mr. Lemon's nomina-
tlon over Mr. Hultsman by the small
j majority of nine votes. As roturnB
were received from the various uo
es in this dl.stri.ct. first one and then
the other of these gentlemon wou'ul
forge ahead, the icsult being con
stantly In doubt. The third candi
date wasn't In the running, although
he carried a box or two.
CORPRATION COMMISSIONER
RACE
Figures on tho Stato ticket are;
lacking, as well as on tho Stato ques-
tlous. In the corporation commis-
Bloner's raco, reports seom to Indl- was executed In tho rentonvillo prla
cate that Willmering and Johnston on at London at nine o'clock Thurs-
Jmvo been favored for the long torm
and that Humphreys has it all his
own way for the short term.
OLD FIRE-TRAP IS REMOVED
i
Tho old Harvey building which,
ovor since Durant was a budding vll-
lage, haa "adorned" the lot adjoin-
Ing the News office, has at last re
ceived Its Just desserts and been rel
egated to tho kindling pile. Work
men finished the process of demoli
tion this wcok. It Is reporte dthat a
local capitalist will erect a modern
business houso on the ground.
POST OFFICE APPOINTMENT
EXPECTED
Appointment of a postmaster for
! Durant to succeed C. W. Early,
I commission to consider border proo-
leras, but no definite Indication has
come as to when General Carrania's
reply may bo expected.
. . At... IfAvlMnM A.t....... I, ...Mr.
said that tho reply micht be received
today, although officials would not
disclose upon what information tho
statement was based.
At neither tho State Department
nor tho embassy would any official
predict what position the de facto
authorities would take in regard to
tho American proposal that the com
mission bo authorized to discius oth
er matters than tho military situa
tion on the border. It was made
clear by administration officials tnat
the other arising out of the Iopscs
suffered by Americans In Mexico, on
tho one hand, or damage resulting
from the occupation of Mexican ter
ritory by American troops on the
other,, or tho processes which havo

Congress from that district, although
the race Is so close that the result
