take space in stating.

Within the past six years a full de

been published in almost every paper
in the county and has never been ques

compensation about $700.00 per year,

Reighard for Representative. Millions
of Dollars Saved for Taxpayers
Some Things Done WThy He Is A
Candidate.
A sucessful epresentative in the
legislature must be well versed in in
parhmentary law and legislative proce
dure, a good mixer with his fellow
men, and a student of state affairs.
Continued service developed all three
of these requirements and for that
reason the congressman who has seen
the most service wields the most in
fluence . The same is true in the state
legislature. ,
Record of Achievement.
Why the Republicans . of Fulton,
county should nominate Frank H.
Reighard for representative next
Tuesday is best answered by his rec
ord of service to the people.
He cut from the state pay roll use
less jobs, the annual salaries of which
amounted to more than $200,000.
He put a check on state officials and
employes taking junkets through Can
ada and the United States, at state
expense, as has been , the custom,
thereby saving thousands of dollars.
He made it impossible for the un
scrupulous politician to use the Pub
lic Utilities Commission of this state,
as- has been done, to advance his poli-
FRANK H. REIGHARD
tical ambition at state expenese, cost
ing the state thousands of dollars an
nually.
He gave the state its first specific
appropriation bill, saving millions of
dollars to the taxpayers.
tie introduced and had passed a
joint resolution demanding a probe fo
tne ttate tfanKing Department, which
showed that banks had been closed to
give some politician a job, and which
caused a great financial loss to the
owners of the bank and its depositors;
and that in liquidating these banks
more than S47.000 had been paid out
illegally. Since this probe not a state
or private bank has failed in Ohio.
He reduced the salary of the com
mon pleas judge of this county $400.00
annually, and the salaries of common
pleas judges of other counties in the
same ratio based upon the population
rle never introduced a bill to in
crease taxes. On the other hand he
fought extravagance.
"Among the more important enact
ments attention is called to the fol
lowing: Useless jobs have been abol
ished: extravagant salaries reduced;
specific and limited appropriations of
public revenue made, making impos
sible salary and expense juggling;
lump sum appropriations and the
abuse thereunder are now things of
the past. b rom the Ohio State Re
publican Platform of 1916.
This is the work of Frank H. Reig
hard as he drew every appropriation
bill passed by the last legislature, and
from the time it was introduced until
it was passed, there was not a dollar
of reduction made or a single position
abolished.
He made it possible for the old sol
dier, not only of this county, but of
every county in the state, to have a
county monument.
,With one exception he introduced
every bill that became a law, in the
last legislature that reduced a sal
arv or abolished a position.
He secured a Main Market road for
Fulton County. This means. thousands
of dollars for road improvement that
we would not have received .had he
not secured that road. We have now
received $15,000.00 from that fund
that we would not otherwise have got
ten.
His Value to the State.

Committee he saved the taxpayers of

Gov. Willis.
I have said in daylight and dark
that he saved the taxpayers of Ohio,
$2,000,000. A. P. Sandles, Democra.

Before he voted to spend a dollar he
had to be. shown that the state was

turn. Ohio needs his services in the
legislature. A. V. Donahey, State
Auditor. Democrat.
He is the watch dog of the state
treasury. James Boyle, State Tax
Commissioner and Secretary t Gov.
McKinley.
Why He is a Candidate.
He is a candidate for representative
in response to appeals that came from
everv part of the county that he
should be. He refased until five days
before the time expired for filing
nominatine Papers, and there being
no candidate announced for that office
it was pointed out to him that it was
another expression that he should bo
a candidate. It was under tnese con
ditions that he consented to go be
fore the people again.
He has been unable to make a cam
paign so must trust to every Repub
lican who is interested in economy,
efficient service, and honest govern
ment to go to the polls and support
him.

TO HIS SOLDIER DAD.
The following lines were written "by
Clarence Randall to his father Har
rison Randall on the occasion of the
latters 76th birthday July 17th, 1916.
Both father and son will be remem
bered by many Wauseon people.
"You rallied to the beating drums
When but a boy and young,
With head held high and flashing eye
You marched in Sixty One.
You stood beside your "Bunkie"
uuring oattie, in campt too,
Perhaps he fell beside you
Dying, for the flag in Sixty Two.' "
E'en then the bugle thrilled you
When thru battle smoke you'd see
The dull grey snakey line
Advancing, spitting death in Sixty
Three. '
Then you lay in prison, writhing,
Til your very soul was sore,
But you won and came home smiling
In the Spring of Sixty Four.
That was fifty years ago, Dad
Now there's memories, days gone by,
Now age has thinned your grizzled
locks
And, dimmed your eager eye. ,
But once again you'll hear the bugle,
Answer once again the Roll; -Salute
your Flag, your God, your
Country
Then surrender up our SouL"
