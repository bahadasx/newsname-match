I taneously from the west and from
the southeast French troops yester
K day stormed the village of Fleury 3
; miles north of Verdun and captured
stveral hundred Germans. Ipthe even
ing, howevor, the Germans launched
fjjlurlous counter attacks that after sev
eral violent attempts succeeded In get
fting o toothold In the southern part of
! the villa. Tho French today continue
to hold the northren section of tho
I place and heavy fighting still is fn
progress.
Verdun Is again In the centre of
tho war stage. The recapture by the
j French of tho village of Fleury which
had boon held hy the Germans for more
than a month haB caused great elation
In France.
j It Is the first fruits of the French
slow and methodical offensive begun
-three days ago and seems In the opin
ion of tho French military observers
k^ot mark an epoch nl tho six months
battle for the great fortress on tho
| Mouse.
The Germans appear to be less and
r' Jess capable of oporating on their old
j> overwhelming scale, and tho Initiative,
1 military men think hero, is about to
ktows to the French for good.

The bombers first reached the Bras
I Fleury road. They then separated in
j to two parties, one going to the enst

Last week tho first party stormed a
edoubt west of Thiamount and after
I a stiff fight went boyond that posl
'i tlon. Tho second party reached tho
[little woods 0f Vacherauville. Tho
.whole section from Vacherauville to
| the approaches of Souville thus were
! in the hands of tho French and the
higher commands judged the ttmo
right to attack from all sides at once.
Attacked from the northwest and tho
1 'southeast the Germans in Fleury of

French bayonets finally prevailed Some
Germans managed to escape to tho

COUNTY COUT IS RESTRAINED
FROM SELLING THE ROAD
BONDS.
A temporary Injunction restraining
the Marlon county court from the Is
sue and aale of the Lincoln district
road bonds, was granted today by
Judge Maxwell of Clarksburg. This
Injunction wll hold until the Marlon
county circuit court convenes again
when the matter will be referred to
Judge W. S. Haymond. Nothing more
toward tho building of the $650,000
worth of new roads can be done by
tho county court In the meantime.
The members of tho court this af
ternoon went to Hoult town to view
the location of a new road that has
been asked for by a number of the
citizens from that placo. About a mile
of new road will have to be built from
Hoult toward I'rlcketts creek and Vi
ola, In order to provide an outlet for
tho people of that community. The
former road was mude Impassable
when the Monongahela railroad was
built through that region.
No action was taken by tho court
concerning tho three Yasco children,
this matter again being referred to
Father Michaolski, Polish priest at
Monongah, the local humane society
having refused to da anything at all
In this case. The oldest of the two
little girls is but 7 and the other is
but 8 months of age.

J. Walter Bee has a copy of the Yost
prohibition law which does not agree
with the regular imprints.
Frank Bell and Pearl Hlggins, out
of a capture of IS in the Bee not
are the only ones left in jail, they hav
ing decided to wait until they can
muster courage to stand trial. Tho
others caught are all right now enjoy
ing their freedom after having spent
two and three days in jail.
Frank Demarek, Bill Olein, Frank
Shuman and Mike Opinion were all
discharged, their goods being properly
labelled when they wore ready for
trial. Patsy Butcher who was picked
up on the streets was also dismissed,
nothing being wrong with his pack.
James Ilatton. Frank Batton, John
Carr and John Mraz who is a Clarks
burg policcman, figured that It would
b0 best to try their cases before the
Grand jury and give bond for their
appearances before that body. Carrie
Morganfl Jess Blalock and Alf Mur
ray, all colored, figured they had their
goods properly labelled and asked for
trial before the Grand Jury; waiving
preliminary hearing. Their request
was granted.
It Is understood that Bee's policy
is to arrest a man who has a suit case
full of whiskey on the ground that
a suit case full is too much for one
man's personal uso. it was on this
ground that ho picked up his 18 men
within the past few days. Marion
county justices, feeling that tho law
was made at Charleston, have been
dismissing such cases.
