SHOW AT CONVENTION HALL
LAST NIGHT WAS REVELATION
TO ALL PRESENT. ARTISTIC
AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS.
The Follies Kabaret of the Knights
of Pythias, which was given last
night at convention hall under the di
rection of Harry C. Rennalle was
from every standpoint a splendid
success.
From the moment the curtain rang
up till the grand finale, there was not
a dull moment and a well satisfied
audience which nearly filled the hall
was outspoken in Its praise for both
director and cast.
It would be almost unfair to single
out any special features, as without
a single exception every member was
meritoriously encored. If any spec
ial mention Is made it must fall on
Howard McNees, who made a real
professional hit with his "Blues."
Marie West who with Mr. Rennalle in
la dancing feature, was excellent, and
Eula May Roberts with a specialty
act.
The flack face artist were also
"par excellence" while the choruses
; comprise a petting to the entire
; feature which gave the whole show
I the air of a professional rather than
an amateur cast.
Clem Cooper, chancellor comman
jder of the lodge erpresses gratitude
'to the cast and to those who attend
led."" The affair was a financial success.
