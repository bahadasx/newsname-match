CALDWELL HAS FAILED
TO RESPOND TO THE
CALL FOR HELP
Responses to the appeal for sub
scriptions to the fund being raised for
the dependents of members of Com
pany G., Second Idaho Infantry are
coming in slowly and the committee
in charge of the fund is sorely disap
pointed over the apparent indiffer
ence of residents of this section to
ward the plan. Since the publication
of the names last week but four new
pledges have been received.
That the people in general do not
appreciate the importance of the fund
is the opinion of a prominent busi
ness man. "The people of Caldwell
and vicinity should respond liberally
to the appeal made for funds lo assist
dependents of members of Company
G., who are now serving their coun
try on the border, and it now
is a distinct disappointment to me that
Caldwell, the most prosperous city in
the state should thus respond so
slowly. As I understand it the total
amount pledged is less than $30 per
month and that it will be necessary
to have at least $150 pledged monthly
in order that the committee may prop
erly care fo r demands made upon it.
The personnel of the committee as
sures that the fund will be expended
advantageously, and i{. is indeed ask
ing but little of those of us who re
mained at home to contribute our mite
towards this worthy cause."
The complete list of subscribers to
the fund follows: E. M. Hendon,
Howard & Lemaster, W. E. Wright;
Thomas Tarr, L. A. Harmon, F. M.

BLACK CANYON TO GET
NO APPROPRIATION
THIS SESSION
The senate passed Tuesday Repre
sentative Smith's bill previously pas
sed by the house, providing for the
creation of lien on unpatented home
steads and desert lands entries with
in irrigation districts organized under
state laws, and also on government
lands in such districts which later arc
entered under land laws.
The conference committee on the
agricultural bill struck out Senator
Borah's amendment appropriating
$10,000 for the examination of the
Black Canyon irrigation project. The
house refused to accept the senate's
amendment, saying that such money
should come out of the reclamation
fund and not out of the treasury.
TAYLOR CONFIDENT OF
CARRYING NORTH IDAHO
His Nominaion Means 5000 Democra
tic Votes for Republican Ticket
Lieutenant Governor Herman H.
Taylor of Sandpoint was in the city
Wednesday for a few hours. Mr.
Taylor is miking a trip over southern
Idaho in his automobile in the inter
ests of his candidacy for the Re
publican nomination for governor.
Lieutenant Governor Taylor states
that he will carry north Idaho for the
nomination by a handsome majority.

means that 5000 Democratic voters in
north Idaho will vote the Republican
tickct at the general election.

that he will get his share of the votes

FARMERS OF FRANKLIN AND
VICINITY OPPOSE DISTRICT
Farmers of the Franklin and Mar
ble districts met with members of the
Commercial club Friday night and pro
tested against being included within
the proposed Caldwell Highway dis
trict. That the objcctors had received
an erroneous impression regarding the
organization of the district was ap
parent from the remarks of the coun
try speakers, who were under the im
pression that under the Highway dis
trict a large proportion of the money
raised for road work would be ex
pended on city roads. It was explain
ed by Caldwell speakers that all but
25 per cent of the road tax paid by
Caldwell would be turned back, the
balance, with the exception of 5 per
cent would have to be spent on the
country roads within the district. The
meeting bore fruit in a beter under
standing between business menj^
standing between Caldwell business
men and visitors.
It is understood that farmers living
south of Caldwell are anxious that a
Highway district be formed including
all of the territory in the corporate
limits of Caldwell and extending south
to Snake river. A series of meetings
will be held by the farmers and defi
nite boundaries decided upon. It is
declared by the farmers who are pro
moting the move that by the orga
nization of the district the road tax
of Caldwell amounting to several
thousand dollars will be spent in the
country districts to the south, in
stead of in different sections of the
country as is done at the present time.
Tuesday evening, Wm. Wright was
kicked lix a horse, which crushed
the fingers of his right hand. Ihe
accident occurred at the home. The
wound was dressed and he hopes to

FOR STATE SENATOR
BY J. JESTER
J. B. Gowen, one of the leading citi
zens of Caldwell, and for many years
closely identified with the political,
commercial and civic activities of
Caldwell and Canyon County, was
placed in nomination for state sen
ator yesterday. The papers were filed
by Mr. J. Jester, Junior of this
city and were signed by leading bus
iness men of the town.
Mr. Gowen is one of the n\ôst pub
lic spirited men Caldwell has ever
had. He is a former mayor of the city,
a chief promoter and for many years
the hardest worker in the county and
state fair association; an ex-director
and ex-secretary of the Commercial
club. He has helped in every move
ment that has for its purpose the ad.
vancement of the city and county.
Well Known Man
During the latter part of the ad
ministration of Governor John M.
Haines, Mr. Gowen was state game
warden. Through his activities he has
become known not only in Canyon
and adjoining counties but throughout
the state. His experience in public af
fairs will make him a valuable member
of the state senate.

Breshears pitched hitless ball until
the fatal seventh when two errors and
two hits gave Nampa four runs.
Bunched hits in the eighth and ninth
added three more.
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE
To the Voters of Idaho:
1 hereby announce my candidacy for
the nomination for the office of Sec
retary of State on the Republican
ticket, subject to the will of the elec
tors at the primaries to be held on
Tuesday, September 5th, 1916.
I have been a resident of the state
for over 20 years and, while pny
home is in Nezperce, Lewis county, I
feel that I can serve the people of
the state as a whole, without pre
judice or partiality, and with "equal
rights to all and special privileges
to none."
I have never held an elective of
fice. but have had considerable clerical
experience and believe I am fully com
petent to fill the position for whiqh
I ask your support. _ '
I heartily endorse the Republican
state platform and if elected will do
all in my power to help fulfill its
pledges.
I am in favor of the good roads
movement and hope to see the plan
carried out whereby convict labor can
assist in this work.
I am a firm believer in the State
of Idaho, having my little worldy pos
sessions invested here, and am inter
ested in its progress. I believe one
of the most important ways of bring
ing Idaho into her own is to encour
age the development o"f her resources
and to improve the farms and homes.
1 am persuaded by experience that this
can' be most effectively accomplished
by giving the farmers cheaper money
with which to make these improve
ments and developments, and in order
-to do this 1 would favor the state tak
ing the lead in lowering the rate of
interest and suggest loaning state
money to farmers and school dis
tricts at five per cent; the basis of the
farm loan being made on a certain
per cent of the assessed valuation of
the farm.
1 shall be very grateful for any
support you may see fit to render
in my behalf and promise that I shall
use every endeavor to run the office
as economically as possible—as I
would were it my own business.
Respectfully submitted,
Chancey Wallace.
