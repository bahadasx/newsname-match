Acute;Break
Is Probable

the leaders of the four great brother
hoods of railway employes represent

representatives of the employes meet
again next week after counting of the
strike vote ha.? been completed.

CONFAB BODY
IS NAMED IN
MEXICO NOTE
Reply to Last Americai
Paper Received Gives
Commission Personnel.
EXPECT EARLY START
Belief Expressed That De
parture of Envoys Will
Not Be Long Delayed.
Washington, Ang. . General
Carranza's reply to the last Amer
ican note accepting his suggestion
for a joint commission to adjust
border differences, but proposing
a broader scope for the commis
sion's work was delivered to the
state department today by F.lizeo
Arredondo, the Mexican ambassa
dor designate. It announces the
appointment of three Mexican com
missioners with instructions to,
devote their attention preferably
to the solution of the points men
tioned in the previous note."
Thus the de facto government, ap
parently rejects the proposal that the
commission consider other questions
than the military situation and limits
its discussions to the subjects orig
inally suggested by Carranza with
drawal of American troops from Mex
ico; formulation of a protocol to cover
future operations against bandits and
invesigation of interests which may
have promoted border raids.
The note was in Spanish. Acting
Secretary Polk declined to discuss it
until an official translation ould be
iUMtlc
If it is accepted the next step will be
negotiations between Mr. Polk and Mr.
Arredondo to fix the time and place
for meetings of the commissioners.
President Wilson already has under
consideration a score of names sug
gested for the American membership.
Expect F:arly Settlement.
Hope for an early solution of pend
ing difficulties was confidently ex
pressed by Mr. Arredondo after leav
ing the department. He said he ex
pected to reach an agreernnt with Mr.
Polk by tomorrow as to the date and
meeting place and that he would wire
the Mexican commissioners what the
expectation that they would be in at
least 10 days. He said Asbury Park, N.
J., or Old Point Comfort, Va., probably
would be selected.
Will Start Soon.
Mexico City, Aug. 4. The departure
from Mexico City for the United States
of Luis Cabrera and Alberto Pani, who
with Ygnacio Bonillas have been se
lected to reach a settlement with the
United States commissioners of the
questions at issue between the two
countries will not be long delayed ac
cording to the general belief here.
It is possible that the commissioners
may travel north on one of the vessels
of the Mexican navy, the Bravo or the
Zaragoza, which are now at Vera Cruz,
if it appears that their departure
would be delayed by the infrequent
sailing of merchant vessels.
Text of 'ote.
The test follows:
"Mr. Secretary: In due reply to the
courteous note of the department of
state dated July 28, 1S16, I have the
honor to say to your excellency that
the first chief of the constitutionalist
army in charge of the executive power
of the Mexican republic congratulates
himself upon the laudable efforts of
the American government to arrive
at a solution of existing difficulties be
tween the two countries, and to that
effect, considering it of the greatest
importance that a prompt decision be
reached on the points which have
caused the exising differences between
the United States and Mexico, referred
to in the note of the Mexican govern
ment dated July 4, last, has seen fit to
appoint at once a commission of three
persons constituted by Licenciate Luis
Cabrera, Engineer Ignacio Bonillas
and Engineer Alberto J. Pani, to whom
instructions have been given to devote
their attention preferably to the reso
lution of the points mentioned in the
previous note of this department.
"Licenciate Eliseo Arredondo has
been authorized to 'treat with the de
partment of state the matter of details
relating to the place and date in which
the commissioners of the Mexican gov
ernment should meet the commission
ers of the government of the United
States in order to commence their la
bors. "1 reiterate to your excellency the
assurance of my highest consideration.
"'. AGUILAR,
"Secretary of Foreign Relations."

BLACK LIST WILL
NOT BE ENFORCED
Great. Britain Gives Evidence of Intent
to Alleviate "oxions Features
of Embargo.
(By John Callan CLaughlin in Chi
cago Tribune.)
Washington, Aug. 4. Great Britain
has given evidence to the state depart
ment of her purpose not to enforce Ui
"black list" against the United States.
An answer to the recent protest
presented to the London government
by direction of the president is being
drafted, and, while it is expected to
uphold the principle back of the Brit
ish action, there will be assurances
that the policy proclaimed will not b3
generally applied and that due consid
eration will be given to American in
terests. Even in the cases of the firms
blacklisted the understanding of the
department is that the rigorous meas
ures ordered against most of them
will not be carried out. Wherever dam
age is caused illegitimately payment
therefor will be made.
Keep Within Limitations.
With Great Britain's purpose to
cripple the trade of her enemies the
United States can have no quarrel,
provided, of course, the action taken
is in accordance with the' reqjire
ments of international law.
British control of the operations of
British subjects is unquestionable.
Only where such control affects Amer
ican interests can this government
properly complain and require redress.
It is within these limitations that the
president directed the recent protest
to be handed to the British govern
ment. The "black list" measure is im
portant in itself, but it is only a fea
ture of the policy of restriction upon
enemy trade which has been applied
by Great Britain. Against this gen
eral policy the United. States will pro
test in no uncertain language.
CONTINUING PROBE
OF MEDICAL CASES
Chicago, Aug. 4. A far reaching in
quiry into medical and surgical prac
titioners of Illinois who may have ob
tained their licenses to practice illeg
ally, was promised today as the result
of disclosures before the Illinois state
board of health anu the action of the
state dental board in procuring war
rants for four alleged professional
"examination takers."
Board of health officials predicted
today that before the inquiry is ended
many medical licenses will be revoked
and that fully 100 persons who fraudu
lently obtained entrance to dental col
leges will be arrested.
It was expected that the four men
for whom warrants were issued at the
instance of Secretary Seifert of the
dental board yesterday will be placed
in custody today. They are all local
men.
Hearing by the state board of health
of the changes against Dr. Amante
Itogetti was continued today. He is
accused of unprofessional conduct in
allegedly assisting another physician
to obtain fraudulently a medical
diploma upon which a license was sub
sequently issued and for which the
victim is alleged to have paid $000.

Berlin, Aug. 4 (rfa London 5 HIS
p. m.) Tine village of Flenry,
north of Ynrdun, was regained by
the Germans this morning, it was
oflicially announced today by the
German army headquarters.
The situation at F'lenry and Its !
Tlcinity, the statement adds, now 1

French attack.
Paris. Ing. t. Attacking sJmnl
taneously from the northwest and
from the southeast French troops
yesterday stormed the Tillage of
Floury, three miles north of Ter
dun, and captured several hun
dred Germans. In the evening,
however, the Germans launched a
furious counter attack and after
several violent attempts succeed
ed In getting a footing In the
southern part of the village. The
French today continue to hold the
northern section of the place and
hoary fighting is in progress.
On the right bank of the river
Meuse, north of Verdun, the battle
continues along tho front of Thia-mont-Pleury.
the Germans attacking;
several times during the night with
great fury, it was announced officially
this afternoon by the French war de
partment. At one period the French
entered Thiamont earthworks, but
withdrew owing to the intensity of
the German bombardment, taking 80
prisoners.
Struggle Is Tiolent.
Around Fleury the struggle was
equally violent. Tho Germans attack- i
eel the village several times and suc
ceeded finally in getting a footing In
the south part of tho village. Tho
FYench still are holding the northern
section and fighting is still going on,
the statement adds.
All attempts made by the Germans
to drive tho French from the station
southeast of Fleury were frustrated.
The French positions at Vacherau
villo also were attacked during tho
night, but the Germans were thrown
back with severe loss.
Verdun Again War Center.
Verdun is again in .he center of the
war stage. The recapture of Fleury
which had been held by the Germans
more than a month has caused great
elation in France. It is the first fruit
of the French slow and methodical of
fensive begun three days ago and
seems, French military observers say,
to mark an epoch 1n the six months'
battle for the great fortress on tho
Meuse.
The Germans appear to be less and
less capable of operating on their old
overwhelming scale and the initia
tive, military men here think, is about
to pass to the French for good.
It is 20 days since the Germans made
their last big attack on the right bank
o fthe Meuse, by which they obtained
small results at heavy cost On the
left bank of the Meuse nothing beyond
local actions have been attempted by
the invaders for a week.
