friends, received a stock of "personal
use" shortly after the Supreme court
rendered its decision. On being
notified of the shipment he presented
himself at the freight office. The

what he was expecting? With crest
fallen face and very serious coun
tenance Tommy told the clerk his
brother died at San Marcial, New
Mexico and his friends had shipped
him the body.
MORENO U H ON
TO PRESIDENT
MORENCI, Arizona, July 29. The
Morenci Mine, Mill & Smeltermen's
Union No. 2, A. S. of L. has imf
ed -resolutions and sent a, letter to
President Wilson at Washington as
follows :
"Dear Mr. President:
"We have read your address to the
Press Club of New York city and, we
wish to thank you for the attitude
you have taken and, the sentiments
you have expressed. These are sen
timents that few statesmen, and no
politicians have given utterance to.
"This union, composed of twenty
five hundred men, wish to register a
protest against war and of invasion
with Mexico for the reason that the
working men will have to do the
fighting and the dying to secure the
investments of the money barons of
the United States in Mexico, which
amounts to four billions of dollars.
We protest against the spilling of
Mood for these financial pirates,
and gold to be pou. into their al
ready overflowing coftb. " .
"We demand that the army of the
United States be stationed on this
side of the boundary line and pro
tect this country from any bandits
that may wish to raid our territory.
"We further demand that a close
Investigation be made of the Colum
bus raid, and if Col. Slocum be found
guilty of neglecting his duty, as some
papers have charged him, that he be
courtmartialed and given the ex
treme penalty for neglecting his duty
and inviting war to this nation.
"If you desire to do the will of the
working men of this nation, avoid
war. If you wish to write your name
upon the hearts of the working men,
the real producers of the wealth of
'.Uis nation, avoid war. It will be a
greater honor to this nation to avoid
war at a sacrifice than to unjustly
invade the foreign country.
"Pledging you our most earnest
support in the fulfillment of this
program, we beg to remain,
"Yours for a better America,
"C. A. CA.SAIEY."
New Man In the Box
W. O. Ashley, the new pitcher, of
the Clifton ball team deserves the
credit for the victory over Morenci
last Sunday. Ashley who took Chas.
Eaton's place as pitcher, is no new
man in the base ball world, having
pitched with the coast league years
ago.
Suffered Paralytic Stroke
The many friends of Mrs. John L.
Donnelly, wife of the labor leader In
this district, will be glad to learn that
she is recovering from her second at
tack of paralysis. The first attack
occurring about four years ago as she
was cooking dinner, the second about
two weeks go.
FOOTPRINTS ON THE SANDS OF
RAZING OLD
LANDMARK
One of the oldest landmarks in the
district has this week been razed
to the ground and a building that has
played an important part in the early
history of Clifton has disappeared.
The building has for many years been
the home of the A. C. drug depart
ment and upon the completion of the
new drug store the usefulness of the
old ouilding came to an end and upon
its removal it is understood that tue
A. C. company will park the present
site which will make a vast improve
ment in the landscape in this vicinity.
Stephens & Schade, proprietors of
the S. & S. Bottling Works, have
purchased the old building and a
force of men have been at work this
week tearing it down and there now
remains nothing but the vacant lot
to remind the old timers of the former
structure, which was considered in
its time one of the most imposing
buildings in Clifton. It is understood
that Messrs. Stephens and Schade
will take most of the old lumber to
their ranch near York where it will
be used by them.
The old building has had a varied
history from the time of its construc
tion in 1894, having for the past 22
years served its purpose well. It
had the honor of being the first
public school building in Clifton and
it was here that the seeds of learn
ing were implanted in the minds of
the younger generation of that time.
In the course of time the building be
came too small for this purpose and
a new wing was added, and this was
later followed by another in order to
accommodate the increasing needs of
the school. During this time it also
served as a place of worship, there
being no church edifice in Clifton,
and on Sundays the residents gather
ed here to worship, and the structure
afforded not only moral and educa
tional uplift but guarded the spiritual
welfare of the community as well.
In 1902 the drug department, which
occupied the front of the A. C. store
was moved into the building which
has been its home until the present
time. The passing of the
old building will revive memories in
the minds of old timers in Clifton and
early events in the march of progress
will be lived over, the old being con
trasted with the new, and specula
tions as to what the future holds in
store in the line of architectural de
velopment. 4

Frank E. Curley, who is out for
attorney general of the state on the
democratic ticket, was in Clifton a

terests of his candidacy. Mr. Curley

deavor to meet as many of the voters
as possible.

Stephens, more familiarly known as

his industry and thrift has built up.
a lucrative business in Clifton. He
considers that a man who can make a

DOINOS
SERIOUSLY INJURED
IN FALL FROM
.WINDOW
1
Mrs. Harry Neilds, While Suffering
from Dementia, Falls from Win
dow of Sleeping Room and Escapes
Sudden Death.
I
A sad accident and one which is
! expected to terminate fatally 1 00-
.curred at the Brutinel apartments
;on Tuesday night at about eleven o -i
clock when Mrs. Harry -Neilds fell
from her sleeping room on the sec
ond floor of the building to the ground
below, receiving numerous bruises
and contusions about the body.
Mrs. Neilds had been in ill health
for several months and was rapidly
declining at the last. Her husband
had been caring for her for a couple
of days and was watching by her bed
side Tuesday evening when she asked
for a drink of water and while Mr.
Neilds was absent in another room
she either fell or threw herself out
of the window in her delirium- to the
ground about 25 feet below. Upon en
tering the room Mr. Neilds at once
noted her absence and intuitively
guessed what had happened. 'He
hurried to the ground and found his
wife writhing in agony from the
results of the fall, and after carrying
her up stairs and laying her on the
bed he immediately summond Dr.
Jones of the A. C. medical staff.
Upor "examination Dr. Jones found
that there were no bones broken
but from the . .. frequent complaints
from the patient to the effect that her
chest and back were giving severe
pain it is thought that she had suf
fered internal injuries.
Mrs. Neilds was at once removed
to- the A. C. hospital where every
thing possible was done to relieve her
suffering and it is thought that her
death is but a matter of a few days
at least.
Mr. and Mrs. Neilds have lived in
Clifton but a short time, coming here
three months ago from Bisbee where
he was formerly employed ... Ht is at
the present time employed at the A.
C. smelter, and by his quiet and unassuming-manner
has' gained ...... the
friendship of all who sincerely sym
pathize with him in his houf of trouble
He has been a tender and patient hus
band in ministering to the wants of
his invalid wife and all who know him
are extending their help.
Owing to Mrs . Neild's mental con-1
dition it will probably never be known
whether the accident of Tuesday night
was premeditated or whether she
was unaccountable for the rash act.
The latter theory would seem to hold
good from the fact that she had laid
in a stupor for two or three days and
after the accident no noticeable
change could be discerned in her
mental condition. Whatever the
cause the husband has the heartfelt
commiseration of the community in
his sorrow.
Returns from Extended Trip
Peter Riley returned to Clifton on
Thursday evening after a month's va
cation in the east. He took in the
big Elks' convention in Baltimore and
spent some time in New York
City and other eastern cities, and
returned home by the way of Wis
consin, his old home and where he
spent several days with friends.
Pete says this was one of the most
enjoyable vacations he has had - in
years, and although he encountered
exceptionally hot weather in Chicago
with the thermometer standing at the
100 mark, the weather generally was
pleasant. Some of his more inti
mate friends are circulating the re-
Iport that while in New York City he
was induced by a smooth gentleman
to buy an interest in the Waldorf
Astoria. Pete denies the allegation
and personally we are of the opinion
that he is too smooth an article him
self to fall for anything of that kind,
and that if there was any buncoing
done the winnings were on Pete's
side. As a single handed talker
Pete could convince the slickest con
man alive that he was a back num
ber. "
Metz Runs Amuck
Karl Schade and R. B. Lewis were
badly bruised and shaken up on
Wednesday morning when the Metz
car driven by the former turned over
in Ward's canyon and hurling the oc
cupants to the ground. The men were
on their way to the former's ranch at
York when the accident took place.
In some manner going up the canyon
Karl seemed to lose control of the
gentle and trusty little car and it
began to buck much like a broncho
and after cavorting around for awhile
it run its nose into the bank and
pitched both men over its head.
After picking themselves up a cursory
examination revealed no broken bones
and outside of a severe shaking up
they were otherwise uninjured. How
ever, Karl says he lost confidence in
the roadster and will never be able to
trust it as before. He says the hur
ricane deck of a bucking bronco is
preferable to the Metz when it gets In
action.
Lamas-Alderete
This morning at eight o'clock Man
uel Lamas and Matilde Alderete
were united In marriage at the Catho
lic church. Shortly after the cere
mony a sumptuous breakfast was
served at the bride's residence. To
night at nlnj thirty a Gran Baile will
be given at the Alahambra theatre In
honor of the nuptials.

Clifton Wins as Usual
Last Sunday's ball game was a repe
tition of the majority of those that
have gone before, the local boys
cleaning up on Morenci with a score
of 5 to 4. The score was close and
the game was interesting, the teams
putting up one of the best exhibitions
this season. Ashley and Cramer
pitched for Clifton while Porri and
Evans were the forces behind the
sphere for Morenci. Ashley played
with his old time ginger and pitched
a fine game throughout. He is one
of the best pitchers in this section
and Clifton will be fortunate to hold
on to him for the rest of the season.
Next Sunday's game will be played
at Clifton when it is hoped that the
local boys will be good enough to let
our neighbors win one more game be
fore the close of the season.
It has not been definitely settled
yet whether there will be a game on
Labor day or not, although from
present indications it looks as though
there would be no place on the pro
gram for the national game.
Following is the result of
Sunday's game:
