Southpaw Twirler Who Is Keeping Red Sox Up in Race.
Babe Ruth's good left arm Is doing its share to keep the crippled Boston
Red Sox, holders of the world championship, from falling to pieces In the
present ling campaign. The Bnbe rang up his third shut-out victory of. the
year when he tnmed Fohl's Cleveland Indians, 5 to 0, the triumph giving him n
record of 8 wins In 11 starts. In the 102 1-3 innings he worked the Boston
sldewheeler allowed (58 hits and 24 runs.
Kuth started with a rush, copping four straight engagements, bowling over
the Athletics twice and Washington and New York each once. Washington

"A fearful storm, a regular typhoon,

situation grew decidedly serious. Tons

all hands to get the boats ready. The

Angeles Said to Have Contributed
Largely to Villa's Successes
Obregon Is a Highmlnded,
Humane, Capable Leader.
San Antonio, Tex. Were the Mexi
can army throughout as capable as
some or its generals the United States
would have no easy task In subduing
its unruly neighbor.
It mnst be remembered that Mexico
has had almost uninterrupted war of
one kind or another for a period long
er tnan the American Civil war.
While conscientious American nrmv
officers have been puzzling over maps
anu worKlnc out nroblems In mllirnrv
strategy and tactics, the Mexican gen
erals have been actually leading large
forces In the field and giving and re
ceiving blows In tho same territory
where they now clash with rinde
Sam's Napoleons. This Is an enor
mous advantage.
in addition, the Mexican mllirnrv
academy at Chapultepec, near Mexico
tity, wnich is similar to our West
Point, has a high ratine amonir Instl-
tutions of this character. In the Mexi
can war of 1846-47 the Chapultepec
cadets pnt up a desperate resistance
to the American Invaders on tho
grounds of their school. They were
only overcome after nearly all had
been killed or wounded.
" 'Bo, while the Mexican forces are
oadlv equipped nnd lack ammunition
ami food supplies, they will In many
cases be as well led as the Americans.
Mexico's two lending masters of war
leaving out the ndoubted genius
Francisco Villa are Alvnro Obregon,
"Pancho's" conqueror anu present min
ster of war, and Felipe Angeles, form
er jBuperlntendeut of Chapultoptc
Obregon has the best record. Of
hint more nnon.
Angeles Is the greatest artillery ex
pert Mexico ever produced. Indeed,
us uumcy is recognizea by Kuroi i-un
military men.
At last reports Angeles was In the
united States, but It Is believed he will
return to Mexico, unless aimrehcnrieri
by American troops and offer his
sword to Carranza.
Supplied the Brains.
Angeles remained with Villa when
the latter broke with Carranza. Ho
contributed largely to many of Villa's
victories. Some critics say most of
Villa's glory should go to Angeles
.hat he was the man behind the soenes
and supplied the brains, while Villa
nsplred the enthusiasm.
He was Villa's minister of war when
Villa had an organized government
and was proposed several times as
irovlslonnl president of Mexico. In
this position he could have counted on
ihe confidence and support of the
United States. But Villa feared An
jeles strength and kept him In a sub
ordinate position.
Then Anceles aunrreled with vnin
over the bloodthirsty and unprincipled
nethods of the northern bandit irener-
nl and left him. He did not go over
.o the constitutionalists, however, hut
sought refuge In the United States.
On March 28 last he expressed the
opinion at El Paso that there would be
war between the United States and
Mexico within 30 days if American
troops remained for that period on
Mexican soli.
"Mexico Is a nowder magazine." said
the veteran general. "A spark will ex
plode It"
If Obregon remains at Mexico City
to direct operations from there. ncti
charge In the field will probably be in
the hands of Francisco Serrono, his
chief of staff. He is another military
man whose worth has been proved In
the series of revolutions and Is re
garded by American officers as a capa
ble leader. He has not figured promi
nently up to the present time.
On the northern border the three
principal leaders are General Rlcaut,

fame spread, and so many came to
join him that he rode home at the
head of an army of 4,000.
He was made colonel in the Sonora:
state militia, and when Felix Diaz
started the military uprising wWeh re
sulted in the death of President Ma
dero nnd the sentlne of Huerta. Obre
gon organized 500 Indians and routed
uie garrison at Nogales, which had;
gone over to Huerta.
Soon after this Governor Carranza:
of Coahulla was declared first chief
of the Constitutionalist army and he
made Obregon general of the army of,
the West, while Vllhi became general'
of the central army.
It was the activities, of Obregon In
the Vicinity of Mexico City which
forced Huerta to flee for his life. Ob
regon then occupied the capital with
his troops.
Then came Villa's break with Car
ranza. Obregon was made Carranza's
chief general, and organized the larg
est army Mexico had yet seen. His
great triumph came at the battle of
Celayn, where Villa wob crashed and
forced to flee.
In this battle Obregon was desper
ately wounded. His right arm wa
amputated a few days later. Hts ro
bust constitution resulted in aulck re
covery, nnd he was soon again direct
ing the operations which reduced Villa
to a flying bandit leader, at the head
of only a handful of cutthroats.
Six feet tall. Immaculately dressed,
smiling and clean-cut, Obregon is a
man well liked by all who come in
contact with him. Mexico's troubles

FOR TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD
Argentine Surgeon Practicing In
France nas entirely new
Method.
Porta T.n Tteviie descrlhes n new
method for transfusion of blood, nn
operation often necessary under condi
tions which do not always allow cer
tain precautions to be taken.
Tho method Is due to Prof. Luis
Airnte nn Argentine surireon. and ruc-
eeaafiil eTneriments have been mndn
before the rector of the Sorbonne, the
dean of the faculty of medicine, and
several professors and doctors.
Blood la taken from the bend of the
elbow of nny subject willing to lend
his aid and collected In a receptacle
which contains n solution of ner:tml
citrate of soda, prepared in the pro
portion of one cram of salt to 100
grams of blood. This mixture prevents
the blood from coagulating without de
stroying its vital properties, and as
the citrate employed Is Inoffensive to
the organism It can be Injected Into
the forearm without danger, thus ob
vlating tin chief drawbacks to the
transfusion as generally nmetinvl
The receptacle for the blood drawn
Is a graduated glass with dloutrt
tubing and has a large enough . t,.
ing to allow the blood to fall tli ectlj
Into It. The end Is pointed to allow
the tube for Injection to collect the
maximum of blood without allowing
air to enter. From three to five urams
of solution are placed In It, being a
sufficient' quantity for 300 gnu as of
blood.
