Railroad Strike Materializes
NEW YORK, Aug. 4. The United Press has gathered
statistics showing that America will face the most serious
food situation in decades if the railroad strike material
izes. Coast cities and towns located on navigable streams
would be least affected. Babies and children would bear
the brunt. There would obviously be great difficulty in
supplying perishable foodstuffs to the thickly populated
centers. The shortage of milk would first be felt. Phila
delphia is prepared to mobilize thirty thousand automo
biles to carry food. New York might exist for weeks on
account of being the clearing point for many cities. Pitts
burgh has supplies of fresh goods to last forty eight hours
and preserved foodstuffs to last ten days. Boston has
enough butter and eggs to last all winter. The meat sup
ply is low. St. Louis and interurban trolleys would pre
vent suffering there. San Francisco has sufficient provis
ions to last a month. Los Angeles boasts unlimited sup
plies of meat, flour and non-perishable products. Kansas
City would be unable to withstand the blockade for
twenty four hours. Denver, St. Paul and Cleveland be
lieve the strike would not affect them for a month. Most
cities would face a coal and gasoline shortage.

Roberts' Rules of Order were in
voked last evening by the supporters
of Miss Sabra L. Nason, county li
brarian, to prevent her dismissal
from office.
Refusing to recognize the meeting
of July 12, at which the resignation
ot Miss Nason had been arked by
motion on or before August 1, as a
legal one, Mrs. Llna H. Sturgls, chair
man of the library board, voted with
tour other members to sustain her
attitude and produced Roberts' Rules
to substantiate her claim that she had
the privilege of voting.
The supporters of the librarian thus
won a temporary victory at least, but
those members seeking her removal
will continue the fight either in the
board or in the courts. The fact that
three new members are to be ap
pointed in the near future may re
sult in the defering of further ac
tion until the new appointments are
made.
One Member Absent.
Ten of the eleven members of the
board were present last evening, in
cluding the two members of the county
court, who have seldom attended.
Mrs. A. J. Owen, secretary, was the
absent one, she being at Seaside for
her vacation. Thus the forces were
divided, five and five, but the opposi
tion to Miss Nason suddenly found
itself on the defensive when the
chairman refused to recognize the
meeting at which the librarian had
practically been dismissed.
Mrs. sturgis at the opening of the
meeting announced that she would
not have the minutes of the meeting
of July 12 read as she did not recog
nize it as legal. Asked by Mrs
James A. Fee to state her grounds
she expressed them as follows: "There
was no legal call, according to the
Iy-law8. for any meeting held on
that date and the purpose specified in
the purported call was not the real
purpose of the meeting and the bus
iness attempted was not specified in
the call."
Adjourned or callbd .'
Mrs. Fee contended that the meet
ing of July 12 was an adjourned
meeting rather than a called meeting
and, therefore, any business that IS:
proper at a regular meeting was
proper there. Mrs. Sturgis refused:
to grant this point, declaring that the
preceding meeting showed that the;
meeting had "adjourned at the call!
of the president." She asserted that!
she had not called the meeting of
July 12 and knew nothing of it until!

More Local Wheat
Sold; Prices Up
Between 125,000 and 150, 0U0 bush
els of club wheat is reported to have
been sold here yesterday to local grain
dealers. Some of this grain la said
to have been contracted ut a price as
high as 97 cents. The market today
Is firm and It would not be surprising
if considerable more of the 1916 crop
would be sold before the day Is over.
It Is believed that selling will bo
brisk If the price keeps nn. M.r

Mrs. Fee and Mr. Phelps challeng
ed the right of the chairman to vote
except In a case of a tie but Mrs.
Sturgls, stating that the by-laws rec
ognize Roberts' Rules of OTder as
governing the proceedings, read from
the rules giving the chairman the
privilege of voting to make a tie.
Thus balked, the antl-Xason fac
tion was for a time at a lose until
Mr. strain suggested an appeal from
the decision of the cnair. Mrs. Fee
made the appeal and the vote was
again five to five. Tho right of Mrs.
Sturgis to vote to sustain her own
decision was contested but again she
read from Roberts' Rules to sustain
her
The official record kept by the
board thus shows that no business
was transpired on July 12 and Miss
Nason therefore Is still acting as li
brarian. However, Mrs. Fee had in
corporated in the minutes last even
ing her contention that the meeting
of July 12 was legal, citing as proof
that Mrs. Sturgls had herself called
for a rising vote at that time upon
the motion relating to the lihrarlan
shlp and had taken part in other bus
iness, thus recognising the meeting.
Mrs Sturgis read Into the minutes
her answer to the effect that she had
refused to put the motion referred to,
but. having failed to hear one mem
ber vote, had. as an Individual mem
ber and not as chairman, asked for
a rising vote.
Action Carefully planned.
The opposition to Miss Nason was
apparently taken by surprise last
evening and is was just as apparent
that her supporters had a carefully
organized plan of action which was
carried out fully. It is reported that
they had met during the afternoon
and, with the aid of legal advice, had
determined their course. Attorney
Roy Raley was present last evening
but was not called upon. Mayor Best
and City Attorney Fee were also
present but neither took any part in
the proceedings.
The anti-N'ason faction had seem
ingly the upper hand when the meet
ing opened for the action for the dis
missal of the librarian had already
been taken and her supporters were
not strong enough to rescind it. How
ever, the refusal of the chairman to
recognize the meeting at which this
action had been taken suddenly re
versed the situation.
However, the opposition to the
present administration stated after
the meeting that they considered mat
ters unchanged by the meeting of last
evening and do not recognize Miss
Nason as librarian. They intimated
that they will carry the matter Into
the courts unless they secure a ma
jority in the immediate future.
Mrs. Owen Could IXMih.
Mrs. owen has it in her power to
decide the controversy, but neither
faction i. quite sure of her attitude. It
is quite likely that she will refuse to
accept the responsibility as she has
but another month to serve. Her
term and those of Mr.. Berkeley and
Mr. strain will expire at the end ' of
this month and their successors are to
b appointed by Mayor Best, subject
to confirmation by the council. The
mayor Is understood to be opposed to
Miss Nason but the attitude of the
council ,s uncertain.
