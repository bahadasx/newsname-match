Tribute to Senator William
Gulf port, Miss., July 29. Mis.
sissippi's senior senator, United
btates Senator, John Sharp Wil
liams, is 62 years old today.
In the Congressional Directory,
Sixty-fourth Congress, issued
January, 1916, will be found a
statement as to his birth, educa
tion and achievements.
The statement is more marked
for the modesty of it than for
the information it contains, and
yet it contains much that is of
interest, especially to the readers
of the Commercial Appeal, many
of whom, perhaps, will be sur
prised to know that "the most
d i s tinguished Mississippian,"
who, today, is recognized as ,."
of the ablest debaters and i ;
most patriots and statesmen oi
America, is a native of Memphis.
Senator Williams' present
term as senator expires in 1917,
but, if he lives Until then, he
will at once enter upon a new
term, as it now is definitely de
termined he will have no opposi
tion for the Democratic nomina
tion to succeed himself,
In that fact alone is estab
lished the highest tribute a self-
respecting, spirited people could
pay to his character and to his
worth as an honest, faithful,
capable public servant; his
worth to his state and to the na
tion in the high official station
he occupies.
Under the circumstances, amid
all the sad vicissitudes of public
life which have been character
istic of Mississippi politics for
the past few years, and in view
of the enemies he has made
among the arabitiou3 office seek
ing men whom the primary vot
ers of this state, swayed by ap
peals to passion and prejudice,
have honored in the last decade,
the absence of any open, organ
ize?, active opposition to Senator
Williams is the most wonderful
thing of all the wonderful things
that have ever happened in the
wonder-croatinp" nohticaj history
oi tne araw
Moreover, the wonder of it all
simply increases and grows upon
us when we stop to consider that
Senator Williams has never low
ered his standard to silence the
clamor or win the plaudits of the
populace.
At no time has he ever spread
a sail or trimmed his ship to
catch the wind and please the
crowd when popular breezes
were blowing, nor has he ever
surrendered his conscience and
judgment or furled sail the bet
ter to ride angry waves, and out
live storms, when the fury of
ignorance and prejudge sought
to drive reason from the helm
while passion blew the gale.
On the contrary, resolute and
courageous in his stalwart virtue
and sturdy patriotism, he has
unvaryingly precepted the
aporthegms.
Public office is a public trust,
and noblesse oblige, and has per
sistently practiced as he
. reached.
And therein lies his strength.

FROM THE PEOPLE
Refreehing Candor
Hon. James A. Cunningham
has withdrawn from the race for
Congress against "Zeke" Candler
in the First District, and in a
card to the voters states that he
retires because he regards his
chances bad.
A few days ago Judge W. H.
Hughes of Raleigh, retired from
the race for Supreme Court Judge
in toe soutnern JLMStricc, saying
that he didn't tmnK ne couia De
elected.
This sort of candor is refreshing
because it is so unusual. It gives
evidence of a new spirit in poli
tics in our state. These two men
quit the contests in which they
were engaged, and in their letters
of '.xplanation they had nothing
unkind or critical to say concern
ing their opponents. It is evi
dent that each was a game fighter,
but not the sort of "game fighter"
who keeps right on even when he
knows that be has no chance.
We need that kind of men in
public life in Mississippi. It is
Iruuch better to be a sensible
quitter than a poor loser. Jack
son News.

Rural Credite Law at La$t
"Sot so good as we should have
liked, but better than we ex
pectcd." This expresses the
view or the National Field, organ
ot tne national Farmers' Union.
as to the new National rural
credits bill; and this opinion is in
line with President Wilson's own
moderate declaration: "I look
forward to the benefits of this
bill not with extravagant expecta
lions but with confident expecta
tion that it will be of very wide
reaching benefit." Bays the
Field:
"The systsm as proposed is not
perfect, but it is a better one than
we had hoped 'or . It. has taken
a great deal 'off tuoughf on the
part of congressmen and others to
give to the public this piece of
legislation, and now we look for
ward eagerly to see it put into
operation. A few months or
years of trial will necessarily
prove the need of adjustments
and changes. The adjustments
can be made by the Federal Farm
Loan Board, which is to have a
great deal of freedom of action,
and fundamental changes will be
made by congress, for once it gets
into action the farmers will de
mand things for it in a way that
cannot be ignored."
These expressions reflect the
sentiment of most agricultural
leaders. Here, for example, is
the view of the Dakota Farmer:
"Carping critics and learned re
viewers may find fault; biased en
thusiasts and earnest exponents
may praise its provisions, but
every criticism of whatever nature
is at this time purely theoretical.
There is no American expeiience
upon which we may absolutely
predict the success or failure of
this rural credits act.
"Here is the point: We have
it. Now let us make it work.
"If we find a weakness in ac
tual practice, let's reinforce that
spot. If we find anything work
able in this federal farm loan act,
we have made as great a stride
forward on the economic side of
agriculture as was made in oper
ative farming by the invention of
that first crude self-binder."
Mr. Editor:
I have a letter frou Col. Pink Cagle
of Louisville inviting- me over to de
liver the address to the old veterans
of Winston eountv on next Wednes
day, the 9th instant, and he in
structs me to invite all of the Noxubee
vettrsns over there. He said he
would see to it that they a splendid
time and will be well taken care of,
and intimated that in spite of the
strict prohibition law, he migur be
able to cure a snake bite if anyone
should be so unfortunate as to get bit
ten.
I hone a lot of our bovs will sro over
and partake of the generous hospitality
offered us by the Winston veterans.
Yours,
Big Bud.
Mr Editor:
In my article about Oren Poindexter
in last week's issue I committed an er
ror in statins' that he took the short
Farmer's Course. He did better than
that. After having taken the B. 3.
decree at the University he went to
the A. & M. and took the M. S. de
gree there. This equips him for aay
position that Prof. Kincannon may see
fit to tender him. Prof. Kincannon is
well acquainted with the young men
and women of Mississippi and grasps
the best of these to fill positions in his
school in Memphis. E. D. Cavbtt.
Mr. Editor:
In behalf of the Confederate Pen
sioners of Noxubee county, I desire to
thank our most efficient aud accommo
dating Chancery C'erk, Mr. John A.
Tyson for his kindness in mailing to
every pensioner on his book, a copy of
their application without request from
any one, bat because ne is ever ready
to do what he can to aid the old
soldiers and their wives. John always
takes acknowledgement for any paper
whatsoever pertaining to a pension for
any veteran without any charge. No
county in the state has a more efficient
or accommodating Chancery Clerk
than Noxubee, and I am glvd that he
is so willing to help our old veterans
who need this aft from the state.
Yours,
Big Bod.
Cunningham Withdraw
If people ate less meat in sum
mer and more fruits and vege
tables there would be less sick
ness. It was an interesting testi
mony which a healthy, rosy-
checked old lady gave at a recent
farmers' institute:
"For thirty years we have
had home grown fruit on the
table at least once every day.
We haye raised nine children
during that time, and they
are all living, most of them
here today, and in all that
time we have called a doctor
but once."
The union of the Congrega
tional, the Methodist and the
Presbyterian churches of Canada,
which has been under discussion
for several years, is at last as

eral Assembly of the Presbyterian
church recently remoyeq the
Booncville, Miss., July 31.
The fololwing self explanatory
card was issued by J. A. Cunning
ham today:
"My withdrawal from the race
for Congress is hereby announced.
am close enough to the end to
see that the chances tor my elec
tion this time are bad considering
the district as a whole. Two
months out of my profession and
away from my family and home
surroundings convinces me that
will not make another race. The
people of my county, Prentiss,
were planning a barbecue for my
friends from all over the district
to be at Booneville, and several
hundred citizens to make a tour
of the district in automobiles for
three days, covering some 400
miles of distance, with a baud,
etc., all at their own suggestion
and expense, as announced by
program published. With my
views of the situation I had
grave doubts as to tne propriety
of keeping from them a full dis
closure of my real feelings in the
premises, advised my committee
accordingly and we in consulta
tion with other friends concluded
this course proper, in view of the
unprecedented efforts and ex
pense in preparation by my
friends, which would cost them
not less than $2,500 or $3,000.
Out of deference to those for or
against the other candidates I re
frain from commenting on newly
developed conditions outside of
my circle of acquaintances so
greatly affecting my chance for
election. I will make a definite
statement after the primary.
Neither of my opponents or their
friends had any knowledge what
ever of my intentions until this
course was fully determined.
With every expression of grati
tude to my friends, who are the
best friends in the world, I am,
James A- Cunningham."

An Excellent Appointment
Anent the appointment of F. P.
Garner as Commissioner of Agri
culture, the Progressive Farmer
nasi the following to say:
The new Commissioner of Agri
culture,. Mr, P. P. Garner, will as
sume charge of the office Septem
ber 15. He was raised on a farm
and has a good general education,
.:tL ; j li. i-i i
iiu wuBiuerauie special agricul
tural training. His experience
(luring recent years as agent or the
cooperative farm demonstration
work for the district of south Mis
sissippi also gives him a knowl
edge of the agricultural condi
tions and needs of the state which
peculiarly fit him for the duties of
his new office.
The Progressive Farmer wishes
to congratulate and thank Gov
ernor Bilbo for giving us this rare
but wholesome example of one
having appointive powers by vir
tue of political office appointing a
man with agricultural knowledge
and training to an agricultural
executive office. The rarity of
the occurrence in this country
makes it none the less refreshing
and commendable. This is one
case where our reeret that Mr.
Blakeslee is to leave the Depart,
ment of Agriculture which he
has built up does not lesson the
warmth of our welcome to the
new occupant of that office.
Lloyd-George and Ireland
Mr. Lloyd George, who is the
pacificator as well as the fighting
man of the British cabinet, has
returned from Ireland with a pro
gram that seems likely to restore
quiet to that troubled island
while the war lasts, and that may
prove to be a final solution of it
perplexing problems. According
to the plaa, an Irish parliament
will be set up at once, to consist
of an appointive Senate and lower
House made up of the Irish repre
sentatives at Westminster, who
e, nevertheless, to retain their
seats in the British Parliament.
From that arrangement the six
most strongly Protestant counties
of Ulster ura to be excepted.
Their local affairs will still be
directed, not from Dublin, but
from London. This slightly
modified system of home rule is
to last until the war is over,
when a great council is to decide
ou a new organization for the em
pire, including the question of an
independent local government for
Ireland.
Bo intense are the feelings of
Orangemen and Nationalists, of
Tory and Iladical, on the Irish
question tbat the settlement will
be in constant danger of being
upset until Parliament has actual
ly transacted it into law.
The fact that Mr. Lloyd George
has succeeded in convincing all
except a very few hidebound
English Tories of the wisdom of
his plan is a proof of his singular
powers of persuasion. Even SirJ
ii ward Larson, tne militant
leader of the Ulstermen, has
agreed to it, aud consented to oc
cupy a seat in the new Irish
Parliament. But we can hot help
tninkiug that the martyrs of the
luckless Sinn Fein revolt had
their part in bringing the embit
tered quarrelers over the future of
Ireland to a sense of the necessity
of compromise and agreement.
This particular settlement would
not have met the approval of the
rebels, but the tact that they
were ready to lay dowu their
lives for a definite and, as they
believed, just way oi escape fro.o.
the faltering uncertainty of the
relations between Ireland and
England stung Loth nations into
a realization hat at last talk
must stop and action take its
place.
The news that Mr. Lloyd
George on c rnpleting his work in
Ireland is to lake Lord Kitchen
er's placj as Secretary for War
makes it clearer tbau ever that he
is the ili 014 est man in the
British government. When the
war began he was the unques
tioned leader of the advanced
Liberals, but no man was less
trusted or more disliked by the
conservative part of the nation.
Within a year his financial policy
won the admiration and confidence
of those who bad always hated,
him. Then as minister of mqni.
tions he organized British indus
try with an efficiency hardly less
remarkable than that of Germany.
His tact and firmness have' con
quered the intractibility of stolid
capitalists and suspicious work
ingmcn. He has, it seems, ear
ried through a settlement In Ire
land, and now he succeeds Kitch
ener iti the most conspicuous and
most important post In the cab
inet. Mr. Lloyd George may
never achieve his ambition to be
premier of the British Empire, but
it will not be strange if posterity
sees in the "little Welsh attorney"
the chief figure of the great war,
as far as Britain is concerned.
