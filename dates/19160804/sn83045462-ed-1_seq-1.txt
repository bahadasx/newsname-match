After pushing to the outskirts >
>f the village of Fleurv, three n
miles north of Verdun, Wednes- f
day night, the French brilliantly fi
attacked the place yesterday and ?
carried it by storm. Last night ^
the crown prince's troops *
launched many furious counter '
attacks and succeeded in retaking ^
the southern section of the vil- ,

to wrest the northern portion of s

The German official communication
of this afternoon, how- |
ever, says that Fleury was regained
by the Germans this morning.
Fighting of terrible character
continues at this point,
where soldiers are battling as .
madmen.

front east from the River Mease
the French have pushed north

found the Thiaumont position
untenable, however, because of
the Uerman bombardment and
were compelled to withdraw
from it.
Germans May Lose Initiative.
Military observers in London and
Paris are inclined to believe the in- j
itiative in the Verdun region soon will j
pass from the Germans for good. j
French bomb throwers for a fort- j
night past in anticipation of the pres- j
ent offensive had been creeping for- ;
ward by the \1gnes ravine, east of .
Froide Terre, with the object of getting ,
near Thiaumont work by working I
around Hill No. 365.
The bombers first reached the Bras- j
Fleury road. They then separated into
two parties, one going to the eastward
toward Thiaumont work and the
second pushing northward toward j
Vacherauville and Pepper Hill.
Time Ripe for Attack.
Last week the first party stormed a j
redoubt west of Thiaumont and after I
' a stiff fight went beyond that position.
The second party reached the little ! tl
wood of Vacherauville. The whole sec- j c<
tion from Vacherauville to the ap- J it
proaches of Souville thus were in the 1 g
nands of the French and the higher I P'
command judged the time ripe to at- j
tack from all sides at once. 1 .
Attacked from the northwest and the . ?
southeast, the Germans in Fleury of- J *s
fered desperate resistance, but the , j>:
French bayonets prevailed. Some Ger- ti
? mans managed to escape to the VauxLe-Chapitre
wood, but a majority was j
taken prisoner. vv
Gain Much in Offensive.
To sum up. the French in their last ! #.i
three days' offensive have regained j
practically all the ground that the ,.i
Germans had taken several weeks to d
conquer. | a
They took all the positions for a o
depth of about a mile from the slopes ! 01
of Souville fort to the approaches of p
Hill No. 320, as well as in tne woods h
east of Vaeherauville. and in the Vignes t?
ravine which borders to the west of t<
Froide Terre hill. The Krern h also in- p
stalled themselves in positions south- j
west, south and southeast of the fa- I o:
mous Thiaumont woods. j a
In the vicinity of Vaux-le-Ohapitre < a<
and Chenois the artillery lighting has ' n
been very spirited. In the Vosges yes- j v*
terday the Germans delivered upon the a
salient at La Chapelotte an attack T
which was, however, dispersed before t?
1 many could reach French lines. A
British Report Gains.
Tne text of the Brfttsh official statement
says. "Last night as the result n
of minor operations to the west of b
Foxieres we gained some ground. In v
j other minor operations north of Ba
entin-Ie-Petit and northwest of Delille
wood we raptured a few prisonrs.
During: the night there was a
onsiderable artillery lire on both sides
it various portions of the British front.
V. raiding: party destroyed an enemy's
nine shaft to the east of Loos. Near
he Ypres-Comines road we exploded a
mall mine in the enemy's lines and ocupied
the crater."
The British official statement issued
t midnight reads.
"North of Bazentin-le-Petit we
ained some ground by a bombing atack.
"During the night the enemy sent
our strong detachments toward DeliHe
wood, which were allowed to aproach
to close range before fire was
pened. All were repulsed with heavy;
!>ss, and at one place fifty of the eneny
were caught in massed formation
y our machine gun fire.
"Our heavy artillery bombarded an
ncmy strong point between Pozieres
nd Thiepval. The garrison, fleeing
cross the open, came under our field
un fire."
Berlin Admits French Gams.
French troops have penetrated the
ierman lines on Monacu farm, in the
egion of the River Somme, and have
aken a trench section to the north of
hat position, says the official statelent
given out by the German army
eadquarters.
In the region north of the fortress of
rerdun, the announcement adds, the
French have recaptured a trench section
rhich they had lost in the Laufee wood.
Fliers Have Busy Times.
The flying: squadrons of the allies
nd Germans have been particularly

'rench official statement says:
"During? the night of August 3-4 one
f our air squadrons dropped eighty

actory. Fifty shells Were thrown by
nother squadron upon railroad staions
and bivouacs of the enemy in the
egion of the Somme."
The British statement in regard to 1
erial activities says: f
"Two enemy aeroplanes were brought '
own in the northern sectio of our line, t
me of which seems to be of a new ^
attern. Three of our machines were t

c
gressive Conference. jj
$
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., August 4.?
fter an all-day session extending well
lto the night, the progressive confernce
accomplished these things:
Denounced as traitorous and
against the instructions of the progressive
national convention the action
of the national committee in indorsing
Charles E. Hughes for the
presidency.
Read out of the party the progre'
sive national committee which took
that action.
Decided against calling a new na.
tional convention, and left all pro- p
gressives to act according to their
individual judgment and conscience p
in the national elections. ' p
Authorized a committee of fifteen lj
to co-operate with the remaining ^
loyal members of the national pro- t
gressive committee in the coming '
campaign. '
Appointed a new treasurer of the
progressive party and demanded an
accounting of the present treasurer.
Repudiated the action of Treasurer (
Strauss of the progressive national ^
committee in soliciting contributions t
in the name of the progressive party
for the support of the Hughes cam- a
pajgn fund. v
Hope for Balance of Power. [
While not so stated In the resolutions, j
main purpose underlying the pro- a
?edings thus taken is a line of action r
1 the campaign which it is hoped will a
lve the progressives the balance of ^
Dwer in the electoral college. r
The scheme in a daring one and its ?.
bjeet. if possible of accomplishment, j \
; to deadlock the electoral college and v
resent to the republicans the alterna- i *
ve of throwing the selection of Presi- I*
cnt into the House of Representatives, j v
hich would be the choice of Wilson, c
r dictating the acceptance by the re- *
ublieans of a President of their own a
hooslng. 1
The campaign committee will go into j
tery close state and appeal to the In- <
ependent sentiment, the first voters 1
nd all persons dissatisfied with the 5

The progressive party will be exloited
.'is the party for the uplift of
umanity, the first sponsor of humanlirian
doctrines which have since been
iken up by the democratic and the reublican
parties.
The proceedings of the three sessions
r the conference were marked by
bsolute harmony. all resolutions
dopted unanimously. The only bitteress
manifested was toward the men

nd "sold out" tbe national party,

LONG, TANGLED SESSION
OF SWAPPING, PROSPECT
Lower Chamber Representatives Enter
Discussion Uninstructed on
Many Important Points.
The District of Columbia appropriation
bill was sent to conference
by the House of Representatives
today shortly after the
measure had been received with
the numerous Senate amendments
which change materially
the character of the original
House bill.
The conferees appointed by the
Speaker for the House are Representatives
Page, McAndrews and Davis.
Representative Page, chairman of the
5uucvmmiti.ee in cnarge or tne Dill in
the House, asked unanimous consent
Lhat the Senate amendments be disigreed
to and that a conference with
:he Senate should be requested. No
fote was taken to show the House atitude
on any of the Senate additions
intl changes. The conferees of the
^ouse will therefore enter into negoiations
with the conferees of the Senite
uninstructed on the half-and-half
principle, the intangible property tax,
he hospital site matter and the other
mportant Senate changes.
Expects $ill to Come Back.
Representative Anderson of Minnesota
tsked Representative Page whether he did
lot believe the House should be given an
jpportunity to vote on the Senate amendnent
taxing intangible personal property.
Ftepresentative Page, in replying, indicat?d
his belief that the bill would be seen
Lgain in the House because the conferees
would be unable to agree and be practi:ally
promised the House an opportunity
:o vote on the intangible property tax.
"Do you not think the bill will be back
lere several time?" asked Representative
Vlann of Illinois.
"I do," said Representative Page with a
tmile.
The conversation points to a long and
'.angled series of conferences between
Senate and House.
Before the House met today a commitee
of bankers composed of Hunter H. McCee,
Robert N. Harper and William T.
Jalliher called on Representative Page to
.sk for a hearing on the intangible proprty
tax amendment. At that time Repesentative
Page believed a separate vote
vould be demanded by the House on the
imendment and he told the bankers he
>elieved the House would instruct him afIrmatively.
Bill Radically Changed.
The members of the subcommittee of
he House who drafted the original
Mstrict bill had to look twice at the
neasure when they learned it had been
ompleted by the Senate. They recog- j
uzeu umy ?. icw papsages in the <locunent.
and the revised Senate total of
13,828,734.72 is so much larger than
he House total as to create a stir in
he House. However, it can be said
hat the appropriations committee
nembers rather expected the Senate to
ncrease the bill, and had the Senate
etained the items for the purchase of
he Dean tract and other parks the
louse conferees would have pursued a
ine of action somewhat different from
hat which will have to be pursued now
n conference. This is true because of
he fact that the more differences there
re between Senate and House bills the
nore cards the conferees have to play
k-ith?the easier the trading and logoiling.
The big and important proviion,
the retention of the half-and-half
Ian, will be played for by the conerees
in a series of compromises and
rades. in which the other items of ap ropriation
and legislation are used.
It is folly to attempt to predict what
he House will do on the half-and-half
trovision. There are members whose
osition on the subject is well known,
>ut it was pointed out today by a mem?er
of the House that there has never
>een a bitter flght-to-the-last-ditch on
he half-and-half in the House. That is,
n previous fights on this vital subject
here always has entered a compromisng
element of some sort.
Tug of War Now Exists.
At the last session, just as a fight to
he finish and a record vote on the
lalf-and-half direct was about to be
aken, the Underwood resolution was
dopted, and a joint select committee
vas appointed to get the facts in the
ase between the District and thei
Jnited States. Now the House has reected
tne findings of the committee, i
nd in the District appropriation bill
ejected the half-and-half principle of
ppropriation flatly. The Senate spurns
he House, and restores the half-andlalf.
Between the two there is a diect
and straightaway tug of war.
It is understood that the House conerees
will not swallow the provision
o tax intangible personal property
without a struggle. What they fear is
eing instructed by the House to accept
he senate amenumeiu "m mm euojeci,
lthough to have such instructions
vould make their task with the Senate ,
onferees easier. It would take away
til chance of argument. They would
imply say. "The House instructs us to
iccept this." One of the appropriaions
committee members said today:
"How do we know whether four mills
s a proper tax rate on intangible personal
property? This is a subject into
which we should go with great care
ind deliberation* and i^t tack it hur-iedly
to an approprianon bill."
Pension Sentiment Divided.
On the firemen and police pension
intendment the House seems to be in
-onfuslon. The District committee of
the House has been struggling with
[he matter all this session and has proiuced
nothing as yet. although a sub:ommittee
to which the bill was inrusted
reports "progress." Some mem>err*>f
the House are opposed to pensioning
firemen and police. Now that
[he Da Foliette amendment has been
placed in the appropriation bill, it appears
that there is a grave difference
>f opinion on the House side as to the
practicability of the amendment.
The first comment on the Da Fol- 1
ette amendment was favorable, but
t gradually dawned on the friends of
he pension movement that he had 1
picked up a House bill introduced by ]
Representative Cary of Wirconsln by ,

Record of Death Toll in New York.
5,COO Other Little Ones Have
Been Stricken.
NEW YORK, August 4.?More than
1,000 children now have been killed by
the epidemic of infantile paralysis and
nearly 5,000 have been stricken by the
disease. The health department's daily
bulletin shows that the plague still
continues to gain headway. During
the twenty-four hours ending at 10
a.m. today forty-five children died of
the disease in the five boroughs of
New York city, and 175 new cases, the
second largest number in a single day,
were reported. Since June 26 there
have been 4,680 cases, 1,025 of which
proved fatal.
A consignment of eighty South and
Central American monkeys arrived
here today on the United Fruit Steamer
Almirante. The animals, according to
their custodian, M. Schmit, are to be
used in experiments by physicians of
the Rockefeller Foundation engaged
in seeking a cure for infantile paralysis.
Fifty thousand dollars was contributed
for this special work recently
by the foundation.
The group of distinguished pathologists
and bacteriologists summoned
here from all over the country to investigate
the infantile paralysis epidemic
in the hope they may discover
a specific for the disease, spent the
early part of today in observing the
work by the health department in
diagnosing the cases and the method
used in quarantining the homes of the
patients.
Will Meet Every Evening-.
They have been organized in two
committees which will hold meetings
every evening while they are here, but
may not make their reports until they
have left the city.
The Staten Island Civic League has
sent to the governor, the mayor and
the health commissioner a letter asserting
that it is the prevalent opinion
of scientists that the germ of infantile
paralysis is carried by flies
feeding upon filth. The committee asserts
that "with near 1,000 babies
stricken and hundreds dead, with a
scourge beyond, control" the city should
immediately reverse its policy of
handling the city garbage so as to
obtain a profit from it and urges that
the garbage should be burned.
City officials say there is little likelihood
of postponing the opening of
the schools in September and that the
children will be as safe in school as
anywhere.
Dr. C. H. Lavinder, who has charge of
the government research squad at
work here, said today that the scope
of this work has been broadened to
include exhaustive investigation of the
disease from three viewpoints:
"Extensive, intensive and in relation
to outside foci," that is, with reference
to its appearance in neighboring states
and communities.
Investigation in Washington.
This work has necessitated the transfer
of all laboratory investigation 'to
the hygienic laboratory of the public
health service in Washington, Dr.
Lavinder said, where the activities of
the investigators are centered upon the
discovery, if possible, of the origin of
the local epidemic, its basic causes and
of reliable treatment.
The suspicion is held by the government
workers, it was learned today,
that the disease may have originated
in Hudson. N. Y. Records of the public
health service are said to show that
many cases of the disease and of the
same character as those found here
were reported from Hudson just prior
to the outbreak of the local epidemic.
Cases Ontside New York City.
ALBANY, N. Y., August 4.?Twentythree
new cases of Infantile paralysis
and two deaths from the disease in the
state outside of New York city were reported
to the state health department today.
This brings the total number of
case* up-to 568 and the total deatha to 53.

Two gunners from the British navy,
vho were in charge of a six-pound gun,
nounted on the afterdeck of the Strathless,

when a ball struck it amidship,
tausing an explosion. He said the unler-water
boat dived suddenly and was

. ball striking her amidships near the
yater line.
"It was the first intimation we had of
he underwater craft. In an instant our
wo gunners had their piece trained on
he submarine and began firing. I orderd
full speed ahead, but .ihe submarine
;ept up with us, firing rapidly.

IMPLIES DISSENT
TOTERMS PROPOSED
Carranza Conditionally Agrees
to Commission for Adjusting
Issues With U. S.
NAMES THREE MEMBERS
TO REPRESENT MEXICO
Reply to the Last American Note
Delivered at the State Department
Today.
Gen. Carranza's reply to the
last American note accepting his
suggestion for a joint commission
to adjust border differences, but
proposing a broader scope for the
commission's work, was delivered
to the State Department today by
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador designate. It announces
the appointment of three
Mexican commissioners with instructions
to "devote their attention
preferably to the resolution
of the points mentioned in the
previous note."
Thus, the de facto government apparently
rejects the proposal that the
commission consider other questions
than the military situation, and limits
its discussions to the subjects originally
suggested by Carranza ? withdrawal of
j American troops from Mexico; formulation
of a protocol to cover future operations
against bandits and investigation
of interests which may have promoted
border raids.
No Indication of U. S. View.
Whether this will be satisfactory to
the United States government has not
been indicated. The note was in Spanish,
and when he went to today's cabinet
meeting Acting Secretary Polk declined
to discuss it until an official
translation could be . made.
If it is accepted, the next step will be
negotiations between Mr. Polk and Mr.
Arredondo to fix the time and place for
meetings of the commissioners. President
Wilson already has under consideration
a score of names suggested for
the American membership.
Hope for an early solution of pending
difficulties was confidently expressed by
Mr. Arredondo after leaving the depart|
ment. He said he expected to reach an
agreement with Mr. Polk by tomorrow
I as to the date and place of meeting, and

to the resolution of the points

Mexican Commissioners on Way.
MEXICO CITY, August 4.?The departure
from Mexico City for the United
States of Luis Cabrera and Alberto
Pani, who with Ygnacio Bonillas have
been selected to reach a settlement with
the United States commissioners of the
questions at issue between the two countries,
will not be long delayed, according
to the general belief here. It is possible
the commissioners may travel north on
one of the vessels of the Mexican navy,
the Bravo or the Zaragoza, which are
now at Vera Cruz, if It appears that their
departure would be delayed by the infreouent
sailing of merchant vessels.
It is expected that when Senor Cabrera,
who is secretary of finance, leaves the
federal capital, control of the finance department
Will be vested In Rafael Nleto,
the subsecretarv.
It is believed that it will be necessary to
fill temporarily the post of subsecretary
for foreign affairs. Juan N. Amador, the
present occupant, is gravely ill and will
be unable to perform the duties of the
offlce for some time.

Tables Resolution to Investigate
Wages and Hours of Service of
Employes?Conference Monday. J
President Wilson, eager to do
all in his power as chief executive
to avert the threatened
strike to tie up all the 1,700 railroads
of the country, had an early
morning conference with Judge
William L. Chambers, commissioner
of the United States board
of mediation and conciliation, the
federal organization empowered
to prevent interference with the
regular traffic of the railroads.
It is understood that the President
also considered this matter
with his cabinet, as soon after
Judge Chambers had left the
White House he was informed
that the President would probably
want to see him again later.
While awaiting his second conference
with the President, Judge
Chambers withheld a statement
which he promised to the news
paper men regarding enorts to
avert the strike.
Judge Chambers Makes Statement.
In answer to inquiries. Judge Chambers
later made the following: statement:
"Yes, I was called to the White House
this morning by the President, who
wished all the information available
on the pending railway labor controversy?in
other words, the President
wished to be in definite touch with the
situation. I am sorry I cannot meet
your request for what took place at
the interview. The President now has
all the information the board possesses
on the subject and he also has our
point of view, but any statement that
may be given out for publication
touching the conference with him must
be made from the White House."
At the White House it was said
there would be no formal statement.
Judge Chambers pointed out that the
"strike vote" now being taken does not
mean immediate strike, but a threat to
strike if negotiations by labor officials
authorized in that vote are unsuccessful.
He also pointed out that the federal
board of mediation and conciliation
has power to act on the invitation of
either party to the railroad controversy,
or in urgent cases without waiting
for such an invitation.
Senate Puts Off Investigation.
Pending mediation and arbitration between
the 2-3 railroad systems and
their 400,000 employes, the Senate committee
on interstate commerce today
tabled a resolution authorizing an investigation
of the wages and hours of
service of railroad employes by the interstate
commerce commission.
G. W. W. Hanger, designated yesterday
by the President as assistant commissioner
of the board of mediation
and conciliation, is on his way to New
York on invitation to the board for an
immediate, conference with certain rail
roads represented by the special conference
committee of railroads and employes
in yard service represented by the Switchmen's
Union of North America. This request
was signed by Horace Baker, chairman
of the special conference committee
of the railways, and S. E. Heberling, international
president of the Switchmen's
Union of North America.
Conference here Monday with the
board of mediation and conciliation in
an effort to adjust differences was arranged
at the joint request of the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad and certain of
its employes engaged as telegraphers.
This request was signed by J. J. Dermody,
fourth vice president of the Order
of Railroad Telegraphers, and J. M.
Davis, vice president of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company.
Commissioner Chambers pointed out
that in both these cases strike votes have
been taken and said that these appeals
show the wide latitude that rests with
the federal board to adjust the threatened
nation-wide strike after the strike vote
is announced Tuesday.
President in Conference
Over Strike Threatening
to Tie Up All Railroads
Judge William L. Chambers, commissioner
of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation, conferred at
the White House today with President
Wilson regarding the threatened strike
on more than 1.700 railroads in 225 systems,
involving more than 400,000 employes.
As this is, in the words of Judge
Chambers, "a unique case, being the first
in which all the railroads have united,"
the matter is being given most serious
consideration by all the agencies of the
federal government. The President has
shown his concern to do all that can be
done to avert a strike and is willing if
necessary to make a personal appeal,
both to the railway systems and the
brotherhoods of employes.
At the White House conference every
phase of the situation was gone over
thoroughly. The Kewlands act. under
which the federal bureau of mediation
and conciliation is given authority, wu
reviewed. Judge Chambers pointing out
to the President just what the provinces
of the board are. Judge Chambers explained
to the President that he believes
there is nothing formal that the federil
government can do just now. but that it
must wait until the result of the strike
vote now being taken is complete^ Mon
