LONDON, Ail),'. 3. Roger emo
llient, former knight and cmi.su!,
Vras hanged at 9 o'clock this morning
In Pi ntonville jail fur high treason,
lie was convicted of conspiring to
cau.-c an armed revolt in Ireland and
with having sought German aid to
that end.
Two hours ixfor,! the execution a
crowd of men and children gathered
before the prison pates. Twenty
minutes helore Casement mounted
tlie scaffold the great prison belJ
Commenced to toll. The t I I wits
greeted with cheers mingled with
Home Brians, At tt o'clock the crowd
had swollen to such proportions that
it extended for two hloos from the
prison front. At, one minute after
nine a single stroke of the hit; hell
announced that tlie trap had heen
sprung, it was the signal lor a mock,
inc. Jeering yell from the crowd,
which suddenly died away into dead
alienee.
Carcnii nt met his death with calm
courage, according to eye-w itnesscs.
Earlier in the morning two priests of
the Roman Citlmllc church adminis
tered the last rites In the cell of the
condemned man and shortly after
ward a little procession headed by the
clergymen with Casement following,
a warder on either side, proceeded to
ward the execution platform only
seven yards away. The priests re
cited the litany of tho dying. Case
ment responding in low tonts: "Lord
have mercy on my soul."
Irypr on His Ilps.
As the party reached Ihc wpot where
tho (Tallows was erocted the special
ercul loner, a hair Jrcsncr named
Ellis, approached resolutely and
t,uick!y pinioned him. The two chap
lains, the under sheriff of london and
under sheriff of Middlesex then took
up their positions In front of the
sri.ffold. Casement mounted the
gallows' steps firmly and commended
his spirit to Ood as he itepped on the
trap. A moment later the lever was
pulled.
Imrrediately the trap was sprung
the priscn engineer and physician de
scended into the pit, wlurn, ufter the
application of the usual tests, Case
ment was pronounced dead at nine
minutes after nlno. Acordinsr to cus
tom in the case of prisoners hanged
for crimes similar to that of Case
ment's, his body wIM he hurled In
quick lime In the prison yard, but
prolnbly no decision as to the burial
will bo made until after the Inquest.
An affecting Incident took place
outside the lirison walls as the exe
cution was In progress. At the hack
of the pHson, a little distance from
the jeering laowii ai")ut the gates was
a group of about thirty Irishmen and
women. When the duM clang of the
prison hell announced that the
doomed man had paid the last penalty
this group fell on their knees and
with bowed heads remained for some
moments silently praying for the re
pose of the soui of their dend follow
countryman.
Immediately after the execution
three notices were posted on the pris
on door. The first, signed by the un
der sheriff of London, the governor
of the prison and Father James Me
Carrel!, ("iisomcnt'ii confessor, read:
Calm to the I ja.it,
"Judgment of death was this day
executed on Roger David Casement in
his majesty's prison of Pentonvllle in
our presence."
A similar notice was signed hy the
under sheriff of Middlesex county,
and the third bore the signature of P.
K. Mander. the prison surgeon, who,
certified that be had examined the
body and found Casement dead.
Kills, the executioner, arrived In the
prison early last evening anil Immedi
ately made hia preparations. Ho ex
amined the trap door In the execution
shed and tested It thoroughly with a
bag exactly the same weight as Case
ment. Bills remained In the prison
all night.
Casement showed not the Brightest
concern over his fate. He ate well
and chatted freely and cheerily with
two warders In hia condemned cell.
After a hearty Hate supper he divested
himself for the last time of his con
vict clothes and went to bed. He was
notified that he would be allowed to
rear hid own civilian clothes for the
execution, though, he woufd not be
permitted to wear a collar.
All the members of Casement's
family were Protestants and he was
brought up In that faith, but he be
came a convert to Roman Catholicism
recently. On June 29 hp was regis
tered as a member of the Roman
Catholic church, and since that time
Father McCarrell and McCarev of
Briengrove church, near the prison,
have been ministering to him. He
received his flrit and only communion
at 7 o'clock this morning when he as
sisted at mnjw In Ills cell. One of his
attendants raid that his overpowering
love for God and Ireland was most
striking. According to this amend
ment the last words of the condemned
min. apart from his prayers, were:
"I die for my country."
Father McOaTcl sold that he found
Casement to bn a beautiful character
and that he ne"er Instructed nny one
In his religion who showd himself

which have accumulated during his
c ntinued absence from the city.
Since his appointment, Mr. Man
gan has not devote! any groat portion
cf his ime to this important duty,
according to some city officials, and
as there is a great deal of wcrk to be
accomplished, especially with refer
ence to inspection of the city's milk
wipply, it is only through his efforts
th:.t a standardized supply of puro
milk can be secured for consump

It In the duty of Mr. Mangan to

Commissioners This Morn

Definite Stand.
IJOMjOWINO close on the heels of
m. several accidents, in which a num
ber of persona were seriously in
jured, and in answer to counties) pro
tests made both In person and
through other channels, I he mayor
and commissioners In a meeting this
morning will devote a major portion
of their time to the consideration of
new jitney regulations, which when
they become laws, will be the most
sir I agent every promulgated In this
state.
Although A. I Funk, commissioner
of police and fire, has issued orders
by the scores to his police officers,
and has Instructed Chief of Police
Lucas to Increase the traffic squad
by at least a dozen men, the reign
of terror for the pedestrians con
tinues. As a last resort the commis
sioner has announced his intention
of securing the enactment of a law
which will place the entire opera
tion of the jitneys within the control
of the police department. He will
begin the regulation of the jitney
business In Tulsa with a let of' laws
which will place the driveri and own
ers .if these cars under, hi depart
ment's control from the llmo thejr
enter the jitney- stations on tho down
town streets until their passengers aro
discharged in a safe manner,
NumlKT of Hiilc.
While no tentative ordinance has
been drawn up In this matter, the phn
of the commissioner, which will be
backed by all the members of the
commission. Including Mayor Sim
mons, wtis announced yesterday after
noon. It provides for a number of
regulations which have heretofore
never been incorporated in such an or
dinance either in Tulsa or any other
city in the state.
Will Increase Licrnpf.
One of the provisions which is ex
pected to drive from the business the
reckless drivers of the jitney automo
biles, Is a high license wale. It has
been proposed to boost this license up
to J 100 in each case and It also Is in
timated that a new scale of fines will
be promulgated through the ordi
nance, ranging In a fine of $50 for
the first offense and expulsion from
business tind forfeiture of license on
second offense.
The commissioners also will be
asked to consider the proposition of
Incorporating into the ordinance a
clause which shall provide for police
officer starters at all Jitney stations;
these officers belrg Instructed to see
that all cars take the proper precau
tions In loading passengers, in leaving
stations, and in operation on adjacent
streets to the station.
Certain Routes,
Another feature which will become
n part of the new ordinance if the
appeals cf a number of citizens are
iriven consideration, will provide that
iill jitney automobiles shall operate
along certain prescribed roules, with
no alternative but to opeYato along
these lines or forfeit the license under
which the car Is operated.
"Every effort Is going to be made
to regulate the jitney traffic in Tulsa,"

Another prevision, and one which

CHILD LAB0Rhm
BILL REACHES
SENATE AT LAST
Measure Was Placed on
Program for Session at
Wilson's Urjjins:.
SOUTHERN LEADERS
OPPOSING MEASURE
Will Prevent Interstate
Commerce of Products
of Minors.
WASHINGTON', Aug. 3. The sen
ate late today began consider
ation of the bill to prevent interstate
commerce in the products of child la
bor. The moaaiire was restored to a
place on the legislative program for
tl itt session at tile reiiest of Presi
dent Wilson after Uk Democratic cau
cus, ni i o hail decided to let it go over
until December. Southern lH-mocrats
arc the only opponents of the meas
ure, which will be kept before the
senate until it is passed.
Senator Robinson in nresenting the
bill on behalf of the commerce com
mittee, told bis southern colleagues
tht re was a strjng sentiment in favor
fit it in their states. He read ex
tracts from new -spa tiers In North and
South Carolina, Alabama, Oeorgui,
Mississippi and Texas favoring child
labor legislation.
Power to Kcgiilalo Complete.
Answering contention that the pro
posed act would effect an unconstitu
tional tianHgression of the rights of
the states, tho Arkansas senator de
clared that under decision of the su
preme court the power of congress to
regulate commerce is comixeto and
absolute except as limited by the con
stitution itself; that the only limita
tion Is the fifth amendment, which
provides that no person shall be de
prived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law: that the
fourteenth amendment to the consti
tution imposes tho same limitation on
the states as that Imposed by tho
fifth amendment on the federal gov
ernment; and that "if the states in
the exercise of the police power can
suppress evils of child labor, con
gress through Its power to regulate
commerce can promote the same end
by denying the channels of commerce
to persons and enterprises In the in
terest of tho public health, morals
nnd safety."
Senator Robinson asserted congress
could do Indirectly a great many
things that it could not directly per
form. "The lottery cases and the white
slave cases decided by the supreme
court," he said, "affirm the power of
congress to enact legislation In the
nature of police regulations through
its power to regulate commerce; that
congress has as much power to sup
press; recognized evils In the condi
tions surrounding the production or
manufacture of commodities through
a regulation of commerce as it has to
accomplish the same end after trans
portation has ended."

Deaths in the flood on lllair's creek,
I'laiborno county, Tenn., increased to
tt late tonight. From parties who
have returned from the stricken d ta
li id It was learned that Thomas Mc
Lee, his wife and seven children, and
Rob Chaiiiley and his wife, have been
added to the lost of drowned.
Tho water was reported to be very
slow in subsiding, and for that rea
son the creek had not In-en followed
the entile distance, ten miles, to Its
month. I 'nt 1 1 this is done tt will not
be known how many ih-isoiis have
been drowned.
So far only four bodies have been
found. Everything along IllaJd's creek
has been wasln-d away. In some
places the water had run up on the
mountainside thirty feet.
D. C. Edmonds, whose wife and
onr children were drowned, escaped
after being washed for five miles
among driftwood. Two of Edmond s
children were found alive on drift
timber three miles from home. Ed
monds said he was awakened at .1
o'clock this morning by the roaring of
the Hood. Water was all around bis
house ,-uid a foot deep on the floor.
Itefore he could awaken his family,
the building was moved from its

ed to reach Washington in a day or
two and officials believe the commis
sion's deliberations may begin within

Official announcement in Mexico
City today that Mexican commission
ers already had been selected was
taken as a sign that tho American
suggestion for broadening the scope
of subjects to be considered at the
conferences probajjly had been ac
cepted. Neither tho Mexican embassy
nor tho state department, however,
had been officially advised tonight re
garding selection of the commission
ers or General Carranza's decision as
to the matters they will discusa.
No Comment .Made.
While no formal comment was
made at the department in ail Vance
of official notification, there was
nothing to indicate that the three
commissioners named, Messrs. Ca
brera, Konillas and 1'uni, would not
be entirely acceptable to department
officials. President Wilson has a
score of men under consideration for
appointment as the American repre
sentatives, but it is understood he has
not attempted so far to make u
choice.
There aro many indications that
a high army officer will be one of
'those selected by the president be
cause of the military nature of the
problems to be considered. Major
iGeneral Goethals has been mentioned.
iThe other men wider consideration
i include members of the supreme court
'and men in close touch with coinmer
! cial and financial conditions.
! Department officials have refused
to discuss what matters In addition to
the military situation on the border
they desire the commission to treat.
; It is known, however, that the pos
sibility of arranging financial aid for
the de facto government has been
j talked over.
I The commission's power will be
! only that of recommendation. What
I ever plan It may propose, either for
settling the border situation for with

ico, or for any other purpose must
! be ratified before it Is any way bind

today that the underwater freighter

Captain Hinsch added that after
the officers and members of the crew
had given three cheers for America,
he heard Captain Koenig give the
order "diving stations." At that, time
the vessels were about a mile off the
capes. The submarine increased her
speed and the men aboard the Tiin

her as she sped for the open sea. A

He added It would be unwise for
him to disclose whether the vessel

striking out to sea, or whether she
steered an easterly course straight

Federal Probe.
WASIIIIINGTON, Aug. 3. While
the strike vote of 400,000 rail
road employes was being counted In
New York, ever) agency of the fed
eral government affected by the situ
ation was preparing today to do all
possible to avert a final break be
tween the railroads and the workmen.
William K Chambers, commissioner
of the board of mediation and con
ciliation, was in communication with
President Wilson during the day
though board officials pointed out
that nothing of a formal character
could be done until tho railroad
managers and representatives of the
employes resumed negotiations next
Week.
Cull Is Issued,
A call was Issued for a meeting to
morrow morning of the senate com
merce committee to decide whether
hearings will be held on Chairman
Newlands' resolution proposing an
Investigation by the interstate com
merce commission of hours of labor
on railways and urging the employers
and employes to postpone a settle
ment of their differences until a re
port can be made. Hours of labor
constitutes one of the chief causes of
the threatened strike.
The chamber of commerce of the
I'nlled States which yesterday ap
pealed to President Wilson for fed-c-ul
intervention to prevent a strike.
Is urging action on the resolution.
The chan. her Is considering calling
a conference of representatives of
commercial organizations to Impress
on congress the necessity of taking1
sonic Immediate step.
If all other steps fail to avert a
Ktrike, it Is probable President Wil
son will miiko a personal appeal t
the railroad managers and the em.
ployes urging them to effect n settle
ment in the interest of the public. The
question may be discussed at tomor
row's cabinet meeting.
