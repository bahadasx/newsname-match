Anglo-French Drive
j After Five Weeks
Success and Failure of the Allies at the Somme and the
F.ffect Upon the Russian Attack?What the
Present \ lalt in the West Signifies.
I
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
After five weeks it is patent that the Anglo-French offenaive ha*, j
I come to one of those halts which are the familiar deUil of contcmporary l
! operations, when the attack fails to picrce the onemy lines in the open-j
: in? thrust. Berlin is amply justified in its assertion that tho etTort to
pierce the Somme front has ao far failed; it may be warranted in its as?
sertion thnt the effort has permanently failed, but of that there is no proof.
Golnj back to the Verdun precedent, we shall find interestinp evi-j
denee. The (rermans attacked the Krench first line on February 23. They
. made very material progTfff "'or several days, rather more than the
| Ang'.o-Freneh drive has made. but on a mueh narrower front. Thon came a
markltd pauaa. There was a renewal of desperate effort and material
profraaa In March. but 11 was not until April 9 that there was ajrain
undertaken a wholesale and tremendous attack.
The more careful of European military critics in the Allied or neu- j
tral journals have agreed that the check of April 9 marked the absolute
failure of the German effort to pierce the Freneh lines at Verdun, and
that from that date onward the atruggle took on a different charactor nnd
became siege warfare, and not i> piereir.g operation.
We are all familiar with the reasons for the lullfl o." pauses in these
attacks. NtW stores of ammunition have to be brought up. Heavy artil?
lery has to be moved forwar.l to .the new lines when a sueeessful attack
has gained several miles. Fresh divisions have to be put in to replace
those used up by prrvious effort.
Now. it is eertain thnt within a few days we shall see another Anglo
French attack wholly analogous t/i the German operation of April 0 be?
fore Verdun. It may be that this will fail to pierce the German lines. If
it does, the Verdun example will ju.rtly eontribute to creating the impres
sion that the ehance of piereing tbe lines on the Somme front has passed.
since so many weeks have been allowed to the Germans to prepare new
defences behind the threatened point. Then we must look for a eontinuation
of the attack here along the lines that Verdun has made familiar or else
expect. an attack at some other point on the Western front.
But, having pointed out the resemblances to the Verdun operation. it
is necessary to emphasize the differenres. First of all. the Somme opera?
tion is not. like that at Verdun. an isolated operation. With no other
business on her hands at the moment Germany turned all her resources
Bgainat France and tried to put her out of the war by a sudden and
colossal blow at Verdun. But the Anglo-Freneh operation at the Somme
i is only one part of the Allied o'Tensive.
Thus. while the Germans have temporarily or pe.rmanently held up

Indianapolis. Aug. 3. Plans for the

FEW CREWS WIL QU1T,
ROADS' HEADS DECLARE
Ultimatum Which Threatens the
Manhattan and Queens Surface
Lines Expires at 3 P. M.
I. R. T. EMPLOYES PLEDQE
LOYALTY, SHONTS SAYS
Subway and "L" Out Wednesday, B. R. T.
by End of Week, Is Threat?Second
Ave. Organizes.
The outstanding developmenta in the strike situation
yesterday were theae:
1. Demanda for union recognition and higher wagea
were preaented to the New York Railwaya Company, opera
tora of the green cara in Manhattan. and the New York &
Queena County Road. The ulUnvatuma expire at 3 o'clock
thia afternoon. Meetinga of employea to act upon the com
paniea' aruwera will be held to-night.
2. Mayor Mitchel'a conference with omciale of the two
companiea and the union officials failed to arrive at a method
for a peaceful aettlement of difficulties.
3. Oacar Straui, chairman of the Public Service Com
miaaion, wamed both aidea that any action by either to aggra
vate the present situation would prejudice ita case before the
public The union officials proteated in vain againat the
chairman a atatement and then decided to pay no attention
to it.
4. Labor leadera threatened to eall atrikea on the aub
waya and elevated linea in Manhattan and The Bronx by next
Tueaday or Wednesday if demanda of employea on theae
roads, similar to the other demanda but not yet formulated,
were not conceded. . They threatened to do the aame thing
for the B. R. T. linea by the end of the week.
5. Demanda for union recognition and higher wagea
for employea on the Second Avenue surface line, a amaller
aeparate company operating in Manhattan, have been drawn
and will probably be preaented to-day.
The threatened tie-up of surface car lines ln Manhattan and
Queens within twenty-four hours depends solely upon the ability
of the labor leaders to execute their threat to get enough men
to quit their jobs. Developments yesterday indirated that there
appears to be no chance of averting strikes on these lines and
all other surface, subway and elevated lines in the greater city.
The only hope some five million New Yorkers have of avoid
ing a complete city-wide halting of cars rests upon the strength
which the contending forces, the transit companies and the-; labor
leaders, ean muster when the battle lines are drawn.
Peace Fading Rapidly.
Demands for union recognition and higher wages were pre
sented yesterday to the New York Railways Company, operating
the green cars in Manhattan, and the New York & Queens
County Railway. The employes' uitimatums expire at 9 o'eloek
this afWnoon. Meetings of the two sets of earmen, aggregat
ing about 4,500 operators of half as many cars in the two bor
OUgfas, will be held to-night to act. upon the companies' answer.
Chances of a peaceful solution in the interim are decidedly slim.
