TAG DAY IN EAST JORDAN
Tag day in East Jordan on Saturday
for the benefit of the Michigan Child
Welfare League to aid them in their
work of hunting uu and caring for
crippled or handicapped children
proved a success in spite of the extreme
heat. The finance committee who re
ceived the funds collected, Mrs. E. A.
Ashley, A. Cameron, Dr. Hugh W.
Dicken and Mayor A. E. ' Cross report
the amount collected as $51.00. This
will be directed to the work of the
League in East Jordan and Charlevoix
County. Many children from this coun
ty have already received assistance
from the League and been cured or
greatly benefited. Some cases in East
Jordan were reported to the District
Superintendent and each one will be
carefully investigated and aid gladly
given.
The Michigan Child Welfare League
and Mrs. Mildred B. Kennedy wish to
thank each person who in any way
contributed in any way to make the
day a success. '
The local committee, Mrs. A. Cameron
Mrs. D. H. Fitch, Mrs. W. Robertson,
Miss Darnett, Mrs. Hugh W. Dicken,
Mrs. W. C. Merchant and Mrs. A. E.
Cross and to the young people who so
kindly offered the heart shaped tags
for sale on the streets. To the citizens
of East Jordan for their generous re
sponse to the appeal for the crippled
child.
Desides helping the crippled children
to get well, the League aids families
where poverty threatens to break up
the home. Mothers are pensioned by
the League so that they may keep
their children with them. The Michi
gan Child Welfare League is incorpor
ated, non-sectarian and highly approv
ed by the State Board of Corrections
and Charities. The work of the League
is supported entirely by voluntary gifts
of the people, membership fees and
proceeds from tag day sales.

"I hate being locked up here in this

"Oh, I don't think it's so bad," said
the Fire.
"It's easy enough for you to talk,"
said the Furnace. "Fires can go out,
but Furnaces can't.
"How did you happen to see all
these things you tell us about?" asked
the Coalbin of the Saw.
"The same way I saw everything
else.'.said the Saw; with my teeth."
"I hear you called on the Refrigera

the Pail. "Were you received pleas

with great coldness," said the Fail.
"This house is beautiful upstairs,"
said the Furnace to the Poker. "The

and they told me all about it."

Drowns Sunday
at Walloon Lake
Frank Laura Loses His Life
While Bathing
Frank Laura, a young farmer living
near Boyhe City, was drowned Sunday
evening at Walloon Lake, when he
was seized with cramps while bathing
in the South Arm. He died before
help could reach him, although several
friends were in bathing near him at
the time.
He leaves a wife and an eight week's
old child, besides his mother and sev
eral brothers and sisters. The body
was recovered within a half hour after
he sank. Although a physician was
immediately sent for and worked over
him for more than an hour nothing
could be done for him.
The funeral was held Tuesday and
burial was made at Boyne City Ceme
tery. FORMER PROSECUTOR

ELBERT BEDE SAYS
Russians are great tea drinkers.
A young man makes a mistake when
he inflates his income in bragging to
his sweetheart, for if a marriage fol
lows the wife is likely to guide her ex

the income is and hubby will hate to
own up that he lied. '

We are puzzled to know where some

When a woman gets to wondering

Men are either going around looking

. After a man kas been foolish enough
to wait eight years for a girl to make

kick about waiting the rest of his life

whether he dare kiss a girl she is prob

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
The President couldn't even sign the
rural credits bill without making a
speech-and in this one he told how his
heart had ached for the farmer who
found it ko hard to borrow money.
Therefore the President has signed a
bill which compels the borrowing far
mer first to buy some stock in a rural
credit association, then to limit the
amount of money he wants to borrow,
then to confine the use of his borrowed
money to a few objects, and then to
take a long number of years in paying
off the debt no matter how much he
may accumulate meantime.
Judging from the comment of Demo

It is small wonder that the old-line
Democrats are objecting to the pre
sence of Progressives on their cam
paign committee. Mighty few Pro
gressives are going to vote the Demo
cratic ticket this fall-certainly not in
numbers proportionate to even one
member of a committee of a dozen
members. Consequently, to give a
Progressive a place that might be taken
by a deserving Democrat is a sheer
waste of a job.

"If you want to make this fight on

blushing red against the skies," bawl
ed Collier of Mississippi, to the Re
publicans, while delivering a home
consumption speech on the seven
headed revenue measure which recent
ly passed the House. All right, Ms.
Collier. And the Republican party is
going to place a firm grip on each one
of your long, furry ears and point you
to the wide-furrowed warfields of
Europe blushing red with the blood of
countless thousands slain with shot and
shrapnel "made in Americr," carried
to the front on American trucks and
railroad cars, and fired from American
guns, the manufacture of which revived
the furnace fires, which, under the
smothering influence of the Demo
cratic tariff law, were mere heaps of
ashes before the European war broke
out. Can you meet that argument?
Some highly sensitive observers who
make a fetich of figures have been
pointing out Hughes' vote for Governor
in 1908. The main thing to be remem
bered from that campaign, however, is
that Hughes was re-elected in 1908 and
that no Governor of New York has been
re-elected since.
The biography of President Hayes
which Prof. John W. Burgess has just
published calls to mind the fact that it
was during the Hayes administration
that Diaz came to power in Mexico.
"Mr. Hayes", says his biographer, 'was
not more pleased with the way Diaz
came to the Presidency than was Mr.
Wilson with the supposed or assumed
complicity of Huerta in the killing of
Madero, and there were the same vio
lations of and dangers to American in
terests and the same boundary infrac
tions to be dealt with. But Mr. Hayes
was a practical statesman of refined
manners and to Mexico were vouchsa
fed thirty-five years of such peace and
prosperity as it had never before en
joyed." The reflection on Mr. Wilson
is none too harsh. .
The Democratic platform'of this year
does not follow its Baltimore prede
cessor by incorporating a declaration
that the pledges of the document are
made to be observed in office as well
as to be used in seeking votes. The
reason for the omission is entirely
clear. The promises of the Baltimore
platform were so much more uniform
ly honored in the breach rather than in
the observance that the Democrats this
year sought to duck the obvious and
individious and odious comparison.
However, it is of small consequence,
because the St. Louis platform is not
the document which will be invoked
during the next four years. The chart
for this country's progress during that
time was drafted at Chicago in the Re
publican, convention.
Cranford (N.J.) Citizen Mr. Hughes
will be elected and we trust the control

offices and increasing expenses of ad
ministration. HOTEL NAMES
If the rooms are dirty and the slop
Jar Is cracked and the heaters, suffer
ing from chronic chill lasting from Oc
tober to April, if the writing stand has
only three legs and is propped against
the wall. If the extra comforter on Lho
foot of the two inch thick hammock
esque bed looks as if it had been us
ed as a road drag after a recent rain,
if there is only one towel (about the
size of a handkerchief and made of
cheesecloth), if the wall paper Is
hanging loose from the ceiling and
peeling off from the walla, it Is The
Palace.
If ever an Indian lived within forty
miles of that place, especially a chief,
the hotel is called by that chief's
name; Poweshiek, Cherokee, Iroquois,
Otsego anything like that, jist sd It
is an Indian chief's name.
Now Just why they should name
perfectly good hotel after au extreme
ly dead and unhousebrokeu Indian Is
more than my dopesheet can inform
me. They might as well name a pill
after a Christian Scientist think of
the Mary Baker O. Eddy Little Liver
Pellet I a brand of soap after a hobo,
an ulster after a Papuan, knee-length
underwear after an Eskimo, a brand
of cocktail after Bryan or a Califor
nia city after a Jap, as to name a ho
tel after an Indian chief.
The only way one of those old time
Indian sachems could have been got
nto one of these good hotels espec
ially one with a bath in it, would hare
been to blindfold him and back him in.
If you had got him there once and
showed him the nappery and the four
walled bedrooms and the fire escapes,
and the other devices suggesting
snares and deadfalls, he would have
broken forth with a piercing screech
and been hard to catch.
Indians are all right, and so aro
some hotels. But why this mania for
naming a hotel that gets Just as far
from the old time Indian's way of liv
ing as possible why name that rocco
palace after the old time Indian chief
tain, Just because the old scalp-artist
is dead and can't resent it? '
The other regular names for hotels
are The Inn, The Commercial, The
Waldorf and the Parker House. In
Canada, all the small town hotels are
named after the King. And if ever he
stopped at some of them incog., he
would have the proprietor drawn and
quartered for ' lese majeste. From
Judge.
Time.
Time is something to miss trains by
and to buy things on. It is often rep
resented by a picture of a bald-headed
old individual carrying a hugo
scythe in one hand and an hour glass
in the other. lie is supposed to flop
the hour glass upside down at 12 p.
m. or a. m. New Year's eve. The
scythe is supposed to represent his
propensity for cutting people off in
the heyday of their lives. It is a mis
take to represent time as a man who
cannot recommend anybody's brand
of hair restorer, but can sit for a pic
ture of a man who attributes his hale
old age to malt whiskey and pipe to
bacco. Time should be represented
by a lady, because nobody can tell by
looking at ladies nowadays how old
they are. There are also several var
ieties of Time among them being
Good Time, High Old Time, Dull Time
Meal Time and Bed Time. Of the
plural varieties of tie may be mention
ed Hard Times, which is sufficient to
think of at the present time. Time Is
measured by clocks, also by waiting
for street cars, and by taxi-cab me
ters, which if not carefully watched
will register all the time there is and
draw on several aeons of eternity.
Another Interesting variety of time is
the Last Time, which has to do with
intoxicating liquors, good night klssea
and getting to work late. From
