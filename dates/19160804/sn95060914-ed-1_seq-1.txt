The Deutschland passed out of
the Virginia capes at 830 oclock
Wednesday night on her home
ward voyage and apparently un
observed by the allied warships
waiting for her outside the three
mile limit She was accompanied
by the tug Timmins and a news
paper dispatch boat
Her departure to sea followed j
an eighteen mile dash through
the lower Chesapeake bay and
she reached the capes just after
dusk It was noted that the al
lied cruisers were visible when
she passed through j
It is unknown whether she
submerged before reaching the
three mile limit as the two ac
companing boats only know she
disappeared unharmed and ap
parently had a clear field to a
point where it was possible to
completely submerge safely The
submarine remained secluded at
Tangier island part of Wednes
day
When a mile from the press
boat she began to clear away
the straw colored false super
structure as if preparing to dive
and the tug Timmins passed out
of the capes first to determine
whether the allied warships were
waiting The tug signaled that
the Deutschland had a clear path
and the submersible hastened
down the channel to the sea
Captain Hiusch of the Tim
mins said the crew of the
Deutschland gave three cheers
for America and Americans just
as she started to sea

A NEW FLOUR MILL FAIRVIEW MEETING
Will Soon Be Erected by the
Gila Valley Milling
Company
Leo Goldschmidt president of
the Gila Valley Milling Co was
a visitor in town for several days
this week coming over from
Tucson Saturday evening
While here Mr Goldschmidt
discussed the proposition of a
new mill with his manager F
L Ginter and became convinced
that the valley farmers were
making a success with their wheat
crop and increasing the acreage
to such an extent that a new mill
was absolutely necessary
As a result of this visit Mr
Goldschmidt has issued orders to
his engineers who are supervis
ing the building of a 75000
bushel capacity elevator for his
mill at Tucson to come here
when thru with that work and
prepare plans for the erection of
a modern daylight reinforced
concrete mill building with a
capacity of 150 barrels of flour
per day
All the machinery in the new
building will be of the latest type
with ball bearing shafts The
building will be practically built
of concrete and lighted on all
sides with heavy glass windows
making an absolutely uptodate
sanitary roller mill and perfect
cleanliness in all operations
In addition to the new mill an
elevator of 100000 bushels capac
ity built of reinforced concrete
will also be built alongside of the
new mill building
Both buildings will be erected
on the companys lot south of
the railroad tracks on Twelfth
street and alongside of the big
iron warehouse erected by the
company several years ago
Mr Goldschmidt expects to
break ground for the new build
ings before Christmas and have
the buildings completed in time
to take care of next years wheat
and barley crops
The old mill will run until new
mill starts up when it will be
closed down forever The old
building will be razed and the
plot of ground divided up into
city lots
