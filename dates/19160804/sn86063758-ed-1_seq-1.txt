Reviewing cotton condition? for the
month, the bureau of -crop estimates
said: "The month ending July 25 has
m been only fair for cotton in most of
b ^the belt west of the Mississippi river

t "Rains in the drought stricken
southern coastal regidn of Texas permitted
the planting of a considerable
late acreage. The crop in the WestI
)
ern belt 'is well cultivated and mois*
ture conditions have been favorable,
although the need for rain is now beginning
to be felt.
F "East of the Mississippi a severe
stnrm fhroueh Dortions of
Florida, Alabama .and iMississlppi
early in July and an extremely heavy
downpour at mid-July in the arolinas,
together with heavy and almost
constant rains during July throughout
the entire Eastern belt have put the
crop badly in the grass, leached out
much of already deficient amount of
fertilizer and greatly facilitated the
activity of the - boll weevil, where
present, and its continued spread. Th?
rains at the close of the period in the
Eastern belt were preventing much
needed cultivation."
L Condition of the growing cotton
crop on July 25 indicates a total proW
duction of 12,916,000 equivalent 500
f pound bales. That compares "with
14,266,000 bales forecast last month
by the bureau of crop estimates bas
ing its calculations on the condition

Conditions of the crop on July 25 as
compiled from reports of agents iand
correspondents in the cotton belt was
placed at 72.3 per cent, of a normal,

7S.5, the ten year average on July 25.
-During the month storms caused
some damage to the crop. In the Erst
week weather was favonabH -.n. most
places and the crop made satisfactory

favorable conditions, some fields were
irregular and Tn places the plants
were small and backward. Boll

crop in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama,

Accepting the statement that a small j t

1 I fnr farm nrn- ! l
X* .1 X UMIAV MM i_ . ^
duce. This could be run in coopera-1 :
tion with a wholesale produce house, j ^
I creating both a local and an outside ' 2
demand for the farmer's goods, thus i
|
. stimulating the art of truck farm- \
! ing. i (
! 2. A Trust Company which would ; 1
give the small as well as the large j
i testator a guarantee of an equitable j:
settlement of his estate for a small j 2
' nominal fee. This would encourage j (
! tne placing or estates m nauus ui. j i
j competent public officials, giving to j i
i incompetent heirs their rightful prop- ! i
: erty, and an opportunity investment 1
J for saving it. SucIl a company could <

still smaller plant which seems to be '
j a profitable business, is that manu- (

4. A City Hospital. According to ?

support a small hospital. There is a 1
- . /
; general conception of its economic j
value, especially as to the health, of 1
j the community. 1

6. A Live Chamber of Commerce j
j run on the cooperative plan. In fact
. such an organization is essential to

i encourage tne promotion or an enterS
prises and institutions.
Being alive to the necessity of these :
| we gain the attention and respect of ,

Capt. Koenig and his crew of 27 i

6EKATE ADOPTS
RELIEF MEASURE
Southern Members Prepared to
Meet Any Opposition to Urgent
Necessity Bill.
Washington, Aug. 1.?Without a
dissenting vote the senate today pass- j
cd- the .pint resolution providing fori
an appropriation of .>."40.000 for the '
relief of the flood sufferers in North j
riouth Carolina and Alabama.
Tomorrow Representative Harrison of
Vis.-.issippi, a member of the house
rules committee, will ask t'.;e hoase
ro adopt the resolution. As tomorrow
is unanimous consent day a single
objection would, prevent the passage .
01 tne resolution.
But Southern members are prepared
for such, an emergency and
oald there be objeeticn, Representative
Pou of North Carolina, chair- ;
man of the rales committee, will bring ;
in i special rule providing for the I
passage of the measure.
The money is expected therefore to'
he available for use within a very fe-v j
days. It is to be disbursed under the j
direction of the secrefarv of war and :
i
will provide immediate relief for i
tnose wno neea tooa, ciotnmg ana
medicine. It will also provide for,
I
seeds which can be used for crops
maturing before the first frosts.
In combating the Republican op-1
position to the measure when it was
introduced early today by Senator
Underwood, Southern senators assert- {
ed that conditions were far worse I
than had been represented in press ;
dispatches and that in no other way i
than by federal, relief couki destitution
vbe/met. i
"Thy disaster in these Southern I
St-arWs is .,s great proportionately as
the San Francisco earthquake or the
Uiiio flood." saia senator unaerwooa. i
"The general public does not realize
this because many of the districts are
remote and lines of communication j
have been destroyed tin s making it
impossible to get all the details before
the public.''
Senators Smoot <and Penrose ledj
the fight azainst inr.ie Ijate considera- j
tion of the resosu'u;;. They assert-^
ed that it was but an illustration of
Democratic extravagance :-,nd insist- j
en tnat tne resolution ne reierrea 10 :
the appropriations committee for con-!
sideration. Senator Smoot said hej
did not know what the people of
Utah, who had often suffered disas
ters to croo without being according i
federal aid. would think o! the appro- ;
priation if ,-igreed to.
Senators Overman, Simmons, 'Smith
of South Carolina, Vardaman, Bankhead.
Randsell and others spoke in
favor of immediate action hp the
senate, but the measure finally was
referred to committee. The appropriations
committee immediately was
called in special session and, alter'
'hearing a repor? from the war department
describing the extent of the
disaster and recommending relief for
the homeless people, it recommended
that the senate adopt the resolution.
When the measure finally was reported
it was put through the senate
out of the regular order of business
without opposition.

Demand for l&tincation of Republiean
Nomination Brings Chorus of
Indignation.
New Orleans, Aug". 1.?The Louisiana.
St^te Progressive convention held
'Tip~? tndnv indorsed the nomination of,
John M. Pp.rVrer for vice president,
but did not ratify the national committee's
action in indorsing Charles
E. Hughes, Republican nominee for
president. Instead the convention
adopted a resolution instructing that
Mr. Parker's name be placed on the
ballot under the Bull Moose emblem,

reserved for the name of the candidate
for president he left blank. The
ten presidential electors selected were
instructed as to the candidate for
whom they should vote if elected.

all parts of the hall. Tho chairman
ruled the speaker out of order and
after considerable confusion he sat
down.
In the resolutions committee there
was a sharp contest over a proposed

Resolution Binding Majority Members
Clears Way for Fight on

Washington, July 31.?Democratic
senators in caucus tonight voted to
postpone action on the immigration
bill until the next session of congress
and adopted, 38 to 0, a resolution
binding all Democratic senators to
that decision. A resolution then wa3
adopted, 32 to 7, pledging the majority
to vote down any attempt to attach
the immigration measure to the child
labor bill as a rider.
The binding resolution, the first of
that nature imposed by a Democratic
caucus for several years, was put
fhrmi?rh hv nartv leaders to whiD into
line a group of Southern senators
who had announced they would support
an effort to saddle the child labor4
bill, which they oppose, with an immigration
rider including the literacy
test section in the hope that President
Wilson would veto it. The seven senitors
who voted against the resolution.
pledging defeat of the immigration
rider were Senator Bankhead and
rnderwoo-d of Alabama, ' Martin anc
Swanson of iVirginia, Simmons and,
Overman of North Carolina and Beck- j
ham of Kentucky. It stated that any
amendment introducing a subject not
germane to child labor legislation

The Russians, according to the

continuing their forward march
against the Teutons in the Stokhod
river region of Volhynia, and there
have captured the entire Thirty-first

arraigned senators who he said were
seeking to displace the senate's regu

al and warned his colleagues that they
j might as well reserve their political
arguments for the stump because the
j newspapers would not print them and
[ they only would "slumber in The Con^

senate gallery and addressing himself
to the correspondents he continued:
*Tf you fellows exerc.se good judg

of this political debate. If you use
more, your editors probably will
throw it into the waste basket."
"Those fellows up there," he added,
turning tagain to the senate, "when
they hear us wrangling about thes?
political arguments, merely go out
side and eay to each other. 'The dcgs
are barking again.'"
