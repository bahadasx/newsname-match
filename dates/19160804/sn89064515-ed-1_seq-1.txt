HIGHEST BIDS ACCEPTED BY
CITY COUNCIL FOR BOTH MA
CHINE AND OIL
A pressure road oil machine and a
10,000 gallon tank of asphaltuni road
•oil were purchased by the city council
at a meeting Tuesday evening at the
-itv hall. Aldermen Hall, Moeglein,
Blake, Brown, LaFond and Farrow
were '^rtsent.
Only two bids were received for the
road oil machines, one from the Stu
tlebaker company of Minneapolis and
the other from' the Austin-Western
Road Machinery company of Chicago..
The first named company's prices were
lower than the latter, but the council
believed that the Austin Western ma
chine to be far superior to the other.
•The bids of the Sfudebaker company
were $580.00 for a 600-gallon machine
Avith hotter attachment or $510.00
without heater, and $465.00 for a 450
galloin machine without heater and
$415.00 for the same kind without cer
tain parts. The bid of the Austin
Western company was for one machine
only, the 450-gallon machine with heat
er attachment, for $622.50. Mr. Ek
berg, representative for the machine
which the council purchased, stated
that the machine is absolutely a one
man affair. The other machine requires
two operators, although the agent said
that an attachment could be furnished
to make it a one-man machine but that
this was not practical.
For road oil there were three bids,
one from the Reliance Oil company ®f
Minneapolis for 6.9 cents per gallon
f. o. b. Little Falls, or 6.05 f. o. b.
Minneapolis anofher was from the
Standard Oil company, at 5.21 cents
per gallon f. o. b. Little Falls and
the third was from a concern in Texas
City, Texas, at 6.25 cents per gallon,
freight allowed at the rate of 36.2
cents per hundred to Little Falls. The
council deemed it best to get the very
highest gTade of road oil and the first
named bid was accepted.
The application of L. V. Tanner to
cement the brick wall on the south
side of the St. Paul store building, and
to put on a new fire-proof roofing,
was granted.
ED. FRASER DIDN'T JOIN NAVY
In OUT last week's issue we stated
that Fred Fraser of Bemidji, a former
Little Falls boy, had joined the navy,
and that his brother Ed. was in the
navy in "western waters. This was an
error to the extent that Fred did not
join the regular navy but the naval"
militia and his trip to Newport, R. I.,
was a part of a cruise and he was gone
for only ten days. The name Jack
.should have been in place of the name
"Ed., Jack having been in the regular
army service for over four years, now
"being located at Guam, Marine Islands,
where he went after the Vera Cruz
trouble. Leo Fraser is with the Na
tional guard at the border. The above
information was conveyed by Ed. Fra
ser, who resides at Minneapolis, and is
pursuing the peaceful walks of life.

AU?0 HIT BY TRAIN
An autQjjbobile driven by a travel

pant was not in the car at the time.
He had attempted to cross the tracks
at a crossing which he thought was

crossing, and the fence hindered him
from getting through. He saw the
train coming at a distance and, with

was only slight, however, one wheel

SECRETARY OF MUNICIPAL REF
ERENCE BUREAU SENDS THE
CLERK INTERESTING MATTER
City Clerk Victor Schallern has re
ceived some very interesting literature
from E. L. Bennett, secretary of tht»
Municipal Reference Bureau of the
Minnesota League of Municipalities, in
regard to electric lignt and water pow
er franchises. The information was.
furnished by the league upon request
of the city clerk, following a meeting
of the city council on Thursday eve
ning of last week, at which the pro
posed extension of the Water Power
company's light and power franchise
was brought up, when City Attorney
Cameron suggested writing to them.
The city of Little Falls is a member of
this .league.
Mr. Bennett sent a memorandum of
items from late franchises, showing
the more important clauses which he
believed should be included in a fran
chise, together with a copy of the wa
ter franchise at Crookston, which has
some very fine features. He also wrote
tbe city clerk a letter, explaining the
literature he sent, and in addition,
made a brief statement in regard to
the hypothecating of franchises, whieh.
the Water Power compan- of this city
contemplates doing. Following is an
excerpt from his letter in regard to
this matter:
"I note from a newspaper story
that your company is contemplat
ing hypothecating the franchises
on its financiering of the exten
sion. Permit me to suggest that a
bit of caution would be wise here.
It is agreed by virtually everyone
who has studied the matter and
confirmed by the experience of
cities throughout the country that
the franchise should not be re
garded as a financial asset of the
company which can be used as a
source of revenue by bartering or
sale."
A few items from the memorandum,
which Mr. Bennett sent which are in
corporated in franchises allowed in.
these later years, ar6:'
"Grantee to make annual report to*
municipality, showin- extent of plant,
extensions made, increase or dimuni
tion of equipment, current sold at
scheduled rates, by classes and num
ber of consumers, gross income, etc."
"Grantee's books to be open to in
spection of public, or of municipality's
designated agents or officers, and to
all arbitrators and appraisers.''
Another clause which was contained
1,1
Crookston franchise was one
providing that the company should put
all streets or alleys or other places
whese their equipment was installed,
back into the same condition as they
were found when work was begun and
that the company make all repairs on"
such streets or alleys due to such in-,
jrliHations for a period of two vears
thereafter.
Many other clauses were suggested
in the memorandum which are not in-,
i^ded in the proposed franchise ol
the local company and they will no
doubt be read at the meeting of the
city council when the ordinance for
the extension of the franchise is con
sidered.
