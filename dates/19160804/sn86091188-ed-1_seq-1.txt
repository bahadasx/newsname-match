and Their Prosperity
While recently vidtlng Salt 1 *ke
K K. Kirkpatrick, the Leesburg min
mg man, Inst no opportunity to «ai
word about the Lemhi activités In
Ids line, being quoted lJje Tr|bune
" t J en "' h - faking of his trip he
told The Recorder that he met
j *'Kood many former acquaintances.
1 ravp * seemed to lie very heavy, indi
cating the tremendous business' boom
that is everywhere n an if est. On the
trip Mr. Kirkpatrick visited the
mines and reduction works at Blng
hara. He was gratifier! to see that the
Short Line Rallnmtlias given promi
nence in their advertising literature
to the Sawtooth-Salmon touring
company. The Tribune quotes the
Salmon visitor as follows;
More properties in Lemhi are
being equipped for active mining
operations and there are more
companies operating and snipping
ore than for a number of years.
One pronourmed addition to the
mineral output during the past
six months lias been the product
lion of high-grade tungsten con
centrates, the output for one
month amounting to more than
40,000. according to Mr. Kirkpat
rick.
At Shoup, sixty miles north of
Salmon, Grove & Sons are operat
ing a property that has been idle
for the past ten years. They are
engaged in mining and milling a
gold ore and have in operation «
ten-stamp mill. The gold values
are saved by plate amalgamation
and the remaining values are re
covered in the concentrates and
shipped by parcel post to the
smeltars.
On Agency creek, east of Sal
mon, ttie Seattle-Idaho Mining
company has recently installed
three carloads of macninerv and
prepared to work the property to
great depth. The values are in
high-grade copper ore and in gold
ore.
R. E. Wickham has for more
than a yea- been systematically
developing a group of claims con
taining gold ores. The property
is located a short distance north
of salmon. He has opened up
several shoots of ore that is said
to average $200 in gold lo the ton
and has recently erected a stamp
mill on the property and is now
engaged in milling the ore
Several owners ot properties in
which the ores cariy a high per
centage of copper expect to begin
shipping in the near future to the
smeller», as copper at the pre-ent
quotations will net them a hand
some profit.
The Niekel-Colialt mines, lo
cated at Leesburg, have been ex
amined recently by engineers said
to be employed by eastern manu
facturers who are desirous of us
ing the metal in certain manu
facturing line*.
In the southern portion of the
county the mines at Gilmore con
tinue to strip with regularity,
there having beer produced dur
ing 1915 In the neighborhood of
*1,000,000 wortli of ore. In ad
dition to the I -de and placer
mine*, two gold dredges are at
present operating
Three miles west of Salmon
Messrs. Kelly A Horn are d* vep
ing a group ol lead-silvei and

2000 feet underground work done
that has exposed an iminest ton
