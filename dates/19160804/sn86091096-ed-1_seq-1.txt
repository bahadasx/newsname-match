GOOD
THE POTLATCH
Clearwater County Has Best
Roads
. The traveling representative of
3ie Tribune last week made the
trip from Juliaetta via Leland,
Cavendish and Ahsahka to Orofino,
thence up the new Weippe-Ford's
creek grade to the Fraser-Weippe
country and on to Pierce.
On Big Potlatch ridge grain is
looking well and may rake close to
an average yield for that section.
The bean crop on the Potlatch is
looking exceptionally well and with
few exceptions the fields of beans
are practically free from weeds.
As one bean grower remarked, "If
the beans are not clean at this per
iod in their growth the grower
might as well give up, as it is now
too late to clean a crop and then
grow a paying crop of beans." It
is a remarkable fact that right in
the timber section, in the vicinity
of Southwick, Cavendish and Teak
ean fine crops of beans are being
grown this season and the crops
are well along in their develop
ment and promise a good vield.
Of the five counties in Idaho—La
tah, Nez Perce, Clearwater, Lewis
and Idaho—covered by the corre
spondent recently, beyond question
Clearwater county has the best
roads in general of the quintette
of counties. Take the grade from
Cavendish to Ahsahka; the river
road from Ahsahka to Orofino; the
Ford's creek road from Orofino to
Fraser and Weippe; the road from
Weippe to Pierce, and the grade
from Greer to Fraser; When the
steepness of the country through
which these roads run, the condi
tion of the road-bed, the drainage
artd the freeness of loose rock or
other kind of rock, are considered
motorists must take off their hats
to Clearwater county as to good
roads, as the writer has already
taken off his hat to that county.
In the Fraser-Weippe county
crops were looking most discour
aging up to a few weeks ago, when
a series of good rains began, with
the result that timothy and clover
—in fact oats and other grain
crops—look exceedingly well
throughout that sçctjj|j.
Between Fraser and Weippe the
writer saw a crew of^ men and
teams, the former in the employ
of and the latter owned by the
Scofield Lumber syndicate, at work
on the roads. And the kind of
roads that bunch is doing is of the
kind that counts for something,
not temporarily merely, but per
manently. We were told that
when the allowance made by the
board of county commissioners was
exhausted Mr. Scofield sent instruc
tions for the work to continue and
+hose steep grades to be lower,
if it had to be done free of
cost. The view is held by some
that should a railroad fail to build
into that section, this lumber com
pany will install a number of cat
erpillar engines to haul lumber
from the mills to the top of the
grades, or that they will install
these engines to transport the lum
ber until a railroad is ready to take
care of the traffic.
At Pierce one dredge is running
regularly while Gaffney and Thomp
son are constructing another dredge
to be used above Pierce three or
four miles.
Two heavy electric storms visited
the Pierce section last Wednesday
night, but if any fires wers started
the heavy rains accompanying the
storms put them out.
The correspondent was informed
that there is a fine crop of huckle
berries in the hills surrounding
Pierce and they are now at the be
NEZPERCE DEMOCRATS
T
Will Place Full Ticket in The
Field
Leading democrats of Nez Perce
countv, representing practically
every precinct, caucused Tuesday
night and decided to place a full
ticket in the field before the pri
maries. The meeting was attend
ed by over 50 delegates, who will
return to their homes with a deter
mination of carrying the democrat
ic banner to victory in the fall e
lections. It will be the purpose of
the party leaders to eliminate con
tests in the primaries as far as pos
sible in order that perfect harmony
may prevail for the campaign this
fall.
Up to the present time but one
candidate has been placed in nom
ination for the primaries and this
is Sheriff Harry Lydon, who was
brought out for reelection by
Henry Heitfeld. Other nomina
tions will be filed at once and assur
ances were given that a full ticket
will be named.
In the discussions Tuesday even
ing a number of candidates were
suggested and in a number of in
stances the candidates considered
have indicated their desires to
make the race. It will be the pur
pose of the party to bring out
strong men for the several county
offices and give all sections of the
county a representation in the ad
minsitration of the county's affairs.
County Chairman J. L. Arm
strong acted as chairman of the
caucus and Captain D. C. Wrighter
was secretary. The following are
the candidates suggested :
Commissioners—W. R. Wyatt,
Lewiston Orchards, first district;
Herbert Wright, Culdesac, secoué
district; W. J. Green, Lenore,
third district.
Stato senator— W. B. Stanton.
Representative— Dr. J. J. Herr
ington, Gifford.
Assessor—J. L. Armstrong, Lap
wai.
Sheriff—Harry Lvdon, Lewiston.
Surveyor—A. J. Warren, incum
bent.
It is stated candidates for the of
fices of school superintendent, pro
bate judge, treasurer and county
attorney will be nominated within
the next few days.
The last day upon which nomina
tions may be filed is Saturday and
it is proposed to have the ticket
filed before that time.

Carlson Won Match
The wrestling match between
Carlson and Hartinger, held at
Barnum's hall, last Saturday night,
was a brief affair. Hartinger
proved to be no match for Carl

about two weeks they will be at
their best.
T. B. Reed, who has a ranch and
meadow about two miles from
Pierce on the Weippe road, has |
demonstrated that the meadow land
which for years has been producing j
wild grass only, if turned over and
seeded to clover and timothy, will
show a double yield.
The view is held generally that
activities will be resumed in the
Weippe timber section at an early
date and such activities will re
sult in much prosperity throughout
this entire section.—Tribune.
CLOSEJMORROW
Can Register Before Judge
on Election Day
Latah county voters who want to
take part in the coming primary
election, September 5, and who are
not registered have only two days
which to do so. The registra
tion books close for thirty days be
ginning tomorrow night. All per
sons who did not vote in the gener
elections two years ago must
register before they will be eligible
vote in the primaries.
Voters may register before any
jnstice of the peace or any notary
public. Voters who have moved
from one precinct to another, or
who have moved to this county
from some other county, must pre
sent a transfer showing the change
of residence when they register.
Even when voters fail to regis
ter before the books close they still
have another chance on the day of
the election, when with the assist
ance of some registered freeholder
living in the same precinct who
will vouch for the voter's eligibility
they may go before the election
judge and be registered. This en
tails considerable time, and trouble
and voters will find registration
now more convenient than to wait
until the day of election.
On Highway Board
Moscow, Aug. 1.—Jerome J. Day
of Moscow was named and E. W.
Porter of Juliaetta was nominated
vice president of the North and
South Highway commission recent
ly organized at Lewiston, at the
chamber of commerce luncheon to
day. The purpose of the organiza
tion is to bring about a highway
connecting north and south Idaho,
and the northern counties are rep
resented by vice presidents and di
rectors. Mr. Porter has been
prominent in trying to secure a
highway from the Lolo pass up the
canyon, with Moscow as its termi
nal, and his connection with this
organization will enable him to se
cure the cooperation of a strong or
ganziation to bring the desired ob
ject about.
A vote of thanks was tendered
the Lewiston Commercial club for
its endeavors to secure the coopera
tion of Portland chamber of com
merce in the efforts of Idaho peo
ple to secure the research mining
station at Moscow in connection
with the University of Idaho.

FOR FALL DELIVERY
Boise Firm Will Pack Prunes
Here
C. J. Sinsel of Boise arrived in
Kendrick Monday and has been
looking over this section with a
view of buying prunes for shipping.
He had a fruit packing plant two
years ago in the building now
occupied by the Carlson Hardware
and bought a number of carloads of
prunes. He stated that the loss
from frosts in the Boise valley this
year is over two million dollars and j
that there will not likely be over j
two carlords of fruit shipped from
that valley this season.
The prune crop here is light but
but the quality is good. Probably
half a crop will be the average this
year. C. H. Garby has a splendid
crop but his orchard has had the
best of care ever since it was set
out. Mr. Sinsel made the remark
that it was one of the best looking
crops that he had seen this year.
All prune growers, whether they
have a large crop or a small one,
are urged to commmunicate with
C. G. Compton and give him a gen-,
eral idea as to the amount of prunes j
they will have to sell this fall. This
should be done so that an estimate
can be made as to the number of
boxes necessary to handle the crop
in this section. The price offered
this year is $31. a ton.
Day Withdraws Candidacy
J. J. Day, by failing to file his
acceptance of the nomination for
state senator within the five day
limit, has withdrawn from the race.
He was nominated by James J.
Keane on the democratic ticket.
M. E. Lewis is the only nominee
for the office from either party re
maining in the field. Up to the

NEZPERCE COUNTY
PROGRESSIVES MEET
Met at Lapwai And Selected
Candidates
The progressive convention, at
tended by 42 delegates represent
ing practically every part of Nez
Perce county, met at Lapwai last
Saturday and selected candidates
for the county offices. The pe
titions of nomination were filed
with County Auditor R. N. Wright
Lewiston.
The candidates were selected
after a proposal for harmony be
tween the progressives and repub
licans had been submitted by Fred
N. Shepherd of the republican
state central committee and C. T.
Stranahan of the republican county
central committee. Pleas for har
mony and a union of forces for
the selection of a county ticket
were made, the proposal seeming to
meet with such general favor that
motion was offered by Fred H.
Wood to the effect that a con
ference committee be named by the
progressive convention and that a
half hour recess be taken. This
motion brought a storm of protest
from Probate Judge O. D. Burns
and Probation Officer M. C. John
son and the matter was dropped,
the convention then proceeded with
the selection of candidates.
Resolutions commending the
county administration of the pro
gressive officers elected two years
ago, pledging the party and can
didates for law enforcements and
clean politics, were passed. The
chairman of the convention was D.
J. Wyatt of Webb ridge and M. C.
Johnson of Lewiston acted as sec
retary. The convention endorsed
the candidacy of J. L. Chapman,
republican candidate for treasurer,
and Attorney F. S. Randall of
Lewiston for the office of state re
presentative. The candidates nam
ed are as follow:
Commissioners — J. Alex Ferris,
first district; John Kennedy of Lap
wai, second district; L. J. South
wick, third district.
State senator — W. H. Bundy, of
Culdesac.

The following is the text of the
resolutions prepared by a commit

Culdesac; W. H. Bundy, Culdesac,
an( ^ R - R- Stookev, Lewiston:
"That we reaffirm our allegiance
to the principles as adopted, fought
for and won by the progressive
party of Nez Perce county in the
year 1914, towit: Clean county
government, the best men to be
had for the various offices, the
strict enforcement of all laws,
state and national.
"That the progressive party of
this county is strictly nonpartisan
and that principle should always
stand above party.
"That we pledge ourselves to
support the constitutional amend
m ent for state-wide prohibition and
f° r continuation of the present
Prohibition laws, and furthermore,
that we commend the work of the
progressive county officers."
