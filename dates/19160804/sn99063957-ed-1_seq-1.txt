Deputy District Attorney James Brcn

"The ring is larger than we at first

part and had no idea, probably, of
what the finals of their plotting would
be. Our mass of circumstantial evi

St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 4. The wheat
crop of the great "fcorthwest on both
sides of the American-Canadian line,
was so seriously damaged today by hail
storms and tornadoes that the damage
this afternoon was variously estimated

learned that nn area of 100 square miles
in one section of Saskatchewan and of
more than a million acres in the Dnko
tus and Minnesota had been swept by
two separate storms.
The Canadian damage was estimated
at five millions of dollars. Late re
ports this afternoon from . Crookston,
Minn., said dnmage to crops there would
run high into the millions, perhaps five
millions. From Fariro, N. D., it was
nid the damace in that vicinity would
be at least five millions of dollars and
perhaps eight millions.
The rusted and blighted wheat, turn
ed over under the hail, was battered

Washington, Aug. 4 Indications that
the Cnitcd States government is rapidly
formulating the course of action it will
pursue should the threatened railroad
strike materialize, were seen today in a
series of conferences between Presi
dent Wilson and Judge Chambers of the
United States board of mediation and
conciliation.
The question also was discussed at
length at the cabinet meeting.
Chambers held hi first conference at
the White House with the presideut at
9 o'clock.
Upon entering the conference he ex
pressed himself as optimistic over a
successful termination of the pending
difficulty. After talking with the presi
dent for hulf an hour, he prepared a
statement authorized by the president.
Before hp could give it out, however,
tho president called him on the tele
phone, requesting another conference.
At the conclusion of the second one,
it is believed, likely a statement outlin
ing the administration's position on the
strike situation will tie niaae eitner ar
the White House or at the United
Washington, Aug. 4. General Car
rnnza still insists that the first thing
to be decided by the United States anil
Mexico is tho withdrawal of the Amer
ican troops. -
Mexican Ambassador Arrcdondo to
day dolivcred to Acting Secretary of
State Polk a note, which, while nam
ing a commission and tacitly accepting
the latest American proposal for a
joint commission to investigate Mexican-American
relations, laid stress on
the fact that the Mexican commission
ers are "to devoto their attention pre
ferably to tho resolution of the poiut
mentiond in tho previous note of this
department."
The points referred to are the ques
tions of withdrawal of American troop
from Mexican soil, border patrol and
fixing of responsibility for border
raids. '
Washington officials agreed that
Cnrranza in this manner is indicating
his intention to urge these question
ahead of all others. '
No specific mentirn is made of any
broader issues to be discussed, although,
tho bvt American note particularly
pointed out that the adnilitistratiou
desires to go Into' ft larger,; discussion
of the Mexican problem than the pure
ly military phase,
Tho Mexican commissioners aTo ex
pected to arrivo .in. Washington in
about a week. Ignacio Bonilms" al-
ready is en route to this city. It ia
rumored that Atlantic City or Asbury
Park will be tho place of meeting.
No doubt has yet been expressed,
however, by state department offieinU
that tho Mexican conferees will show
a willingness to take up questions of
Mexican, finances and industrial de
velopment. On the other hand the note
implies tliat tlio connnisnionrs w
follow whatever lend is made by
American members as they have been
Instructed to devote their attention,
preferably to the military, problem.

Cities Outline Effect Of

In Many But Two Weeks
Now York Aug. 4. The United ganizations looking toward motor supply
(Continued on Page Five.)
Stntes would face one of the most se
rious food situations in decades if the
threatened strike of 400,000 railroad
men should materialize and become a
protracted fight, according to opinions
collected in a score of the larger cities
bv the United Press today. As the im
pending tie-up of 250,000 mileB of rail
road by the army of railway employes,
would be the greatest of all strikes, so
would tho resultunt loss and suffering
be the greatest, business men from
Coast to coust declared.
Coast cities and cities located on
navigable streams would be least affect
ed, according to the symposium of opin
ions. But they would be hard hit ncv-
ArlllAtoHH.
Babies and children would feel tne
brunt of such a strike. There would
obviously be great diifirulty iu supply
ing perishable foodstuffs to thickly
populated centers, even with water fa
cilities. Shortage of milk would be the
first felt, the opinions agree. Shortage
of other food stuffs would come ac
cording to how perishable they are, as
well as to supplies held in warehouses
and storase plants.
Home cities could net along after a
fashion for anywhere from two weeks
to a month, steps having already Deen
taken by city official and public -or-
trains that would scour outlying dis
tricts for foodstuffs. Philadelphia ia
one of these.
