By Associated Press.
New York. July 31. Charle E.
Hughe tonight outlined in hi speech
of acceotance the issues upon which
f he will conduct hit campaign for the
presidency.

a new p ilicy of "mrfiness and con
sistency toward Moxi'o for "tl.o un
flinching' maintenance of all American
rights on land and sea," and for ade
quate national defense adequtute p-o
tection on both our westren and cast
em coast.
Alien Intrigue.
"We denounce all plota and con 'pir
acies in the interest of any foreign
nation." Mr. Hughes said. "Utterly
intolerable in the une of our noil for
a alien intrigues. Every American must
I unreservedly condemn them and sup
port every effort for their suppres
sion." The nominee assailed the adminis
tration for its "direction of diplomat
ic intercourse" from the beginning, de
daring that where there should have
been conspiiuou strenirth and expert-
ness there had been weakness and in
expertness. Me cited Santo Domingo
an instance where appointments
had gone to "deserving Democrats"
and ta the failure to continued Am
bassador Henries; at his post in Paris
fur the war had started as "a la
mentable sacrifice of international rt
. pute."
f Faversj 8uf rate.
"I endorse the declaration in the
platform in favor of women suffrsire,"
Mr. Huzhes declared. And he added:
"Opposition may delay, but in my
judgment cannot defeat this movo
menU tavor the vote for women."
Trace the Mexican Situation.
One fourth of the speech was d" vot
ed to Ikrfxico. Step uf'er step taker. bv
- the administration with reference to
Mexici was assailed, from the days of
Huerta to the note sent the de fucto
Jovtrnment by the state department
une '3 la-t. part o fwhich wh.i tiuot.
d in the speech. The seizure of
Vera Iruiz, the nominee sail "was
war of course."
I.ater we retired from Vera Crux,
he continued, "giving up this noble
warfare. llecently the naked truth
was admitted by a cabinet officer. We
are now informed that we did not uo
. la Vera Crux to force Huerta to sa
lute the flag. We are told that we
went there to show Mexico thul we
were in earnest in our demand that
Huerta must go."
"America" Mr. Hughes continued,
"has no policy or aggression toward
Mexico, no desire for any part of her
territory, but wishes her to have peace
stability and prosperity.
Our Demands on Mexico.
"Thea conduct of the administration
has creiud difficulties we shell have
to surmount," he said. "WDe demand
p rom Mexico the protection of the
lives and property of our citizens and
the security of our border from de
predations." Brave Words No Acta.
Safeguarding American rights a
broad had not been accomplished by
the administration, he said. There had
been "brave words in a series of notes
but "what does it avail to use some
of the strongest words known to dip
lomacy if ambassadors can receive the
impression that the words are not tak
en seriously."
The nominee reitere ed his declara
tion (that this government left, no
doubt that it meant to hold Geimany
to '"strict accountability" there would
have been no loss of life on the Lusi-
tania.
" .Shockingly Unprepared.
Discussing preparedness Mr. II igne
said tt was appiircnt that the United
States was "shockingly unptcpiu i d."
"The administration has -failed to
discharge its responsibilities," Mi.
Hughes continued. "Apparently it is
' now seeking to meot poiiticul exigence
v by its navai program. Hut it has im
posed on the country an incompetent
navt.1 ndiiiinistratinn.
"We demand adequate protection on
both our western und eastern coast.
We dtimund thoroughness and c eic '..
cy in both arms of the service. It
seems to be plain that our regular
army is too small. We are too ureal
j a country to require nf our cition
f who are engaged in peaceful vocations
the sort of military service to which
they are now called.

in Pentonville jail, for high treason.
He was convicted of conspiring to
cause. an armed revolt in Ireland and
with having sought German aid to
that end.
Two hours before the execution, a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates. At
9 o'clock, the crowd had swollen to
such proportions that it extended for
two blocks from the prison front At
one minue after nine, a single stroke
of the big belt announced that the
trap had been sprang. It was the
signal for a mocking, jeering yell
from the crowd which suddenly died
away into doad silence.
Earlier in the morning, two priests
of the Roman Catholic church admin
istered the lust rites in the cell of the
condemned niun, and shortly after

clergymen, with Casement following,

yards away. As the party reached t'.e
shed wheie the gallows was erected
the special executioner, a hair dresses'
named Ellis, approached Casement
and quickly pinioned him.. Cnsement
mounted the gallo firmly and com
mended his spirit to God as he step

lever was pulled. Casement wus pro
pounced dcid at nine minute, after

i";eiution was in progress, was a

TWO TITANIC BLASTS Dl RING
EARLY MORNING HOIKS
DRIVE THOUSANDS
FROM RED.
Jersey City, July :s 1 . I was lit
erally jarred from bed when the first
of two titantic blasts occurred on
what is known as the Hlack Tom pen
insula, jutting out into the New York
Hay, at 2:lW Sunday nnvning. My
first thought was that a territk1 earth
quake had taken place.
Iluildtng were jarred and the shiv.
ered glas s windows- fell like ruin
Imps. I rockery rattled an. I gener
ally all tile efitcls of an s-atth.iuake
were fell.
Thousands dashed through the
streeU in their nikht clothe und
Biany stayed there for hours, hugging
the open space,, away fiom build in..
Door crashed inwunis and rot f
were ripped off, brii f chimney t ip

struck the tin roofs. Flames shot
two hundred yard in the uir and it
besan. I so light that the roosters be
gan to crow.
I reached the scene of the first ex
plosion in ten minutes. Soon ambu
lances put in an appearance and thea
the fire apparatus shuwed up.
Then came the second explosion and
the world seemed split open. Ear
drums seemed to collapse and pillar
of flame, surrounded by smoke, went
whirling skyward, whistling and whir
ring as shrapnel sped overhead.
I lay on the ground until the worst
was over.
There wer minor shocks a ex
plosions on nearby barges exploded.
At the ambulances the nurses calm
ly received the several injured men
brought to them by the policemen ar.d
gave them first aid treatment.
At dsswn the ground seemed like
an European battlefield The terrain
was mostly made land, built out over
the water of the bay.
The explosions of dynamite, lyditj.
dimite, nitro-celliilose, and gun pewd)

point of lund disappeared, (real steel
machinery was blown into bits.
The I i n are still dialing t .day.
The fiiemen are it work on the lire
Ion nog water fro'ui lifi streams of
lire hose. Occasionally a few dielW
explode.
The original ciiu.,e of the explosion
is ii mystery. Investigators found no
evidence of a bomb plot.
Four persons ure known to be do id,
twenty live ure mis ing and ll'i aro
injured. The propel I y loss probably
will reach liftv million dolรญais.
The fires or explosions destroyed 17
warehouses, six piers, four burge,, on

many of the latter laden with muni

today, their hearings then being post

Four persons ure known to huve
been killed An unidentified man win
found floating in the harbor, horribly

A serious aftermath of the explos
