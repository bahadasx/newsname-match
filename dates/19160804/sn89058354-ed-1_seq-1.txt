MANY THOUSAND FERTILE
ACRES TO BE RECLAIMED
THRU DRAINAGE PROJECT
Petition Filed to Drain Big
Sandy River Bottom from
Town of Big Sandy to Hollow
Rock Junction. Health Con
ditions Will Be Improved.
Many thousand fertile acres
along the Big Sandy river bottom
in Henry, Benton and Carroll
counties will be reclaimed as the
result of a bill filed in county
court this week by Lewis & Bry
ant and Fitzhugh & Morton, rep
resenting about fifty petitioners,
land owners, in the three coun
ties, seeking to drain the swamp
lands along the river from the
town of Big Sandy to Hollow
Rock Junction.
The petition will be increased
during-the next week by the ad
dition of probably 100 other land
owners.
The bottom along this river is
from one to two miles wide, run
ning a distance of 70 miles, and
containing thousands of acres of
landjin swamps, lagoons and
nmBhevnow almost valueless,
92n drained and reclaimed
wi the richest ' land Tn the
three counties, and prove oae of
the most productive bodies of
farm land to be found anywhere.
The draining of Big Sandy
river bottom will also mean the
destruction of millions of mos
quitos, and will be a great bene
fit to health conditions.
The counties of Weakley, Gib
son, Dyer and Madison have all
established drainage districts un
der the drainage law, and thou
sands of acres of land have been
redeemed, making the owners
rich.
The petitioners and attorneys
are being congratulated upon
their efforts to drain and reclaim
some of the most fertile land in
the state, and, what is of vast
more importance to humanity, to
destroy the malaria and improve
the health of the citizens along
the river. The river has been
obstructed by fallen trees and
drifts until a large rain would
result in the waters overflowing
the area of the entire surround
ing country.

M'KELLAR REPLIES TO
RYE PROPOSITION; HE
WILLSTANDBY PARTY
Nominee for Senator Declares
His Confidence In State
Executive Committee
GOVERNOR WOULD DISPLACE
HEADS OF PARTY IN STATE
McKellar Sends Message That
He Does Not Wish To
Dictate or Control
Replying to a proposition made
by Governor Rye through Dr. J.
D. McAlister that the three state
nominees McKellar, Rye and
Enloe name a campaign com
mittee to act apart from the
regular party organization, Con
gressman Kenneth D. McKellar,
nominee for United States Sena
tor, stated pointedly that he had
confidence in the Democratic
State Executive Committee and
its officials and that he did not
consider it his duty to select any
separate committee, or its chair
man, or dictate or control its or
ganization. He declined Gov
ernor Rye's proposition.
The proposition made by the
Governor grew out of the Gover
nor having, failed to control in
the election of a chairman of the
State Committee. The members
of the committee elected Judge
L. D. Hill, the present chairman,
for another term over Rye's op
position, although Hill success
fully managed the Rye campaign
two years ago. Since Judge Hill
was reelected the governor has
appeared '''peeved," and has in
timated that he might name a
separate committee to direct his
own campaign. In the mean
time, Judge Hill has opened Dem
ocratic headquarters at Nashville
and is organizing the state in the
interest of Wilson, McKellar,
Rye and the other nominees.
Now comes the governor's pro-
proposal to Congressman McKel-
ar that they, with Col. Enloe,
name a separate committee.
The proposal was submitted by
Dr. McAlister, and Congressman
McKellar's reply, which was
pointed and meets with the ap
proval of Democrats generally,
is as foilows:
July 27, 1916. Dear Dr. Mc
Alister; You have just handed
me the following proposition:.
That the three candidates,
Rye, McKellar and Enloe, select
their own campaign committee
outside of the state executive
committee, each member of the
campaign committee to be mu
tually agreeable to the candidate,
and the campaign committee to
select its own chairman and
secretary, who shall be mutually
agreeable to the three candi
dates. All other employes and
attaches to be selected in the
same way.
"This is handed me for the
first time on this morning about
11 o'clock, July 27.
"When you came to Washing'
ton last week to see me about
this matter you and I both went
over it at length, and I agreed
that we all ask the state execu
tive committee to appoint two
additional friends of Gov. Rye on
the campaign committee, ana

other suggestions that

BE UNVEILED IN FALL
Mrs. Alexander B. White Se
cures Funds For Monument
to Southern Soldiers
Since the announcement the
first week in July that the Shiloh
monument, located at Shiloh
national park, in Corinth, Missi,
a short distance from the Tennessee-Mississippi
state line, erect
ed to commemorate Southern
soldiers, will be unveiled in the
fall, and that ground has actually
been broken for it, and further,
that nearly all the $50,000 needed
to pay for the monument has
been secured, there has been a
bigrevival of interest manifested.
. There were doubtless many
who, realizing the difficulties
with which women secure funds,
thought it would be impossible
for them to finance such a large
undertaking, but it has been ac
complished by Mrs. Alexander B.
White, of Paris, Tenn., as director-general
of the Shiloh monu
ment fund, ably assisted by the
directions from each state having
charters of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy and other
loyal women who are desirous of
placing an enduring monument
to that body of Southern fight
ers whose unswerving loyalty
and remarkable efforts, made in
the face of gigantic ohstacles,
have made them at once the sur
prise and admiration of men and
women everywhere.
Mrs. White, who has charge of
the work, announces that contri
butions are still coming in, and
the few thousands of dollars need
ed to complete the $50,000 which
the monument will cost are ex
pected to be in by the time for
the unveiling if those who are
working for the cause continue
their vigil.
Just below the central group
of figures, which is in heroic size,
in which Death and Night are
snatching the laurel wreath from
Confederacy, will be a profile
head of Gen. Albert Sydney
Johnston in high relief. In order
to secure a good likeness of the
general, Mrs. White wrote to
Gen. Johnston's daughter, Mrs
Prichard, of San Francisco, who
furnished pictures of him.
you will recall, xou told me
that you would go ' to Nashville
and let me know. Yesterday
you returned, and told me that
the first suggestions were unsat
isfactory, and thereupon, after
again canvassing the matter
with you, I telegraphed Gov.
Rye as follows:
"Dr. McAlister here. It has
been suggested that state com
mittee ce urged to select Thad
Cox vice-chairman and he and
Judge Hill jointly run campaign.
Also executive committee select
from committee three of your
friends as additional men on
campaign committee. How does
this strike you? Wire answer;
"Last night I received the
following telegram from Gov.
Rye:

mit only proposition I care to
entertain."
This morning you handed me
the above quoted proposition as
coming from Governor Rye.
This proposition in effect ig
nores the entire party organiza
tion in the state, and no matter
what the intent may be its effect
would be to cast discredit upon
the state executive committee.
My reply to the proposition is,
that I am standing with, and am
going to continue to stand with,
the democratic state executive
committee in this and all other
matters over which it has juris
diction. "It is not my duty, or my
prerogative, as I conceive it, to
select any committee, or its
chairman, or dictate, or control
its organization. I am unwilling
to take any position or make any
agreement that ignores the dem
ocratic state executive committee
in the state or that might dis
credit the democratic organiza
tion in the state, and under no
circumstances would I be a party
to the creation of an independent
committee to be appointed with
out the authority and approval
Of the democratic state executive
committee. However, I am wil
ling now and at all times to do
anything, or agree to any plan,
that the state executive com
mittee authorizes.
'While I am perfectly willing
to go to any length to meet the
personal desires or wishos of any
other candidates, whatever their
desires may be, still, as a demo
crat I am unwilling to take any
steps, the effects of which might
be to bring the organization of
the party into disrepute, or
which might be regarded as an
assault on the- integrity of the
state committee. . I felt that I
went to extreme lengths yester
day morning when I agreed to
the suggestions, which I wired
Governor Rye, and which have
been quoted above. At all
events, I cannot agree to make
the recommendation asked for
about it. If this is desired I

Tharpe Is Far
In Lead; Next
Man Is Terry
Congressman T. W. Sims has
apparently been renominated
by a majority of about 900 votes
in the district, according to fig
ures given out by H. E. Graper,
of Lexington, Sims' manager,
about 10 o'clock Thursday night.
Dudley Porter carried Henry
county by about 1,000 majority,
and according to Mr. Graper's
figures had a majority of 27
votes in Benton county, with two
precincts out..
iSims, Mr. Graper stated, car
ried Carroll county by 476; Ches
ter 73; Decatur 138; Hardin 176;
Madison 310; Henderson 365;
McNairy 96; Perry 254.
Porter headquarters here re
fused to concede the nomination
to Congressman Sims at a late
hour last night.
Two years ago Congressman
Sims defeated Gen. B. J. How
ard, of Jackson, by 1,600 ma
jority. In the race for Representative
John C. Tharpe, of Cottage
Grove, led the field with a total
of 1137 in the eighteen districts
reported. R. M. Terry, of Pur
year, is second with 439; Thos.
J. Browning, of the old Second
has 340 and R. W. Lyon has 371.
As there are eight districts
yet to be heard from in this race
it is impossible to say whether
Terry, Browning or Lyon will be
in the run-off with Tharpe. If a
run-off is necessary it will be
held on August 19.
While returns are very incom
plete on the road bond election,
it is evident that the proposition
has been defeated by a large
vote. The Paris precinct gave
the bond issue a vote of about
two to one.
The constitutional convention
proposition has probably carried
the county by a safe majority.
For Trustee
According to reports received
at ten o'clock Thursday night
former Mayor E. H. Crump, of
Memphis, had been elected Trus
tee of Shelby county by a ma
jority of probably more than
1,000 votes over H. H. Litty.
Mike G. Tate, the Democratic
(Crump) candidate for Sheriff,
defeated W. J. Hayes candidate
of the Mooney-Fitzhugh-Monte-verde
faction, by about the same
vote and W. B. Weisiger won
out for Tax Assessor.
The Commercial-Appeal con
ceded the election of the entire
Crump ticket, it is said. .
