(Portland Eastern Argwf
A Few Words From Akers
I cannot say any more about
[roads—I have said much about
and either from that cause or
some more worthy one—our roads
have improved. Sô I will say a
few words about the men who
are now asking you to appoint
them as "most high observers'"
or "Big Boss of those same
roads"-as well as several other
important departments of county
business.
With all the msn who have filed
for this office at present writing,
I am personally acquainted, and
they are all fine men —very fine
men —especially Mr. Akers—of
course I must boost him —that's
what I am talking about.
Think this over—you are to
to have many candidates for com !
missioner -of which you must
choose two at the primaries !
Then choose a man for his quick, j
sure judgement in modern bust :
ness methods.
Choose a man who lives in the
"country" and knows its needs
and your wants.
Choose a man for his location
in the territory to be administer
ed to. (These commissioners dis
tricts are divided into three and
probably won't be changed and
Mr. Pepper's term holds over. )
Choose a man who wants the
job and has an honest claim to
your consideration.
Question, "The man for the
place?" Modestly I say to you,
both men and women:
adv Choose AKERS.

schools for the state department
of education, the Preston, West
more, Pugh, Lincoln, Baker,
Riley, Ekalaka, and Plevna
schools in Fallon county are now
wearing the name" plate bearing
the words, "Standard School"
which State Superintendent
Davee awards to all schools rec
ommended by their county super
intendendents.
Ehe score card by which these
schools are rated takes into con
sideration the building, the equip
ment, the grounds, the student
and community activities and the
work done by the school itself.
This makes it necessary for the
teachers, trustees, pupils, and
patrons of each school to work
together to make their school
what it ought to be and when
this cooperation has once been
secured, as a general rule, the
of the work has progressed most
rapidly.
