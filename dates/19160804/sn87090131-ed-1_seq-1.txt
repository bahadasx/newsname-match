THE BELLE OF BUTTERMERE.
A story from our own ground-the Maid
of Buttermere-
And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife k
Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came
And wooed the artless daughter of the
hills
And wedded her, in cruel mockery h
Of love and marriage bonds.
-Wordsworth.
In the year 1792 a wandering poet
blew into the celebrated lake district ai
of England. and put up at a humble
hostelry. When he called for a flagon N
of brown October ale, it was brought si
to him by Mary Robinson, the daugh- t
ter of the host; and Mary was a beau
tiful creature of fifteen years. Her p
form was slender and graceful, her
hair brown, waving and abundant, and n
her complexion perfect. The poet was S
so enchanted that he forgot to drink fc
his ale. He just sat there and ques- w
tioned her, and marked her gleaming t
white ted her shining brownn cruel mockery h
eyes, and made up his mind that there d
was nothing to compare with her in F
England. and put up at a umble
When he returned to the demnition d
grind in London, e wrote a piece fors brought t
his great find. At that time shepherd- t
esses and rustic maids were populara beau
with poets, and with the myriadsceful, her a
tried to be poets, and the magazine E
article stirred up great interest in
Mary of Buttermere. Most of the
bards headed for the lakes the next a
summer, when they took their vaca
tions, and returned enthusiastic. Mary d
lived up to the speciications in every
way. For eight years this sort of c
thing went on, and Mary became thefor t
Mecca of countless pilgrims. Poetsscribing
and artists were so common at ut- c
termere, and at Keswick a neighbor- ii

She Found a Bunch of Letters Addressed to Him and Signed by His Wife.
Ing town, that the housewife couldn't
throw out a pan of dishwater without
drenching a few of them.
It is greatly to the credit of Mary
that in the midst of all this adulation
and worship, she remained the modest,
simple girl she had been when ob
scure. At the age of twenty-three she
was unspoiled, although the most cel
ebrated beauty in the kingdom. It was
then that a gorgeous and glittering in
dividual arrived at Keswick. He was
of middle age, of fine presence and
handsome person, and his manners
were overpowering, in their old-school
majesty. He gave out that he was
Alexander Augustus Hope, brother to
the earl of Hopetoun, and now a mem
ber of parliament from Linlithgow
shire.
Now, in order to do justice to this
story, it would be necessary to write
a book of normal size; and it would
make such an interesting book that
somebody ought to write it. In such
a brief sketch as this, it is only pos
sible to hit the high spots, as it were,
and so the narrative loses those ele
ments of romance which have made it
an immortal folk tale in England.
The glittering stranger was accept.
ed at his own valuation by the people
of the lake country, with few excep
tions. Among the exceptions were
Coleridge and Wordsworth, who sized
him up as a faker and shook their
wise old heads gloomily whenever he
was mentioned. Hope explained that
he was taking a little vacation, and
traveling without servants because he
wanted to lead the simple life a while.
He made triends everywhere. Two of
those friends were a Mr. Crump and a
Colonel Moore. The latter was guar
dian to an Irish heiress, and was
greatly pleased when he observed that
the distinguished Hope was falling ir
love with her. Such a match was to
he greatly desired, and the eolodel e
couraged both the suitor and maid.
After a while the stately Mr. Hope
heard that there was good fishing over
at Buttermere. so he went there from
Keswick. and put up at the little inn.
And there he fell in love with Mary;
and there Mary. who had rejected
many suitors, ffll in love with him.
Some of the printed stories say that
Mary did not love him, and became
his bride through the insistence of her.,
parents, but this is not true. She was
fascinated by the handsome and dis
tinguished stranger, and was more
than willing to be his wife. So their
love affair progressed quietly at the
inn, and every now and then Hope,
went over to Keswick and professed
overwhelming affection for the Irish
heiress., so that Colonel Moore was
much encouraged.
One day Moore received a letter
from Hope, inclosing a draft for $150,
drawn on Mr. Crump of Liverpool,
which he asked him to cash. Hope
was called to Scotland on business,
and found himself short of cash.
Moore was pleased to receive such a
letter, as it showed that Hope looked
upon him as something closer than a
friend; so he sent Hope the money,
and added $50, so he'd be sure to have
plenty of change. Colonel Moore was
serene and contented all that day; the
next day he was stamping around and
frothing at the mouth, vowing all
kinds of foreign and domestic ven
geance. For the most astonishing
tidings had come to Keswick. Hope
had married Mary of Buttermerel It
is easy to understand the colonel's
wrath. The suitor of his ward had
borrowed money from him to marry
another girl!
Colonel Moore disguised himself as
Nemesis, and set forth to do what he
should have done in the beginning
to investigate the bridegroom's ante
cedents. He soon had reason to sus
pect that Hope was not a brother to
an earl, not a member of parliament
not even entitled to the name of Hope.
Such questions could be settled in a
few hours now. but in those days there
were no telegraphs, and investigation
was slow work. However, Moore made
such progress that he felt justified in
denouncing Hope as an impostor.
Hope was away on his honeymoon,
when he heard that he was being tra
duced in this way, and, filled with vir
tuous indignation, he returned to Kes
wick to face his accusers. The first
man he was requested to face was a
jurist who knew the Hope family well,
and this jurist, upon seeing the bride
groom, said: "I never saw this man
before."
Hope was given into the custody of
a constable, pending further investi
gations. He and the constable went
down to the shore of a lake, and Hope
got into a boat and rowed away, the
constable looking on. Hope kept on
rowing, and was seen at Keswick no
more. He still had the sympathy and
confidence of the entire community,
including his beautiful bride, until she,
t looking over some papers in an old
t desk of his, found a bunch of letters
addressed to him, and signed by his
wife. She learned that his real name
was Hadfield, and that he had a living
wife.
Her despair has been described by
so many poets that it is useless to try
to wrench your heartstrings now. And
it is easily imagined; cheated and de
serted while still a bride, it is no won
a der if Mary's beautiful cheeks became
i ghastly, if her starry eyes were red
3 and swollen in after days.
1 Hadfield was the greatest swindler
Sof his time, and had distinguished him
self in various criminal exploits of the
first magnitude. He was so adroit.
so Napoleonic in the matter of strat
egy, that he had always escaped seri
B ous punishment; but it was an evil
day for him when he stirred up Colonel
Moore. That implacable warrior could
t not be sidetracked. once his wheels
h were in motion. He found that the
draft he had cashed was a forgery,
and so he was equipped with a weapon
that meant doom for Hadfield.
t The recreant bridegroom was traced
all over England and Wales, and final
ly captured in an old coaching inn
e near Neath. Charged with forgery.
and with defrauding the post offce by
e franking letters as a member of par
d liament, he was convicted and sen
r tenced to death. Up to the last mo
e ment of his life he was debonair and
t fascinating, and even his jailers were
d enthusiastic in their admiration. Led
e forth to die, he beheld the rude scat
*. fold, and exclaimed, humorously:
f "Oh, happy sight! I see it with
a pleasure!"
No, Mary didn't die of a broken
s heart. In 1808 she was married to
t Richard Harrison, and reared a large
i family, and it is said that her daugh
o tern were as beastifl as she had beos
u- i her yeh.
