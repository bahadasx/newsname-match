McVILLE STRUCK BY
TERRIFIC TORNADO
Tolna and Territory Raked
by Cyclone—Many Build
ings Razed.
A series of wind, hall, rain and
electrical storms last night raked
Eastern North Dakota and North
western Minnesota, leaving a path of
damaged crops, over-turned buildings
and impassible highways. The crop
damage in various sections of the
state and Minnesota is enormous,
while hundreds of farm buildings
were demolished. No casualties occur
ed, although some injuries are report
ed.
Portland, N. D., suffered most from
hail. The hail storm cut a swath 15
miles wide and 20 miles long, level
ing the grain on 200,000 acres. It is
estimated that 300 square miles of
crops were entirely wiped out, re
ports from that section indicate. Hat
ton also was in the hail storm belt,
and the loss is said to be as great as
in the vicinity of Portland.
At Portland, hail fell for many min
utes. Some of the stones measured
over eight inches in circumference.
During the storm, a barn was struck
by lightning, and burned up.
.Tolna
(and
vicinity were swept by a
cyclone, which did estimated ..damage
•of »r0fl,t0'0 to 'buildings, most of
which were on farms. It is impossible
-.to estimate the damage done to crops.
Many head of stock were killed,
frhere are no reports of fatalities' or
Injuries.
A hail storm swept the territory
from Leeds, northeast through Gars
ke, toward 'Edmore, causing an im
mense loss. In the Garske region hail
fell for 40 minutes. Samuelson, Jorg
enson, Mikkleson, Kelly, Jones,
Kitsch, Keough and Began were in
the hail belt. Phone lines east of
Devils Lake are out of commission
today.
At Mohallf in Renville county, a
hail storm did 30 per cent damage to
the crops. The Lansford territory also
was visited by a bad hail storm.
Great Damage at McYille.
McVllIe and vicinity suffered more
damage than any of the other com
munities in this district, if not in the
entire section swept by the storm. Not
a single house escaped damage. At
least two persons were injured. The
storm dipped down from Aneta, lying
flat crops in the immediate vicinity.
The big barns on the farms of
Archie McMillan, J. J. Styve, Paul
Jacobson and O. H. Larson were com
pletely wrecked. The Lutheran church
[five miles south of McVille was de
stroyed. Granaries and small build
ings were carried long distances by
the terrific wind.
Horses and Cattle Killed.
On the farm of Ole K. Kjorbestad,
between Kloten and Aneta, the barn
was wrecked and 18 head of horses
and cattle were killed. In the city of
McVille, two livery barns and a ma
chine shed were demolished. The
store fronts of practically all the busi
ness places were blown in and wind
mills were tipped over.
It is reported that a total of fifty
horses were killed in the vicinity of
McVille, most of them by lightning.
The true extent of the damage in this
locality will not be known until tele
phone service Is restored, most lines
being down today.
The country to the northwest of
Grand Forks suffered heavily in the
storm. The region in which lie the
towns of Hatton, McVille, Northwood,
Reynolds and Thompson wais visited
by a storm which partook of the na
ture. of a tornado in part of the region
and was a heavy hail storm In other
portions.
Telephone service to Hatton, Rey
nolds and Thompson was disrupted
and these places could not be reached
over the long distance this afternoon.
Rural lines from Northwood were
down this morning and reports as to
the exact extent of the damage from
hail in that vicinity were not obtain
able. About seven miles east of town
the fields were flattened by hail and
wind. In the vicinity of Blanchard
the fields are reported completely
rased.
From Inkster, the report is that a
25 per cent loss was sustained south
of town in a hail shower which lasted
ifor 16 minutes. The wind did but
very little damage.

Tornado.
(Herald Special Service.)
Crookston, Minn., Aug. 4.—A tor
nado, with cyclonic outcroppings,
swept seven counties in the Red River
valley last night, doing enormous
damage to crops, farm buildings and
city property. The storm was the
most destructive and covered the
largest area of any ever experienced
in thl6 section.
In Crookston, the plate glass fronts
of the C. O. D. Clothing house, The
Golden Rule department store. Bray
& Halvorsen's department store, Ths
Slocum Francis Grocery store. The
Daily Times and stores of smaller
places, were blown in, signs were torn
4pwn, trees uprooted in Central park
and throughout the residence section
of the city, and a vast antountu«ijm-
nor damage'Was done.
.^In. the rural districts, the damage
tb farm- buildings was widespread. Big
cement block silos were destroyed,
barns turned over and outbuildings
scattered.
The Great Northern flyer from Win
nipeg ran into a barn which had been
•blown across the track, a distance
of half a mile from the John Bull
farm and cut it in two. The train was
delayed but a few minutes.
The crops between Crookston and
Grand Forks and north to the Cana
dian boundary through Northerp Nor
man, Polk. Marshall and Kittson
counties are as flat as though a steam
roller had passed over them. Por
tions of Pennington, Red Lake and
Roseau counties were hard hit.
Where the grain is not extremely
vigorous, it will not straighten up and
will be a thirty per cent or forty per
cent loss. Grain that is rusted badly
will be practically a total loss, as it is
broken off and crumpled up.
It is estimated that in the territory
referred to above, the damage from
the storm will run anywhere from
$5,000,000 to $10,000,000.
No loss of life has been reported,
but many sustained minor injuries
from flying glass.
Near Shelly, a strip a mile wide and
flve miles long was wiped out by hail.

FIRE CONDITIONS
BAD ON THE RANGE
Ely, Minn., Aug. 4.—According to
officials of the Superior national for
est service fire conditions are still
bad In this section. Five fires have
been put out and one is under con
trol and is being patrolled. Three
others are being fought with a crew
of 75 men.
One fire has burned over approxi
mately 4.000 acres and may cover a
considerably larger area before it is
controlled. It has been necessary to
take In men and supplies and tools
and camp equipment by canoe.
Forestry officials express gratifica
tion over co-operation with county
and city officials and a large lumber
company at Wlnto, which later has
furnished many of the men on the
fire line. It is expected that it will
take ten days more to control the
.fires now burning.

WIND MAKES RECORD.
According to records at the uni

last night had a velocity of 75 miles
for five minutes. During a minute
or two, the wind reached a higher
velocity, but only records for five
consecutive minutes are kept. The

Prof. H. E. Simpson, head of the
bureau, this afternoon described
the storm as a ''thunder storm
with a squall." There are slight
evidences that It reached tornadlo
effects, but the barometer showed
only a thunder storm.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Thursday
night, a terrific wind, rain and electri
cal storm passed over Grand Forks,
carrying away small buildings, trees,
fences and doing damage that will
amount to thousands of dollars. The.
storm resembled, a tornado, following
a p&th through the western section- of,
the city, and broadening In its scope
as it neared the north portion.
At the University of North Dakota

The damage to the house will
amount to over $1,000, it is estimated,
as the walls throughout the entire
building were ruined. Much of the
furniture was damaged by water. The
roof landed in a grain field northeast
of the house. The electric light wires
in that vicinity were torn from the
poles and sputtered on the ground
until late this morning. Several teams
passed over the wires, unaware that
several hundred electrical- volts were
passing through them, but no injuries
were reported.
The path of the storm led over to
the baseball park where the. bleach
ers were blown over and demolished.
Stretches of fence over 60 yards in
breadth were 'blown' over on the east
and north end of the grounds.
House Lifted From Foundation.
The R. Mitchell house, located near
the ball park, was lifted over flve feet
into the air and deposited several feet
from Its foundation. Mr- and Mrs.
Mitchell and two children were in the
house at the time, but were uninjured.
The house was not badly damaged
and only one large front window was
broken by the velocity of the wind.
The Pete Gannaw barn at 1207
Dell avenue was demolished, and the
structure located at the rear of the
John Sharon home at 1211 Dell ave
nue, was torn into bits and strewn
for over a distance of a block.
Throughout other sections of the
city, outhouses were blown down and
fences were destroyed. Many of the
streets of the city were strewn with
trees and it was necessary to clear
a passage for teams and cars early
this morning.
In the rural districts, thousands of
dollars in damages resulted. Silos
were blown down, roofs of barns and
chicken coops were lifted bodily from
their moorings and hurled distances of
hundreds of feet through the air. On
the J. D. Bacon farm, operated by Mr.
•Patterson, a new concrete silo was
demolished and considerable damage
was done to other buildings.
Barn Roof Blown Away.
On ths International Harvester
company farm, near the University of
North Dakota, the roof of the brick
tern was torn away and carried by
th© wind through the air, over a
chicken house and corn crib and de
posited on a wagon. Eleven alfalfa
stacks were strewn over a large ter
ritory and the corn and grain were
oeaten to the earth.
In every section of-the county visit*

(Captain^ ^ptisch, of War
bound German Liner,
Tells
of
Escape.
Norfolk, Aug: 4^—That the' Deutsch
land has entilrej^ escaped the observa
tion of the allied naval "war-dogs,"
waiting beyondl'the Virginia Capes,
and is now speeding toward her home
port, is the' belief in general shipping
circles here today- Nothing has been
heard of the under-sea craft since she
glided into the^epths of the Atlantic
36 hours ago, Sparing a cargo of
mi?ch-needed supplies for Germany.
There is no indication when the ex
pected sister-iubmersible Bremen,
will make hjer long heralded arrival.
Captain Hinsch of the war-bound
German liner Neckar, who'' on board
the tug Thomas F. Timmins, directed
the departure of the Eieutschland,
said that the' under-water freighter
passed unobserved within one hun
dred yards of a United States destroy
er on neutrality duty about a mile off
the capes. He also disclosed that the
submarine submerged twice on her
way down the bay. to test her engines
"When we came to a stop at a
point in the bay which I shall not dis
close because we probably shall have
to use the place again," said Captain
Hinsch, "the. pilot aboard the sub
marine was taken off to the Timmins.
It was then about 5 o'clock in the
morning. The submarine was sub
merged, so that her machinery and
pumps could be tested and the cargo
trimmed should, that be necessary.
She went down in a deep hole in the
bay to a depth of .one hundred and
thirty-flve feet, remaining there for
some time.
"When she cams, to the surface
again, Captain Koenig came up
through the connlhg tower and said
that everything .was working perfect
ly. We started off down.the bay, and
Whsn *o trarS&fVas in eight the
Deutschland t«*» another dive while
running. Shs,miii down until only
fpur inches t-=©T "her 'periscope was
Bhowirtg above ths water. Then I
dropped /behind to see at what dis
tance: the wake of the Deutschlahd or
the foam crest of the periscope "could
be seen- At four hundred yards with
glasses I could not see a thing.
"The tests having proved that the
Deutschland was in perfect condition,
we went Into a place to hide for a
while. We were well hidden, too.
Anyone would have had great diffi
culty In finding us.
"In the afternoon we started for the
capes and. you know how the better
part of the trip was made. The de
stroyers were passed in the dark. As
soon as the men on the bridge sight
ed the lights of the Timmins they
watched us closely and looked all
around for the submarine, which
passed them at a distance of only a
hundred yards. At the time the sub
marine. was submerged until her
decks were awash.
"Later, when I reported to the de
stroyer that the Deutschland had
cleared the capes and was on her way
to sea, the officers aboard seemed
much surprised. They had not ob
served her at all. So you see that the
British and French cruisers off shore
hadn't the slightest chance of finding
the Deutschland."
Captain Hinsch added that after
the officers and members of the crew
had given three cheers for America,
he heard Captain Koenig give the or
der "diving stations" at that time the
vessel's were about a mile off the
capes. The submarine increased her
speed and the men aboard the Tim
mins,, which had stopped, watched
her and she sped for the open sea
A mile away all her lights suddenly
disappeared.
Captain Hinsch said he knew the
vessel submerged at that time when a
mile inside 'the three mile limit.'
He added it would be unwise for
him to disclose whether the vessel
went up or down the coast before
striking out to sea or whether she
steered an easterly course straight
out.
Captain Hinsch returned to Balti
more, leaving the Timmins in Norfolk
with instructions to pick up a tow
for Baltimore if one could be secured
within a day or two. If no tow is
Available, the tug. he said, will go
back to Baltimore anyhow.
In response to questions regarding
the prospects of the Bremen.- sister
ship to ths Deutschland, arriving in
American waters. Captain Hinsch
said:
"You can depend on it that if the
Bremen was coming In the near fu
ture I would not be returning to
Baltimore and neither would the
Timmins. He declined to say when
the Bremen was expected.

Teutons Less and Less Cap
able of Maintaining Pace,
Leaders Believe.
Paris. Aug. 4.—Attacking simul
taneously from the northwest and
southwest, the French yesterday
stormed the village of Fleury. three
miles north of Verdun and captured
several hundred Germans.
In the evening, however, the Ger
mans launched a furious counter-at
tack and, after several violent at
tempts,. succeeded in getting a foot
ing in the southern part of the village.
The. French today continue to hold
the northwestern section of the place,
with heavy fighting progressing.
Verdun again is the center of the
war stage. The recapture of a part of
Fleury, which was held by the Ger
mans for over a month, caused great
elation in France. It is the first fruit
of the French slow, methodical offen
sive, begun three days'ago, and seems,
in the opinion of French military ob
servers, to mark an epoch in the six
months' battle for the great fortress.
The Germans appear to be less and
less capable of operating on their old
overwhelming scale, and the Initiative
is about to pass to the French for
good, the observers think.
Germans Say Village is Retaken.
Berlin, Aug. 4—The village of Fleu
ry was regained by the Germans this
Morning,- it was officially announced.
Ths situation at Fleury and vicini

same as before the French attack.
Austro-German troops regained all
of ths territory they had lost in the
region of. Rudka-Mirynskaia, east of

the Teutons also gained ground in the

On the right bank of tl^e river
Mouse, the battle continues along the
front from Thlaumont to Fleury, the
Germans attacking several times dur

Briefly, the French entered the

COMBINATION OF
CAUSES BRINGS
AfiOMLOSS
Situation Bears Out Predic
tions of the Most
Pessimistic.
RED AND BLACK
RUST WIDESPREAD
Heavy Damage by Blight
Adds to Losses—Corn
is Fine.
A poll of the leading bankers of
Northwestern North Dakota this
morning, in an effort to ascertain the
extent to which the rumors of crop
damage by rust are true, reveals a
situation which confirms the predic
tions of the most pessimistic. Were
an average opinion to be struck, it
would probably place the damage to
the wheat crop at at least 50 per
cent. Other crops are not quite so
badly hurt, but it seems to be the pre
vailing opinion among the farmers
that the early crops, such as barley,
will In many instances scarcely repay
the cutting.
There seems to be a combination of
causes which is responsible for the
enormous damage to the wheat crop.
Red and black rust in all stages of
development seems to be more wide
spread than at any other time. At
points to the north of Grand Forks,
old settlers do not hesitate to place
the damage from this cause greater
than at any previous time, not ex
cepting 1910.
Loss by Blight.
In conjunction with the rust, there
has been heavy loss by blight, this
dread disease attacking the top of ths
plant while the rust attacks the stem.
The exceedingly hot wave which
struck this country at the time the
whole nation was sweltering, left its
mark on the wheat fields in forcing
the grain to early maturity.
Durum wheat is reported in mors
satisfactory condition than bluestem
or velvet chaff. Other small grains
have also, up to the present time, es
caped extensive damage from rust,
but the excessive heat seems to have
blistered much of the grain which was
farthest advanced to maturity. Winter
rye is reported to be a good crop
wherever it was planted. Potatoes are
not as good a crop as usual. Most re
ports place this crop among the dis
appointments of the season.
The corn crop this year is fair, but
not as many acres have been put in
as in former years. The stalks are
healthy and are growing vigorously
although the lateness of the spring
considerably delayed this crop.
Rain Will Help Some.
Wherever the rain of last night was
not accompanied with a high wind or
hail, reports state that much benefit
will be derived from the thorough
soaking, provided that good weather
follows. The statements of the men
closest to the financial needs of the
sections to which this morning's in-:
quiry reached, indicate that the loan
market in the regions affected will bs,
active this fail and winter, but that!
there is no particular cause for anxie
ty-
The statements of the bankers fol
low:
C. H. Simpson of McVlUe: "The
crops in this locality are badly dam
aged by rust. The yield would have
been 50 per cent or less than average,
from this cause, but the storm of last
evening has greatly increasod this.
The corn crop is very good. Early
barley was good but is now badly:
lodged."
A. S. Elllngson of Northwood: "The!
damage to crops in the neighborhood
of Northwood from rust and blight la
so extensive that many farmers ques
tion whether the grain will be worth
in a in a a
last evening has done still further
damage. Wheat near Blabon is re
ported to promise a grade of "rejected'
and to run 6 or 7 bushels to ths acre.
Corn, oats and barley are good. Of
the wheats, velvet ohafl Is least affect
ed."
A. P. Lord of Larimore: "Although
there is no blight reported here, ths
damage from rust is enormoua Ons
farmer plaoes the loss at 70 per cent.
Corn is late and potatoes are showing
luxuriant tops but will not yisld very
well. The barley crop will be good."
C. H. Cruttenden: "Wheat will
yield about a half orop. In this locali
ty. Durum whsat Is good, and corn
is doing nioely. Ths potato crop prom
ises to be light. Harvesting Is just
commencing hers. Ths crop outlook
promises many loans by farmers this
fall."
Ray Stong of Drayton: "The loss
from rust will be about CO or TO psr
cent. Corn and oats are fair. Har
vesting has been going on for a cou
pis of days."
C. J. Lord of Cando: "Rust and
blight have attacked whsat to an ex
tent which Indicates a loss of about
60 per cent. The past three wseks
have been disastrous Durum seems
to be escaping to a considerable sat
tent Potatoes, corn and barley are
