THE FUTURE
THE UNITED STATES, now enjoying the greatest prosperity in its his
tory, is assured even greater—and permanent—prosperity in the future.
This is the incontrovertible opinion of leading and unbiased economists
in the country.
In March, 1016, the resources of our national banks in the United States
were 5t4,383,000,000.
This sum exceeds by 5370,000,000 the greatest resources ever known 411
the history of the national banking system.
It exceeds bv approximately three billions the combined resources of
the Bank of England, Bank of France. Bank of Russia, Reichsbank of Ger
many, Bank of the Netherlands, Swiss National Bank, and Bank of Japan.
And in March, 1916, the resources were S2.27t.iHX) greater than in
March. The future will present even larger resources.
Scant attention need be paid to prejudiced alarmists who, for political
or other selfish reasons, predict a period of depression after the war.
When peace comes, the commerce of the United States will be far
sweater than during the war. It will be the greatest in all of its history, and
may be greater than that of any country in ALL history.
These impregnable facts bear out the promise of greater prosperity in
the future:
I—The percentage of war orders, contrasted with the entire domestic
and fprei gn commerce of the United States, is small.
2—When peace comes, we shall receive even greater orders from Europe
for the restorative purposes of peace, for the reconstruction of ruined in
dustries and cities.
3—We shall regain our trade with Germany and Austria, which
amounted to $367,500,000 the lest year prior to the war. ■*- — -
4—We shall have less competition than in the past from England,
France and Germany, our hitherto greatest commercial rivals. The belliger
ent nations will have to raise, by taxation, the enormous interest on wsr
debts. TAXATION ADDS TO THE COST OF PRODUCTION. Hence,
they cannot undersell us. Many of their skilled workmen have been lost.
Many of their industries have been destroyed. Other difficulties, such ss
impaired credit, weaken their power of competition.
s—The great markets of South and Central America, Australia, and a
new Russia with a keener need and desire for development, will be open to
American enterprise. They have been seeking us in the past two years.
They will need us more than ever.
THE WHOLE WORLD. IN FACT. IS THRUSTING OPPORTUN
ITY AT THE DOOR OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT WILL OFFER US EVEN MORE IN PEACE THAN IN WAR
VASTLY MORE.
NEW MARKETS. THUS GAINED, WILL BE OURS TO KEEP.
THE PROSPERITY OF THE FIXTURE IN THE UNITED STATES IS
INFALLIBLE, SECURE, PERMANENT.

He was my first surprise of the
afterti' on I h.vl always imagined
a chief of police would be stern
*nd *ery cold, and Mr Becking
ham ia neither of tbeM thing* He
laughs a great d'sl, and la bovli.h
without losing dignity nor firm
ne«s. The only thing that kept
my Ideal from nhsoliile wreck w*s
the fact that he chewed a fat black
cigar with one side <»f his mouth
and talk'd with the > other, 'hvs
'resting a delightful uncertainty In
the mind of his hearer as to wnat
he might have ipla.
I went with him from the may
or's office to the Public Safety
ilulidlng. and It pleased me to have
the |M>lt< a men salute so i>olltely as
w<- passed. I took it quite person
ally until I discovered after I had
left the chief in his office that they
dldn I do it any more.
Chief Is Privileged
We went in thru the basement
where the automobiles and the
prisonera and everything go In.
There Is one big curving road
where on<- Is supposed to «" ' n
and another where one Is supposed
to come out. snd *e went In. to my
horrow-, where we were supposed
to come out. Chief Hecktngham
sppsrentlr thought nothing of It
tho. and we arrlted at the elevator
safely.
On the street floor we stopped
and went Into a series of halls that
lead ultimately, if one is only pa
tient. to the offices of the chief
of police.
In lbe first hall there Is a huge
wind?* directly facing the elevat
or Thru It I saw several brass
buttoned persons strolling sbout.
One stei%ed to the window as the
elevator stopped and regarded me
suspiciously until he saw the chief.
Then he smiled and withdrew.
Thought Her a Prisoner
"lie thought someone was com
Ingiin." the chief told me from the
clgarless corner of his mouth.
"They frisk em here, you Know."
I didn't know, and showed It.
"Search them." he elucidated
Remove whatever they have In
their pockets and put It away.
Also they take the name, age.
"eight and height of the person ar
rested. and the time of the arrest
and the reason."
We hurried on thru a maze of
halls and small offices. It must
keep the detective instincts of the
