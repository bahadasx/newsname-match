All
Important Court Decision
Last Saturday Judge Sapp in
superior court rendered a deci
sion in a case that had been in
court for nearly two years. This
is the case of the Snowflake
Taylor Irrigation Company
against the Navajo-Apache Bank
& Trust Co., and involved the use
of water in Ortega lake.
By the terms of the decree
made by Judge Sapp the defen
dant corporation is permitted to
maintain a dam in the lake simi
lar to the one in use prior to the
filing of the suit in 1914. In other
words, the conditions existing
prior to the commencement of the
suit by the plaintiff corporation,
which were evidently satisfac
tory to both parties, are restored.
This is one of the cases in
which the court decree is based
on justice and equity to both
parties; it is satisfactory to the
attorneys for the two litigants
and will no doubt be satisfactory
to the principals.
Attorney C. H. Jordan repre
sented the plaintiff and Attorney
F. W. Nelson the defendant.
Bond Election Called
In another column of the News
appears the notice of a bond
election which has been called
for Tuesday, August 22, by the
school trustees of the Holbrook
district. This election has been
called for the purpose of secur
ing additional funds to complete
and equip the new school build
ing, a contract for the construc
tion of which was let last week.
It is the intention of the
trustees to use the $8000, if vot
ed by the taxpayers of the dis
trict, in finishing the building
in accordance with the original
plans; in improving the grounds
about the building, and possibly
purchasing a playground, and in
furnishing new equipment for
use in the various departments.
The action of the school board
in calling an election to vote
more bonds is the only possible
way in which adequate school
facilities can be secured. To con
struct such a building sufficient
funds are not available; hence
more money must be secured,
and a bond issue in the best way
to secure it.
The Railroad Strike
The referendum vote on the
proposed railroad strike came to
a close last Monday. The result
of the vote, while not yet offi
cially announced, is understood
to have been practically unani
mous in favor of conferring upon
the official board of the railway
workers powers to call a strike.
The consequence will be that
at the next conference of railway
managers and chiefs of the
brotherhoods, the latter will be
armed with the authority to de
clare a strike. The grave ques
tion is whether they will exercise
that authority. Evidently their
belief is that if they have such
authority, the railway managers,
knowing it. will grant conces
sions rather than run the risks of
a strike of important employes.
The managers have offered to
submit the differences to arbitra
tion and arbitration probaoly will
be the outcome of the confer
ence. Certainly the brotherhood
officials will hesitate long before
they would plunge the country
into a great strike the results of
which no man could predict. The
brotherhood chieftains, if the
Strike rule-wins, will be clothed
with grave responsibility.
Lfuer Trouble
"I am bothered with liver
trouble about twice a year,"
writes Joe Dingman, Webster
City, Iowa. "I have pains in my
side and back and an awful sore
ness in my stomach. I heard of
Chamberlain's tablets and tried
them. By the time I had used
half a bottle of them I was feel
ing fine and had no signs of
pah." Obtainable everywhere.
Burglar Robs Pool Hall
The pool hall and barber shop
owned by James Armstrong at
Winslow was burglarized some
time earlv Friday morning and
over $200 in twenty, ten and five
dollar gold pieces were taken
from a punch board, which had
not been put in the safe for the
night.
The officers think it probable
that it was some one who knew
that the punch boards were not
locked up for the night, and took
advantage of their knowledge of
the place, it being a very popular
one for the male population of
Winslow.
Judge Edward Kent Dead
Judge Edward Kent of Phoenix
died Sunday morning at Chicago
of pneumonia. As a delegate
from this state he attended the
republican national convention,
after which he went to Boston to
participate in the annual cere
monies of his class at Harvard.
He was returning to Phoenix
when he was seized. Judge Kent
was a son of Covernor Kent of
Maine. He was 54 years of age.
He was chief justice of the su
preme court of Arizona from
1902 to the admission of state
hoodin 1912.
New Undersheriff Arrives
A nine pound boy baby was
born to Mr. and Mrs. W. G.
Clemons early Wednesday morn
ing. Mother and child are doing
nicely, but the father is in a
serious condition, according to
the judgment of friends. He
insists that his son is a prodigy;
that no such infant was ever
born until this one arrived, and
that in a few months at most,
the youngster will be competent
to attend to all the duties of the
undersheriff's office.
Some of Undersheriff demons'
friends are hoping that he is
correct in his opinion of his son's
prowess, and should such be the
case they will insist that the
first official act performed by the
youngster be the incarceration of
his father in a padded cell.
Auto Party Start for Utah
Judge Geo. Crosby and Jno. T.
Patterson, each driving his own
car, left Thursday for Salt Lake
City. They took with them the

E. Wiltbank, Mrs. David Butler

terson expects to remain two or
three months and take treatment
in the L. D. S- hospital for hay
fever and catarrh, with which
he has been almost prostrated
during the past month, being un
able to scarcely see or breathe
at times. Judge Crosby expects
to be away about a month. St.

Sheepherders Killed by Lightning
Two Mexican sheepherders
were killed by lightning some
time last Saturday afternoon in
their tent, about 8 miles south
west of Dry Lake. The names
of the men are Cipriano Már
quez and Altofo Nuanes; they
were employed by Frank God
dard, and when killed were in
charge of a flock of Goddard's
sheep.
The bodies of the men were
discovered Monday morning by
the owner and word was brought
to Holbrook Tuesday morning.
Judge Boyer, ex-officio coroner,
summoned a jury of six men
and, accomponied by Sheriff
Newman, repaired to the scene.
The dead men were found in
their tent where they had sought
shelter from the storm. Their
bodies were in such shape that
they could not be moved. The
verdict of the jury was in ac
cordance with the aboye stated
facts. The bodies were after
wards buried in a shallow grave
close to where they had been
found. The homes of the two
men are thought to be near
Albuquerque, and Judge Boyer
will make an effort to in
form their friends of their
deaths.

Train Wreck on Canyon Line
Fred Terry, fireman, was kill
ed; John Oswald, engineer, was
slightly injured, and Will
Havens, head brakeman, sustain
ed two broken ribs, when a pas
senger train on the Grand Can
yon railroad was wrecked thirty
miles from the Grand Canyon at
9:15 o'clock Saturday night.
The train had left the canyon
for Williams at 7:40 Saturday
evening, and was traveling at a
low rate of speed of eight miles
an hour, the engineer realizing
that there was great danger of a
softened track because of a se
vere cloudburst.
As the train approached a
bridge over a small wash about
eight miles south of Willaha, the
engineer saw the stream was
running full and there was great
danger and as the engine rolled
up to the bridge he applied the
brakes. But it was too late
and the bridge caved in taking
the engine and baggage car
down with it. Luckily non) of
the other cars, which contained,
sixty passengers, were derailed.

Just the Thing for Diarrhoea
"About two years ago I had a
severe attack of diarrhoea which
lasted over a week," writes W.
C. Jones, Buford, N. D. "I be
came so weak that I could not
stand upright. A druggist

ic, cholera and diarrhoea remedy.
The first dose relieved me and
within two days I was as well as
ever." Many druggists recom
mend this remedy because they
know that it is reliable. Obtain
