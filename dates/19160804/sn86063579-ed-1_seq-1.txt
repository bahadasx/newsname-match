"If Mayor Kordbaus of Deming
ver comes to Delaware, he can
elaim any part of the state he wants,"
remarked an enthusiastic officer of
ths Delaware regiments, hs wss say
ing complimentary things concerning
the Harvey House dinner, tendered
the officers of the Delaware Nation
al Guard, Sunday evening.
And that seems to be abont the ex?
pression of all the contingent froiu
our tiny little state on the Atlantic
coast.
It was certainly a happy thought
on the part of Mayor Nordhaus to
invited the officers of Camp Deming
and the officers who earns from Del
iiwnrc, to one of the most delightful
get -acquainted functions of our pres
ent military operations. The- affair
was wholly Informal, hut has left a
taste in the mouth of our friends
from the East, that will always he
a morsel of sweet savor.
Immediately after the dinner there
was one of the happiost extempnnn
nneous programs that could be Imag
ined, ths happy part being the heart -felt
expression on the part of our
distinguished guests.
At the request of the host, the edit
itor of the Graphic was asked to pre
side as tonstmastcr snd it is a very
certain thing, that no more geuuino
response Vive been heard along the
border, The first to deftght tlTc dim-re
was Major J. Waruer Reed, senior
commanding officer, who said that
they had been in the Delaware ramp
thirty-five days, and that twenty-two
of them hnd been rainy. He compli
mented our ntntehlrss Deming eliinnte
and was much gratified for the ver
kind reception given his soldiers
Major Htritxingcr, camp rommi-iid-er,
expressed bis gratification at tv
excellent work done by the Deming
citixens, and complimented the Del

work of pitching their tenU. ,

Major TV. E. Lank, cmmu.tnder of
the second battalion of the Delaware
troops, exprosed the opinion tht
his state was the luckiest !i'ncti thus
far that has come to the border 1 ft ;
complimented our pure air, Hid '. I
that Delaware soldiers would btlinxe
themselves like gentlemen.
Lieutenant Chas. R. Jefferis ex
pressed liy--great pleasure at the
cordial welcome extended by IVming
to himself and associates.
Lieutenant Bush, who, by the way,
is one of the prominent business men
of his state, was very, very much
pleased with the royal reception ac
corded these Dclnwarinns.
Captain James W. Cannon reninrk

Major Wiu. Marshall said he was

"When Bush puts anything over,
it is ss good aa it can be," remark
ed i gentleman, following the very
elaborate banquet given by our high
ly respected townsman, Mr. H. G.
Rush, to tha officers of Camp Dem
ittg, Wednesday evening.
This statement waa fully verfied
by ths dinner given by Mr. Bush,
which will go down in social history
as one ths most elaborate 10-cour s
banquets ever given at the local ho.
tel. For two hours Mr. Bush and his
guests regaled themselves on the
best food that could be prepared, and
it is certain that the Harvey Housn
people know bow to do the preparing.
when they have an order, as they hnd
in this case, to go the limit, regard
less of expense.
The host, seated between Major
Stritxeinger and Major Reed, occu
pied the head of the table. Ths foot
f the table being occupied by Maj
or Weed, Major Lank aud the toast
master. Captains, lieutenants, and
private citixeu graciously filled in
the side lines.

It was certainly an inspiring gath
ering; and one that will he very diffi
cult to duplicate.
Following the delectable dinner, the
service of which could not be improv
ed upon, Manager Morsbead being
M-rsonnlly assisted in the entertain
ment of the party, by Mr.'J. S. Bay
lis of the Hnrvcy system, the host
iiiinic a nent little sieefh welcoming
the quests, after which the Graphic
editor look charge of the after-din-ncr
oratory. And it was surely some
oratory. Major Slritzinicer said some
as nice things as English language
can conceive, and gave u most glow,
ing tribute to Brigadier General
Granger Adams, designated by the
war department to nnme command
of camp Deming.
Major Reed wittingly remarked
that Deming had already secured a
very strong "Iloll" on Delaware, and
that every one of the hoys from the
commanding officers to the young
men who work in the "trenches,' are
delighted to be with us.
Major tank said that Deming was
living up to even more than its repu
tation for hospitality. He paid a
very tine tribute to Major Stritiing
er, and it was very noticeable thst
whenever the camp qnartermster's
iiuuie was mentioned, the entire
body broke forth in cheers.
Lieutenant Tomilson followed Maj
or tank, and again charmed his hear
era by railing Deming the "Glory
Spot" of the U. S. A. Lieutenant
Tomilson has certainly made a hit
with his after-dinner talks.
Captain Ellison assured his Demin;
friends thst should any of them ever
come to Delaware that nothing would
be spared to reciprocate for the hos
pitality shown here.
Lieutenant J. D. Bush, who by the
way, is one of the big lumbermen of
the east.delighted his hescrs in his
speech, eulogising the hospitality of
Deming, and the real joy of being
with us. He spoke in glowing terms
of his little state, and was accorded
very generous applause.

tenaat, non-commissioned officers
and tha bast bunch 'of national
guardsmen that baa soma to ths bord
er.
Two battalions of Delaware nation,
si guardsman arrived at the Union
Station early Sunday morning and .
the reception given them by Major
Stritiinger of Camp Deming, Mayor
Nordhaus and the leading eititens of
Deming, made them think they were
just stepping off a train in their home
town. It is wonderfully easy to aa
that no finer bunch of guardsmen will
be brought to this or any other point.
At least two hundred of the bunch
are employees of the DuPont Powder
Works at Wilmington, and it is a
pleasant fact to know that this great
establishment keeps up the wages of
men of their employ when the govern,
ment pay is less than the regular pay
given them by the company.
Soon after the arrival of the troops
the Kelly-Springfield trucks convey
ed the equipment to Camp Demiug,
where the Red Cross served a fine.
luncheon, the Williams Girl's Band
furnishing insiuring music meanwhile.
Good cheer, at once dispelled all the
uttle glooms and it is aafs to say
that no gloom will stick its head above
ground in the Delaware part of Camp
