Second Regiment has Been Drilled Into
Good Shape and is Eeager
' for Border Service
(Special Correspondence of the Star)
Black Point, Aug. 3-The boys are
all eagerly awaiting orders to entrain
for the border. Every day sees the
men in better shape and all are work
ing hard with the expectation of
eaving soon for the border.
Besides being soldiers the boys did
"movie"' act ; Saturday. The regi
ment marched out in heavy marching
order and was photographed in line
of column and ' tnen pulled a regi
mental parade. .
Quite a few of the men not qualify
ing who made fairly, good" scores are
being given another chance to make
good. AH the boys should be given a
chance.
The machine gun men who have
divided among different , companies
have assembled and tented . on the
river. .

sent out to try and get enough men to
bring the regiment up to war
strength.

ORDERS HAVE NOT ARRIVED
Second Regiment, However, Continues
to Improve in Efficiency
(Times-Union)
Officers in authority at state camp,
where the Second Florida Infantry is
mobilized, are still without the slight
est information as to when the regi
ment will move to the Mexican border.
No troops have moved to the border
since the war department some weeks
ago announced that no more would be?
sent until they had been thoroughly
equipped. The Florida regiment is still
short some equipment, which is abso
lutely necessary to its needs in the
boMer country.
In the meantime the unit is going
ahead piling up efficiency, and when it
does get to the border, which many
believe will eventually be the case, it
is going to make a whole lot of people
down there sit up and take notice.
The battalions are daily on the road
for practice marches, or at work
mastering the intricacies of extended
order drill, or ort the rifle range ac
quiring proficiency in the use of the
small arm. . '
The commands progress is ; now
very noticeable, and when it turns out
for parade or drill it has the bearing
and swing of a regular regiment.
; The officers and men will soon have
another- pay day a full month this
time, and of course, the event is be
ing anticipated with pleasure. In fact,
pay is past due, and it is believed
that the reason the disbursing officer
has" not been around before is that the
war. department is waiting the pleas
ure of Congress, in getting through
the army appropriation billr which has
been tied up in conference for some
time. Uncle Sam is good, however,
for anything he owes, and there is
no uneasiness m camp.-

PERMANENT ROADS ; -
AND BOND ISSUES
Here are - some points on perma
nent roads and road bond issue taken
from the United States department
of agriculture's bulletin on "Highway
Bonds," as compiled by Laurence S.
Hewes, chief, economics and mainte
nance, office of public roads, and Jas.
W Glover, professor of mathematics
and, insurance, University of .- Michi
gan, collaborator officer, of public
roads:
Frem the standpoint of public econ
omy the annual cost of hauling repre
sents the operating expenses of . the
load system. The direct return upon
the highway, then, is the reduction in
operating expenses. 'The difference
between the old hauling costs and the
hauling costs over the improved roads
is a real saving to the community.
The unit in which hauling costs are
measured is the ton-mile. The cost of
hauling a ton one mile on a poor road
probably varies on an average, from
20 to 35 cents. It depends on the con
dition of the road and changes great
ly during the year. Ton-mile costs as
low. as 10 cents are common in Eu
rope oh first-class highways. Even
with the extreme variations of wages
it is doubtful if the cost per ton-mile
in this country on an average ade
quately-improved road exceeds 15
cents.
it is common to nnd mat wnen a
poor market road is improved the cost
of hauling is reduced by from 2 to 10
cents per ton-mile; v
The fundamental advantage of the
bond plan is the construction of a
good system of roads at once, but
there are secondary advantages In
building roads in long stretches and
in the planning and maintenance of
such roads. ,
The question is not merely whether
a community shall incur a debt; it is
also a question as to whether the
maximum economic efficiency and the
full development of the public wealth
will be best promoted by using public
credit. 'r v .
A mile of road sustaining 3,00Q tons
of travel per year, for example, would
pay interest and retirement on $1000
in 4 per cent bonds if the cost of haul
ing .were reduced 2.4 cents per ton-
mile, -z - '
In addition to the strictly measur
able economic benefits to a community
from road improvement, there are
many other economic, benefits and
very great social benefits which are
not readily, measured. Increased
school and church attendance and a
general stimulus to business result.
' The very presence of the improved
road system increases the value of the
county property.
The location of the roads to be Im
proved should not be determined by
arrangement, but upon sound engi
neering and economic principles. In

necessary to omit many roads the im

that snch property owners must pay

apparent injustice, for if the highway

Sunday Afternoon Spent by Our
Belleview Correspondent with
' the Soldiers
Belleview, August 1.
I had been threatening to inflict
my presence upon the boys from Mar
ion county who are at Black Point
and who are masquerading under the
title of "soldier." .Knowing so many
of them in private,' lif e, I wanted to
see just what difference, if any, camp
life made in th ir make-up, ' I wanted
to see why some neode dienified the
boys with the title of tin soldiers, and
ii mere were any tin soiaiers tnere,
I wanted to look at them and piste
them in my storehouse of memory.
After a careful inventory of some
mileage 'books, . and wiring some
friends in Jacksonville that, we were
leaving, Minnie and I were launched
upon our great adventure.
Spon after passing the classic
town of Santos we found the local
freight with a disabled car on ac
count of a hot-box. It delayed us two
hours, but the time was to us as
nothing, for we visited and made
friends. We rolled into Jacksonville
a couple of hours behind time, none
the worse for our wait and a big auto
whisked us out to Springfield, where
supper was waiting. '
The movies claimed Our attention
Saturday night, and it was a delight
ful feeling to walk the streets of
Jacksonville aiver so long an absence,
and recall the days of early childhood.
When I was a little girl I knew nearly
every . street car conductor in Jack
sonville and knew where every car
went. Now the whole thing is a Chi
nese puzzle.
When I lived in Jacksonville lots of
the streets were pure sand; now it is
hard to find a sand street, and Jack
sonville classes with anything of its
size 'that I have seen anywhere. So we
just reveled in the delights that the
stores, Jhe crowds and the movies fur
nished us until it got late and we were
tired and sleepy. -
Sunday afternoon our hosts, rolled
out the gas gas-eater and away we
went, a little bout thru Springfield,
over smooth streets; past magnificent
houses and churches; down town we
sped and on and over the viaduct that
lead3 to Riverside, Ortega and Black
Point, where our soldier boys were
waiting us.
Beautiful Riverside unrolled itself
before us with its elegant homes,
stately trees and well kept parks and
a we sped past streets leading down
to the water we had glimpses of the
St. Johns 'river lending a streak of
color and life to the everchanging
scenes around us until we rolled across
a big, long bridge and entered beauti
ful Ortega, and on and on we sped,
with hundreds of cars passing and re
passing us constantly,- until "halt,"
and there we were before a big gate,
with real soldiers barring the way.
And this was Black Point, the object
cf our quest.
The gate swung open and we en
tered. A panoramic view opened up
before us. . Imagine, if . you can, an
immense point of land, shaped like a
horseshoe, jutting out into a body of
water, and you have l3lack Point. The
horseshoe itself represents a fringe
of tree3 and undergrowth about 200
yards wide, extending backward from
the river front to the driveway, and
arotfhd the entire river front leaving
an immense open field or plain in the
center for maneuvers and drill work
Imagine the gate as beginning at the
inside, rim of the horseshoe, and you
