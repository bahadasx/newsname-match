THE LAND LOAN ACT
OR
RURAL
The lanf loan act or rural credits
law, recently passed by Congress, is
about the most advanced measure
of all the progressive legislation
that has been undertaken since the
" Democrats came iuto power. It
will necessarily prove of great ad
vantage to farmers and ' should
serve to greatly promote the agri
cultural interest. - .V
Under this act it should be pos
sible for any industrious andj thrif
ty farmer to buy laud, and it will
afford a ready means- to borrow
money to be used in the production
of crops. .- .: .'. :- .'y -f

Two farm-mortgage systems are
provided in the act, one for 'operate
' ing through regional land banks
and one through joint stock land
' banks. V.y" yy-; ''. . .;
The act provides for the creation
of twelve Federal land banks and
permits the establishment of any
number of joint-stock 'Jand banks
J for. the purpose of making loans at
a. reasonable rate of interest, for
long periods of time, on farm lands.
A Federal farm' loan board has
oomplete control over these banks.
rweive u eaerai lana DanKs are I
provided, one in each of twelve dis
tricts into which the country) will
be divided. These banks are em
- Dowered to lend on first mortgages
on farm lands in amounts of $100
,to $10,000 for approved purposes.
The loans are to be made through
farm loan associations and agents.
No loan may , be made for more
than 50 per cent of the value of the
- land mortgaged and 20 per cent of
the value of the permanent insured
. improvements upon it.
National farm loan associations
local organizations composed ex
ol usively of borrowers are author,
iped. These associations must be
stockholders in the land- banks in
proportion to the amount their
members wish to borrow. Even
tually all stock in the Federal land
banks will be owned exclusively by
these associations.
A reasonable interest rate is es
tablished. The act prohibits the
Federal land banks from charging
more than 6 per cent on any mort
gage, or requiring fees not approvt
ed by the farm loan board.
The borrowers will share in the
net profits of the bank because they
. are stockholders. ; It is contemplat
ed that ' ultimately the borrowers
will be the only stockholders. A
Long-term loans are provided by
authorizing mortgages for periods
of from five to forty years. j ; I
Small annual - or semi-annual
payments ; on the principal are
wade a required -feature . of all
mortgages. '
Joint-stock land banks are au
fhorized. They are corporations
fbr carrying on the business of
landing on farm mortgage security
and issuing farm loan bonds; They
are to be under the supervision of
the farm loan board, but the gov
ernment will pot invest in them.
Subject to geographical limitations
and subject to the 50 per cent aud
20 per cent limitation, these banks

amount tbey wish, and for any
purpose. They cau not charge ah
interest rate exceeding ft per cent
and such rate must not exceed by
more than 1 per cent the interest
they hae paid on their last issue
of bopds. Their mortgages, how
ever must provide tot amortization
payments These banks are pro
hibited from charging, under any
pretext, fees or "commissions other
than those authorized by the act.
Within thirty days after capital
'stock in a Federal land bank is of
fered for sale it may be purchased
by anyone. Thereafter the stock
unsold may be bough for the Sec.
rotary of the Treasury for the gov
erment. ; The government will re
ceive no- dividends on its stock.
Ultimately it' is intended that all
stock in the bank shall be owned
by the associations made up of
borrowers, and provision is made
in the law for transferring the orig
inal stock at par to the associations.
From a study of its provisions it
is easy to recognize the immense
benefit the act must prove to farm
ers. It should put newt life into
the agricultural industry and in so
doing benefit the country at large.
The products of the soil and the
thrift of the producers is the sub
stratum of all prosperity. Nash

A SUCCESSFUL HALE.
Hats off to the St. Francois
County (Mo.) Hereford Breeders'
Association I Organized less than
two years ago and composed of a
group of breeders in'a community
isolated from "the rest of the Here
ford breeding world, with little op
portunity to mix in the big events
iu Hereford breeding circles, this
live wire organization pulled off a
public sale at Jackson, Tenn., re
cently, in whjch the entire offering
was from the herds of its members
and on which the very creditable
average of $146 was made. Here
after St.'Francois County it is in
Missouri will be known to fame
for something besides zinc, It will
be zinc and Herefords or perhaps
Herefords and zinc in the future.
. In vstaging this successful sale
the St. Francois County bunch
worked in connection with some
other live wires. One of these was
L. P. Bellah, general industrial
agent ot the Nashville, Chattanoo
ga and St. Louis Railway, who has
done as much as any other man, to
say the least, to in3 prove, the quali
ty of tli9 live stock in the South.
For several years Mr. Bellah has
been promoting sale of pure bred
beef cattle in the territory tribu
tary to the Nashville, Chattanooga
and St. Louis Railway and he has
been ably backed up by his road,
which has lent every inducement
to the farmers in the territory to
grow better live " stock. A few
weeks aga Mr. Bellah, who reads
the' Hereford Journal and keeps
posted as to what is doing in Here
fordomf dropped in at Farmington,
the" center of Hereford activity in
St. Francois County and suggested
to C. B.vDeuman, the wide-awake
secretary of the association, that it
wpuld be" a good plan to hold a
Hereford Bale'' over at Jackson,
Tenn. Secretary R. J. Kinzerof
the 'Hereford association, who had
worked with Mr. Bellah before and
who had -recently Visited the St
Francois County breeders, was
communicated with and promptly
agreed to cooperate to make the
sale a success. - The Madison Coun

In Camden Monday, August 7, at 1
p. m. lor tne purpose of selecting
delegates to the West Tennessee
Farmers' Institute which will be
held at Jackson September C to 8.
Dr. F. M. McRee of Union City,
president of the West Tennessee
Farmers' Institute, aud notable
the result. '
Oh, yesl , Col. Fred Reppert was
there, : ; : ..
The sale was gotten up on a short
notice and practically all the cattle
were ju3t rounded up off the grasB
and put aboard the cars at Jackson.
At that, they presented a very cred
itable appearituce, as Herefords al
ways do, and Vere the object of
much interest to the farmers and
stockmen of Western Tennessee,
All of the buyers were from that
t ... .
section, and most of them from
Madison County. : The Nashville,
Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway
purchased three bulls which will
be kept for the accomodation of the
farmers in its territory. , .
A couple of years ago St. Fran
cois County was missionary terri
tory for Hereford breeders, and
not very promising territory at
that. And now it is out doing
missionary work for the breed on
its own account. Three rousing
cheers for St. Francois County !
