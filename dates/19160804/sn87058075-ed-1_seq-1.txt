Dropped to His Death.
"Jack" Despard, a painter employed
by J. J. Brown & Son, is dead as the
result of a fall from the M. E. church
at about 11:30 Tuesday morning. He
was at work with the Brown crew
which is painting and decorating the
church, and had, with C, H. Putman,
ben directed by Roe Brown to paint
the windows and not do any work en
the steeple or high part of the church
as it was deemed unsafe to try to
reach that part of the church with lad
ders, but for some reason Despard left
his window work and attempted to
climb to the steeple, having along lad
der on the south sipe of the building
which reached the top of the wdls,
over which he was evidentally trying to
climb or move a ladder, when he either
slipped and fell or grasped some of the
ornamental brick work on top of the
wall which gave way and fell with him,
a distance of about thirty feet, to the
ground. Mrs. J. J. Brown happened
to be passing by and saw him fall, but
did not see the cause af it.
Mr. Despard was taken to the hos
pital, where it was found that he had a
broken leg and had sustained injuries
to the head and body that resulted in
partial paralysis. Although conscious
moss of the time, he passed away rath
er suddenly about 7 o'clock Wednesday
morning.
The funeral takes place this after
noon at the Congregational church, Rev.
Kerwin officiating, and is in charge of
the Woodmen of the World.
Later—Owing to the inability of rel
atives from New York to arrive today,
the funeral has been postponed till Sat
urday afternoon.
Motorcycle Accident.
Last Saturday about noon John
Schultz was going from Lime Springs
towards home on his motorcycle. About
a half mile south of town near the
Dugon farm, he met his younger broth
er driving the family horse hitched to a
buggy. In some manner an accident
occurred, the machine running into the
horse and throwing the elder boy with
much force as to cause concussion of
the brain and very badly bruising his
face and head. A doctor was at once
summoned and upon his arrival it was
deemed advisable owing to the nature
lAlltftirMf* to have the patient con
veyed to the hospit I at Cresco. At
thia time he is slowly improving, and
unless unforseen complications develop
will soon recover. The younger "boy
was not hurt. The horse had its leg
broken and was shot. The motorcycle
was badly wrecked.—Lime Springs

(collection.
CRESCO, HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 4, 1916 $1.00 PER YEAR
Second Distribution of Auto Tax.
The state treasurer is preparing to
send out warrants to the ninety-nine
counties for the sums they are entitled
to in the second distribution of the au
tomoble registration fund for 1916.
Each county will receive $151 for every
township. The total amount to.be dis
tributed is $250,000.
The counties for 1916 get $1,407,138
from the auto fund. TLe total receiv
ed in 1915 was $1,137,766. The increase
is due to the fact that Iowa now has
176,000 automobiles registered while
the number of cars registered for the
entire twelve months last year was
146,000.
Quincy A. Willis, deputy treasurer of
state, on April 1, cut the first Tmelon
for the counties. At that time $1,157,
138 was distributed. For the same
period in 1915 the state distributed
$693,346. The new registration law
went into effect Jan. 1, 1916 requiring
all old cars to be registered before
April 1, or be subject to penalties
which increased monthly. This result
ed in a rush of registration in the first
three months of this year, increasing
the receipts of the department for that
period to an unusual degree.
Fatal Anto Accident Near Postville.
Ed Waters, a Postville stock buyer,
was autoing out to a farm northeast of
that town on Friday last when the car
in which he and his wife were riding,
was struck by a west-bound engine and
hurled a full hundred feet, instantly
killing Mr. Waters, and badly but not
fatally, injuring his wife. Mr. and
Mrs. Waters were watching for an east
bound passenger and failed to notice the
engine coming from the opposite di

engine sounded no warning.
