THE PROGRESS OF THE WA*.
The French and English have been
content during the week in holding the
ground gained on the Soinme river
against desultory German assaults and
consolidating themselves with a declar
ed purpose of pushing back the German
lines still farther.
The fighting at Verdun is now about
the same as on other parts of the lines.
The Aliies claim that the Germans were
compelled .to use part of the Verdun
army to .reinforce the troops in defend
ing the dnive of the Foench and British
on the Soaame.
The Russian drive atoll continues to
make the progress in spite of desperate
resistance by the Germans and Aust
rians? Fighting is going on along a
front of two or three hundred miles.
The Russians are now net fir from
Kowel and Leaaberg, both important
points which they are aiming to take.
The American militia on the Mexican
border have been fighting hard all this
week. Three bandits, numerous taran
tulas, many scorpions and sererai mil
lions of mosquotoes were among the
losses of the enemy. General Sheridan
once remarked that if he owned hell and
Texas that he would sell Texas. Fifty
thousand "tin-soldiers'4 add a very con
siderable to the paying population of the
border towns of that state.

accompanied her report that when she
disappeared off the capes at Hampton
Roads near the three mile-limit no Brit
ish ships were in sight.
Sir Roger Casement was hanged for
treason at London'on Wednesday. He
was the leader of the late Irish rebellion.
In this case there was not the least
question as to the legal justice of the
sentence. The' only'possible extenuation
would have been mental abbe ration.
When a man of the known strong men
tality possessed by Casement attempts
such a hopeless task as the late rebellion,
tluut is prima.f&cie insanity. The

READING THE LOCAL P4MNBB AS
A MATTER OP BUSINESS.
Why do you read? What do yon read?
Many people rend with aba»t theiama
notions with which tbey to*»eith»i
movtet. That is that MMMmnrat «1
pleasure and curiosity a«e the ipvodomi
nnting antives. Any aealtjr valuable fa.

Others read just as tfcegr drink water
or breathe ait, with but Mttle thought!
about wbem the -eapply oomre ivom or
how neoessary that the sopgty iekqpt
upor bow ouaohdt would be missed if
the supply atqpped.
Reading the jM^pera. particularly the
local papec, «honld be «onsidared as a
business maUex. While the yayer jnay
be more or less entertaiBtng«nd (bsra-i
fore more or less liaterestiag, yet as a
financial fcepoMtion the lacal ip^per is
of the best vilae.
No investment «af the yearly «spense

The average cfeioeu Aubsoriber will .on
the average during the year find «ews of:

We know this will «eem a rather «x
travagant statement to most people, but
we who are ia the business know d«o
many instances of aoaney returned to
readers that we caa make the statement
and prove it. The reason that the aver
age subscriber don't see this is beeauee
he acts upon the news he reads without
more thought, than- when he talus.
drink. He never stops to say thank yon
to the well.
As mentioned last week, there is con
siderable sentiment brewing about call
ing in outside people to participate in
the natural beauties and advantages of
Pembina. To some this sentiment is
forming the concrete in the shape of a
possible Chautauqua, to others the base
ball view is predominant, the "Arts and
Crafts" exhibition of the present week
makes a repetition a probability. Then
there is always the question of the de
sirability of outside attractions like those
of street carnivals and county fairs and
athletic sports accompaniments or speak
ers and musical organizations.
All these have advantages and disad
vantages, but it takes all kinds of things
to amuse and instruct the people.
Hence all such things may be taken into
consideration. Certainly a variety would
be more'attractive than any one particu
lar line.
An underlying sentiment is that any
such entertainment should not be in
tended or run as a money making propo
sition for the city or its people. Just to
be run -ui the interest of good-fellowship
with our friends and neighbors.
Of course this is entirely too early to
make dednite programs or arrangements
but it is not too early to get the "thinks"
going. Let every citizen without regard
to sex or previous condition think it
over, talk it over, un:til something tang
ible comes from the combined efforts
will do Pembina and its people

Henoe we may add that he who does
not read the local paper, just as a busi
ness matter, is likely to lose money. No
matter bow poor the local paper, some
time and often many times during the
year it will return the full price of sub
scription.
The business man, the housekeeper,
the student, everybody, should take the
.time methodically, to read the local pa*
per as a business matter that will pay
•big dividends.
We could give scores of cases that
would prove this statement, but a little
thought will make it prima facie. We
call attention to it just because few peo
ple .think of the local paper other than
as a mere entertainer.

ARBITRATION.
Two advertisements have appeared

any advance ia wages *r in shorter hbwti

The notable thing about the advertise
•tent is tbefaotdf.their appeannea.
is an appeal the rail way corporation
to tha people, -finch a tiling wouldihs^e
been impossible rflfty years agefc^'lt
shows that the«ailroad as well sa ether
corporations have eome to the ooocla
sion that public-sentiment means some
thing to them. Jt shews that tbef be
lieve that finally.all-such questions fill
have to be settled by the great third
party at interest, the common foapje,
who rrally owa .the irailroads sad who
really pay the ea^plqyes.
The advertisements state the railwi^'
unions have refused to allow their djibr^
ences to be arbitrated, if so then the em*'
ployes are wrong, because unless these
differences are settled by and between
the .first parties at interest then the final!
arbitration will certainly come fmm tbjfi
.public.
If this is the case then .it would seem
more sensible, pave
a groat deal of troJible
and annoyance and bad feeling to arbit
rate before rather thaa after a fight.
•Both employers aad eundoyes will be
Xorqed in the coming luture to submit
their differences to srbitration because
.they cannot fight without interfering
with .the interests,, property and peace df
the public.
The time will shortly come when it
will be as criminal for trade unions to
strike sb it will be for employers to insti
tute lock-outs. No combination that
will be injurious to trade will be allowed
either unions or corporations.
Corporations are beginning to work
on this principle and the sooner the
unions learn it the better for everybody.
PRICES RAISED.
The cost of print paper has been ad
vancing during the past year steadily,
and recently manufactuers have shoved
up the price to a point which makes its
use mighty expensive. In June of last
year the publisher-of this paper in ton
lots at 9240 per hundred pounds, now
the paper costs us 96.60 or approximate
ly 120 per cent more. In other words
every, paper alone 20 per cent more, than
twice as much as. ,thirteen months ago.
Ink, types and all materials entering in
to the making of the paper have advanc
ed and today it cost almost twice as it did
to produce a paper as it did a year a^o.
Many publishers have advanced* the
price of subscriptions while others haVe
increased the price of advertising s^sce.
The publisher of this paper has dor^e
neither, but the difference in cost of
publication has whittled down the profit
to the vanishing point. When a mer
chant receives notice of a raise on sugaf,
coffee, calico or other commodities he.
immediately adds that amount to the
selling price in order to keep from bank
ruptcy, and the newspaper man will be
obliged to do the same. If the war con
tinues much longer and prices soar pro
portionately we will be compelled to .^ad
vance the subscription price of the pap
er.—Grafton Record.
CROPS AND WEATHER.
The hot spell of the' whole month of
July seems to have broken with the 6nd
of the month. The later days are typi^
cal North Dakota days of whicli we
have had so few since spriiig opened,
May and June were so cool and July so
hot. Showers that came this week were
welcome and did good, particularly to
late barley, though much of this crop is
still very poor and is heading out close
to the ground.
The wheat crop has undoubtedly been
damaged by the hot waves of July.
A general complaint of loss of good color
and too rapid ripening is made by tar-

MUST NOT CUT IHAT
ATTACKEB WMCAT EARLY.
I have had a number of letters from
farmeta asking wether rusty wheat
should be cut early in order to keep the
grain irom shriveling. For three ears,
particnlarly in 1MM, I carried out a
number oil catting experimishta to ascer
tain whether there was aay time prev
ious to maturity at -which it was prefer
able to cut rusty wheat. These trials
even oa rusty wheat, Deemed to indicate
that it is preferable to allow the straw
to upea normally, for rust does not
attack all of the plafaie equally and
thoee that are *crt heavily attacked will
ripen aodiie piatnpeeed. If the grain is
cut While there is milk in it, all of it
will ha shrivelled. Therefore it oiy
opinion that the wheat should be al
lowed to stand until by study of the
straw and grain «aoh farmer is convin
eed that his particular field is ready to
cut. Usually the straw should be yellow
above the seoond joint from the ground.
When the kernel is pinched it should
emit no moistuaeor milk.
Observations made this year and
past years, convince me that the Bar
berry bush, commonly planted as a
hedge, should be declared public nuis
ance and be destroyed wherever possible.
This is a great destroyer .of wheat as it
starts the rust early in May. The sex
ual stage, male and female form of the
wheat rust is earned by the Barberry
•bush, and aeetns to serve as a constant
reinvigorator of the stem or "black rust."

FARM HELP.
The farmers of North Dakota will be
given additional federal aid this year in
securing harveat help. A special feder
al agent is now working in co-operation
with B. F. Flint of the state department
of labor at Bismsrck. This agent is in
close touch with agents in other states
to, the east and south, and as the har
vest work is completed in those sections,
will assist in moving the labor from
those sections to places where they are
needed in this state.
The effectiveness of this work will de
pend much upon the accuracy with
which the department is informed as to
the needs of each specific section. Com
mercial and Farmers Clubs are asked to
help in this work. Careful attention to
these matters at once will save much
loss to communities by distributing the
labor where it is most needed.
Application blanks will be furnished
upon request to the Department of La
bor at Bismarck, and when these are re
turned the department will place help
as rapidly as possible.
PULP WOOD AND PAPER.
The Warroad Pioneer takes the paper
manufacturers to task for raising the
price of printing paper as they have been
doing. The Pioneer is printed in the
heart of the pulp wood district of Min
nesota and it ought to know whereof it
speaks. The last few months the price
of paper has gone up one hundred per
dent and in some instances over that
amount. The federal commission is
making an investigation to find out the
cause of the increase and a man like
Editor Widsten ought to be able to fur
nish valuable testimony. The following
is what the Pioneer says:
With pulp wood worth no more than
it was a year ago, and labor no higher,
there is no reason for the 100 per cent
advance in the price of paper, except
that the stockholders in the paper mills
want more money. It is just' a plain
hold up.
In a letter to an active Progressive in
Michigan, Col. Roosevelt says that sev
en-eighths of the party in New York had
deserted before he ever considered
throwing in his lot once more with the
Republicans. The estimate is none too
high. For many States it is entirely too
low. The fact is that fully ninety per
cent of the Progressives of 1912 were
Republicans again now. None of the
few "converts" who Democratic head
quarters is bragging about has yet
been discovered to have had a Republi
can record. They are all ex- Democrats.
