STATUTORY CHARGES
• _\jomi Youths Arrested for Alleged
Connection With Case Involving
. 14-Year-Old Moscow Girl—
One Released
Three Pullman youths, Roy Mor
______ Owen Hammond and Jess Hat
ley, were arrested Monday on war
rants issued at the request of the
parents of a 14-year-old girl residing
at Moscow, Idaho. Morris was
charged with contributing to the de-
linquency of a minora and was taken j
to Moscow Sunday afternoon, waiv- j
ing extradition privileges. The two
other young men were charged with
"seduction and prostitution." Hat
ley crossed the line for a preliminary
hearing without extradition papers
and was at once released, the evi
dence not involving him to a suffi
cient degree to warrant holding him. j
After refusing to go Into Idaho with- j
out papers and spending Monday I
light in the Pullman jail, Hammond
experienced a change of heart when
Deputy Sheriff Baker came up from
Colfax to escort him to the county
lastile to await the arrival of the
necessary papers, and crossed the
line for his preliminary hearing.
Morris and Hammond were bound
over to the Idaho courts under $600 J
bonds, which was furnished in each
case, and returned to Pullman to
await the trial of the case. '
The case has attracted wide at- j
tention and the outcome is awaited ;
with much interest. In case the cvi- :
dence proves sufficient it is possible
that the charge against the two men,
or at least one of them, will be
changed to a federal charge under j
the white slave act, it being alleged '
that the Moscow girl was brought to
Pullman Sunday night. j
Considerable difficulty was en
countered in locating the girl in- j
TOlved, who. it is claimed, was in j
tiding in a private home here all day j
Monday. The local officers and a'
I deputy Sheriff from Moscow searched j
the house twice, it is claimed, with
out finding a trace of her. Late
Monday night, however, she was lo- j
cated at a nearby home, where she
tad gone to use the telephone, os- i
tensibly for the purpose of communi- j:
eating with Moscow friends. Her
Parents and brother were assisting i
to the search and she went home |
*ith them that night, Hatley accom- i
panying Sheriff Campbell of Moscow \
across the line at the same time.
'
Relatives of the Moscow girl, who |
■a the daughter of well known peo- :
Pie, claim that the girl was one of a
Party of three Moscow girls who j
*ere taken to the Moscow moun
tain, by the trio of Pullman boys by j

While the list of 5500 names
drawn at Spokane for priority in fil
ing upon homesteads In the Colville 1
Indian reservation contains thel
names of 29 Pullman people, only j
three of these were above the 1000
mark, assuring a good homestead.
It is figured that there are probably
1500 available quarter sections in;
the reservation, although the num-'
her Of choice parcels probably does
not exceed 250 or 300. It is expected I
that a large percentage of the
"winners" will fail to file, so that
names as low as 4000 may be in line
for a piece of the reservation land j
when their turn to select comes.
Only six per cent of the entire
registration is included in the list of |
5600 names drawn. Figuring the]
balance of the big list on the same
ratio as the first. 5500 in point of j
Pullman winners, approximately 500

The Pacific Jurisdiction, Wood
men of the World, is no more. In
its place will be a new and stronger
organization of XV. O. XV., compris
ing not only the nine Northwestern
states Included in the former Pacific
jurisdiction, but as much more terri
tory as they see fit to acquire. This
new arrangement, decided upon at
the head camp session held recently
at Denver, Colo., makes necessary a
complete new ritual for the new or
ganization, and to William Swain,
Pullman architect, fell the coveted
plum of chairman of the ritualistic
committee, the highest honor in the
gift of the head camp session.
Mr. Swain is far from a neophite
in Woodman legislative ! matters,
having taken a prominent pert in
three former bead camp sessions,
which are held only every three
years, and in each case has been
given prominent committee appoint
ments and has taken a leading
part in shaping the legislation for
the succeeding three years. The
high honor received by .Mr. Swain at
the recent session came as some
what of a surprise, but people who
know- the Pullman man recognize his
unusual ability along that line, his
deep knowledge of he big affairs of
the organization, and are convinced
that no better man could be found
for the all-important position. * Call
fornia was given two committee
members, Wyoming one and Oregon

Sad Death Takes Mother of Six Children
Mrs. Elmer Coy Dies at Age of
Twenty-nine Years, Leaving Six
Little Children —Funeral at

Oakesdale
I
I
One of the saddest deaths in the
j history of Pullman occurred last
Sunday when Mrs. Elmer Coy died
at her home on Sunnyside hill, fol
lowing the birth of a 10-pound son.
Death was due to post partrum hem
orrhage and came within a few hours
after the birth of the child, despite
1 valiant efforts on the part of physi
! cians to save her life. Funeral serv
| ices were held at the home Tuesday
morning, the Rev. J. W. Caughlan
> officiating, and the body was taken
overland in the Kimball auto-herse
j to Oakesdale and laid to rest in the
Oakesdale cemetery after a service
in which three pastors, friends of
' the family, took part.
Mrs. Coy was 29 years of age and
came to Pullman with her husband
and five children last September
from Camas prairie, Idaho. The
husband suffered an attack of pneu
monia and for several months was
ill and out of employment. Recently
he secured a position in the shops
of the Traction Street Car company
iin Spokane, and was planning to
move his family to Spokane as soon
as the expected child had arrived.

I which will be exemplified tor the
first time by a San Francisco team.
The finished product will be printed
and distributed to the various camps
later the same month.
The Pacific Jurisdiction lias form
erly not only operated under the
same ritual as the sovereign jurisdic
tion, with which it was affiliated,
but used the same pass-words and
secret work. Under the new arrange
ments new secret work and pass
words also must be arranged, and
an entirely new organization, sep
arate from the sovereign jurisdic
tion, will be maintained.
The new organization has a re
serve fund totaling $8,000,000, and
is claimed to be the most substantial
fraternal insurance in the world. New
legislation enacted at the recent
session makes the policies much
more desirable than heretofore.
Previously a member who died dur
ing the first three years of the life
of his policy received only a part of
Its face value, governed by the
length of. his membership. Under
the new legislation the full value of
the policy is paid, even though the
member dies the day following its
issue, the graded certificate plan be
ing abandoned.
The Denver session Included 160
delegates from the nine slates com
prising the Pacific Jurisdiction, and
lasted 11 days. The delegates from
the eastern Washington district in
cluded, besides Mr. Swain, F. L.
Btenbouse of Colville, N. O. Bald
win of Pomeroy, J. F. Brown of
Walla Walla and ('. E. llorton of
Spokane.
He was in Spokane at the time of
the death of his wife, but arrived
here Sunday night.
Deceased leaves besides her hus
band, six children, five boys and
one girl, the oldest being 11 years
of age. Her father was in Pullman
with her and a sister and brother
reside in Oakesdale, and another
sister and brother in Spokane. Mr.
Coy's brother and his wife, who, re
side at Newport, arrived in Pullman
Tuesday to make arrangements for
the caring of the children, taking
two of them home on the return
trip.
Mrs. Coy was a woman of many
virtues, whose entire thought was
i for her family. She made many
friends during her residence here
and her sad death is mourned by all
Pullman.
CITY BUSINESS SCARCE
A scarcity of municipal business
was the cause of one of the shortest
sessions of the city council on record
last Tuesday evening. Aside from
calling to order, reading the minutes
and adjourned, the only business
transacted was to order the city clerk
to again advertise for bids for Dis
trict No. 29 and to give permission
for the use of parts of Pine and
Paradise streets for storing building
material for the new knife factory.
I WHEAT PIUCKfI CLIMB;
FARMERS JUBILANT
The Pullman farmers who are still
holding their 1916 crops of wheat,
can get from seven to nine cents per
bushel more for it today when they
could last Friday, the sensational
advances being duo in large measure
to the reports of great damage to
the crops in North and South Da
kota, both banner wheat* states,
and to the Canadian crop, oc
casioned by the deadly black rust.
These reports caused bin advances
I in the Chicago markets, and the local
markets climbed in sympathy. Oats,
|on the other hand, have fallen off
slightly In price, being quoted here
at 10 cents the hundredweight under
| the price of last Friday. All of the
I 1915 barley crop lias been sold and
a price on the 1916 barley crop is
given for the first time this week.
Yesterday's quotations in the local
markets were:

Two of Washington State Col
lege's most popular graduates were I.
made man and wife last week when j
Raj M. O'Day and Miss Juanlta
Gregory were married at the home
of the bride's mother, Mrs. William
Gregory, at Sunnyslde. The cere
mony was a quiet affair and was per
formed by the Rev. Terry of the
Sunnyslde Baptist church in the
presence of the relatives of the con
tracting parties. Mr. and Mrs. O'Day
will return to Pullman this week
and will be at home to their many .
friends at 404 Montgomery street.
Both the young people were active
in student affairs during their col-1
lege careers and both made hosts of
friends who extend congratulations
and well wishes. Mr. O'Day received
bis degree in economic science and I
history with the class of 1915 after a |
I four-year course, during which be I
enjoyed many student honors. He,
served as editor of the Evergreen,
the student publication, in a very
capable manner, and was colonel of;
( the cadet regiment, accompanying
Ithe embryo soldiers in that capacity I
.to the Pan-American exposition in
San Francisco. Ho was a member j
of the Gamma Delta fraternity and j
was an excellent student. Mr. O'Day !
is a son of T. J. O'Day of Pullman.
Since graduation he has been em- j
ployed as an assistant to Accountant!
XV. C. Kruegel and has displayed un- j
usual aptitude for business affairs. '
Mrs. O'Day, as Miss Juanita
Gregory, was without doubt one of
the most popular and charming
young ladies who ever attended the
i State College. She *!so took an ac- j
| tive part in tho student and social
' affairs which, are so great a part
of student life. She was accorded
one of the greatest honors In the
gift of the student body when she <
was elected queen of the May last
j year over a field of four exception- {
ally strong candidates, and executed
the difficult role with a grace and i
charm that brought much favorable :
comment. Miss Gregory was also
chairman of the "Big Five" com
mittee of young ladles which had,
charge of the activities of the col- ;
legs women on last campus day. She!
Is a member of the Pi Beta Phi!
sorority and received her degrees
last June from the department of

PULLMAN TO STAGE
COUNTY CLUB FAIR
County lAliiblt of Hoys' and Girls'
Club Work Will lie Held Mere
.Middle of September
, The county exhibit of the work of
the boys' and girls' clubs of Whit
man county will be held in Pull
man about the middle of September,
the Chamber of commerce having
adopted the report of the agricul
tural committee, which endorsed the
I plan at its Tuesday luncheon, la
all probability tin exhibit will be
held the week previous to the state
I fair at North Yakima, which is set
i tor September 18 to 23, although
| the dates have not been definitely
j decided upon.
A committee consisting of R. c.
Holt, D. F. Staley, ,1. W. Mathews
md Bruce Lampson was appointed
to solicit funds for the exhibit, and
make complete arrangements. They
have already secured subscriptions
which assure that little trouble will
be experienced in raising the $250
necessary to stage the attraction.
The premium list, which includes
first, second and third prizes in tin
various departments of club work,
■alls for an expenditure of between
1 To and $200, and the balance will
be required for Incidental expenses.
In all probability the annual hog
show will lie abandoned this year
to make way for the club fair, so
thai the business men will not be
asked to sign subscription petition!
for both events.
it is expected that fully 400 ex
hibits will be included in the county
lisplay and that members and par
ants from all parts of the county will
be attracted to Pullman. The prize
winners in the different depart
ments will be sent to the state fair
it North Yakima, where their ex
hibits will be entered in stale compe
it ion. Fifty dollars toward sending
he winning boys and girls to North
Yakima will come through the
munty school superintendent and
he winners will be entertained while
.here by the fair management.
NARROW ESCAPE
A timely tire blowout averted an
accident which might have resulted
jerlously in the Moscow mountains
Sunday, according to reports of Pull
man parties who Sundayed in the
mountains. A Ford automobile,
carrying the three Pullman boys who
figured in the sensational ease
brought by the parents of a Moscow
girl, and three girls from Moscow,
proved unequal to the task of climb
ing a steep hill just beyond "Tarry-a-
While." and the engine stopped sud
denly. The machine started back
ward down the hill and was just on
the point of turning over Into a shal
low ravine when one of the tires on
the lower side blew out, the force of
the explosion righting the machine
and averting the accident, which
without doubt would have .resulted in
serious injury or possibly death.
8000 MILES TO ENTER W. S. C.
That the fame of the State Col
lege of Washington is spieadfag
to all corners at the globe Is in
dicated by the fact that Robert
N. Jus to, a native of Buenos
.tyres, has traveled over 8000
miles to enter tlie college tills
fall to take a full course in horti
culture. Mr. Junto has already
arrived in the state and Is now
employed on a large fruit ranch,
where he is getting practical ex
perience in his chosen line. He
intends to complete his course
here and return to his native land,
where he will engage in the apple
raising business on a large scale
on on his father's extensive land
holdings.
Mr. Jnsto became Interested in
the apple industry through a rep
resentative nt a Wenatchee fruit
marketing agency in his home
city. Most of the apples at home,
Mr. Justo says, are Imported from
Spain, are of inferior quality and
sell for $1 a dozen. Tho large,
fine apples of Washington are a
great delicacy and bard to obtain
down there. ;-.
