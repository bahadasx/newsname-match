to.vnoN, Aug. 3. Fleury has been
eempletely reoccupled by the French
Hoops In the course of their vigorous
ounter offensive at Verdun. Attacked
mutancou'ly from the northwest and

Resides this, the French took all the

At Clienols, where they lost ground
Tuesday, they recaptured most of the

Allies on the front along the Somme.

Not yet reconciled to the loss of Del

for the' British waited until the enemy
was In close range, then opened Ore, do

Intent on Improving their position west
of Pozleres. the British shelled a Qer

Thlepval. The fire was so effective the
garrison fled, only to be caught aa It
i-rossed the open ground by the Are from
the British field suns. A little to the
1st of this the British gained a hit of
ground north of Baxentln-Ie-Fetlt by a
bombing attack.

n ns a result of their study of short

The lull In the fighting on the Somme
front Is due solely to the fact that the
Hermans have had time to recover from
'he staggering blows delivered against

army headquarters In France writes.

Norfolk, Va Aug. I. The allied
cruisers patrolling the entrance to
Hampton noads to prevent the depart
ure of the German submarine merchant
man Deutschland were In position within
sight of shore to-day and there was
nothing to Indicate they were aware of
the passage of the Deutschland tut
through the capes last night.
Capt. Hlnech. who on bonrd the tug
Thomas F. Tlmmlns directed the de
parture of the Deutschland. said to-day
that the underwater freighter passed
unobserved within one hundred yards of
a I'nlted States destroyer on neutrality
duty about a mile oft the capes. He
also disclosed that the submarine sub
merged twice on her way down the bay
to test her engines.
"When no tralhc was In sight the
Deutschland took a dive while running,"
said Capt. lllnach. "She went down
until only four Inches of her periscope)
was showing above the water. Then I
dropped behind to see at what distance
the wake of the Deutschland or the foam
crest of the periscope could be seen. At
400 yards, with glasses, I could n -t sen
a thing,
"In the afternoon we started for the
capes. The destroyer was passed In the
dark. Later, when I reported that the
Deutschland had cleared the enpee and
was on her way to sea the ofllcers aboard
the destroyer seemed surprised They
bad not obsenert her at all. So you see
that the British and French ciulsers off
ahore hadn't the slightest chance of find
ing the Deutschland."
When the vesselH were a mile off the
capes the submarine Increased her speed,
and the men aboard the Tlmmlns, which
had stopped, watched her as she sped for
tliu open sea, A mile away all her lights
suddenly disappeared. Capt. Ilinsch
said he knew the vessel submerged at
that time, when a mile Inside the three
mile limit.
In response to questions regarding the
prospects of the Bremen, sister ship to
the Deutschland. arriving In American
waters, Capt. Hlnsch said: "you can
depend upon It that If the Hremen was
coming In the near future I would not be
rrturntng to Baltimore and neither would

ing no more than manufacturers can give
them from vanishing supplies. That a
famine In news print paper will result
within a few months unless these econo
mica are effected was the prediction of
paper manufacturers yesterday.
Only a husbanding of resources by the
papers themselves, particularly those of
New York, can stave off the crisis, It was
admitted throughout the trade. There-Inn VfUfM tVAT IA1
fore the announcement printed In Tim!JO AiflrTif UCiAU lit
SUN and other papers of limiting news
dealers' supplies strictly to sates and the
agreement of publishers of Manhattan to
decrease the else of the papers met with
approval.
At the present time In the t'nited
States ami Canada fifty mills ate work-
Ing three shifts of men eight hours dally
and six das a week. Their output for
June the last compilation was 140,151 J
tons, representing 95.4 per cent, of their 1
maximum production, the highest efll.
rleticy ever attained in me industry
This output represents an Increase of!
.uuu tons h monin mrr inr omr ii
.lune, 1915, but even this tremendous in
crease has been Insufficient to feed the
demand. Full production has had to be
augumented by 5,000 tons niori a month,
which was drawn trom a rapidly depict
ing reserve stock.
Surplus f.radnallr Shrinks.
Surplus stock has been swallowed up
at this rate for several months now. At
tr end of June only 65,191 tons re
mained In storehouses that at the same
time last year held 91,97 tons. The
minimum is In sight, appreciation of
which fact brought the newspaper pub
lishers to their agreement on Tuesday.
' . .. . . 1 1 I m
Were production to cease to-day there is
not cnoush news nrlnt DMDer stored to
keen newspapers alive for ten days. It,
has been necessary for the publishers'
mutual good and the benefit of the news
reading public to curb the tendency
toward Increasing the stxe of papers at
this time of year.
The figures cited here for June wilt
take n considerable advance In October,
usually the banner month In the news
paper jear. As a rule circulation In
creases In the fall anil advertising keeps
apace with It. As a result more pages
have to be added to the dally paper
and the Sunday takes on unusual bulk.
Without the measuies taken by the
publishers this fall's Increase would wipe
out the total production and tha reserve
stock. Fur this reason Till: Sun's rule
to refus unsold copies will become ef
fectlve on Monday.
It may be asked by the public, "Why
did not the. paper manufacturers antici
pate this tremendous lucreae In de
mand?" They did, so far as It was
humanly possible to anticipate u pi as
perity. Since June, 1915. there lias been
added to the mills of this country and
Canada 15 per cent, more facilities for
turning wood Into paper. When tin
orders were given It seemed, according
to the manufacturers, uu extremely risky
