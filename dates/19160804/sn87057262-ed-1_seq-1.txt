NEW'YORK, Ang. 4.—The United
States would face-one at the most
certous food situations in decades, if
the threatened strike of 400,000 rail
road men should materialize and be
come a protracted fight, according to
opinions collected in a score of the
larger cities by the United Press to
day. As the Impending tie-up of 250,
000 miles of railroad toy the army of
railway employes, would ie the great
est of all strikes, so would the re
sultant loss and suffering be the
greatest, business men from coast to
coast declared.
Coast cities and cities located on
navigable streams -wtould be least
«0Mted, according itfthe-wyOTpeslnm
of opinions. But they would be hard
hit nevertheless.
Bahles and children would Teel the
brunt of such a strike. There would
obviously he great difficulty in «up
Irtying perishable food stuffs to
thickly populated centers, ©Ten with
water facilities. Shortage of milk
would be the first felt, the opinions
agree. Shortage of other food stuffs
would come according to how perish
able they are, as weH as to supplies
held in warehouses end storage
.Slants.
Som® cities could get along after a
aw ion for anywhere fnom two weeks
to two months, steps haying already
own taken by city officials and pub
lic organizations looking toward mo
tor supply trains that would scour out
lying districts for food stuffs. .Phila
delphia is one of these.
At the city statistician's office there
it was stated that authbrities would
mobilize thirty thousand automobiles
gather supplies from the rich farm
ing lands for forty miles west, south'
uid north of the city. The supplies
°n hand there now, officials said,
would not last any length of time.
New York being a clearing point
tor many other cities, could live for
weeks, but until organization of motor
transportation could be accomplished,
there would be some tapping of pro
ducing territory by way of the Hud
ion.
Pittsburgh, on three rivers, might
thereby be saved from real food strin
gency. Officials there said auto trans
portation undoubtedly would figure in
relieving the situation.
Boston would suffer very little, ac
cording to Professor Cunningham,
statistician and railroad expert of
Karvard, despite the fact that the
Hour supply there now Is low. Boston
now has enough butter and eggs in
warehouses to last through the winter,
hut meat would be very scarce. Pro
fessor Cunningham said.

cilities would prevent extreme suffer-

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff

NEW YORK, Aug. 4.—Next week
the real political tumult and shouting
will begin. The opening season for
orators starts Monday. From then on
to November the air will be full of
words. Looking forward today, it
seemed safe to predict that no previ
ous campaign will approach the one
now just beginning,to get under way
in quantity of oratory, amplitude of
speakers and miles traveled- by candi
dates.
Republican Nominee Hughes at
Bridgehampton today was polishing
off the drafts of the various speeches
he will deliver on his trans-continen
tal/ trip Monday. At Washington,
Senator James Hamilton Lewis of
Chicago was conferring with leaders
in response to a drafting from the
national democratic committee here
to "follow up" the Hughes trail,

children.
Dispatches received today said that
only three boat-loads of survivors has
been landed thus far, two at Syracuse
and one at Malta.
Survivors declared that a panic en
sued during the lowering of the boats
when the submarine, over-hauling the
steamer after a short chase began
shelling her at close range. A number
of passengers and crew are reported
to have been killed and wounded by
shell fire.
The Letlmbro is the first large pas

several months. She was attacked
by one of the fleet of Austro-Cerman

TREATY SIGNED
ite FOR BUNDS
United States to Buy Danish
West Indies From
-Denmark for
$25,000,000.
SAILS MUST BE RATIFIED
Former Objections to the Purchase
Are Now Absent and the
Deal Will Go
Through.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.—The treaty
between Denmark and the United
States for the purohase of the Danish
West Indies for $25,000,000 was
signed in New Yiork today by Secre
tary of State Lansing and Minister
Brun, the state department announced
today.
Early ratification of the treaty Is
expected. The sentiment of the
United States senate faVors such
action and unofficial word from Cop
enhagen is that the conservative
party which rejected the proposal for
the sale In 1902, Is not now opposed
to the sale.
(Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee, said today
the opposition to the Danish West In
dies purchase apparently was neg
ligible and that "he believed the vote
to conform the treaty would be un
animous. The only opposition at all
was because of the price, he said.
Under the treaty, the United States
obtains the islands of St. Croix, St.
John and St. Thomas, east of Porto
Rioo. It surrenders its discovery
right in the north of Greenland. The
treaty must be ratified by the Dan
ish and American governments and
the people of the islands.
The house of representatives, as
well as the senate, will have to ratify
the treaty for this country, because
of the money involved.
From the United States standpoint,
the chief gain in getting the islands
is strategic. For European govern
ments to hold the West Indies is con
sidered to threaten this country's in
