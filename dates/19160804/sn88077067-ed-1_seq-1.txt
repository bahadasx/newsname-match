IGreeiivllle Dally Advociitn.
In the mandamus euse of iu stubs of
Ohio ex rid the Commissioners of Mercer
County vs. the Commissioners of Durke
County, Judge Bowman decided the ca.se
In favor of the plaintiff Monday morn
ing.
In making tilt decision Judge Bowman
ftulid tlmt the Darke County commis
sioners tiled an answer In the l'robute
Court of Mercer county stating that they
were unable to reach any agreement re
minding the amount of money that should
be assessed utjutnxl the county for bene
fits received from the ditch tlmt drains a
large portion of land in the northern part
of tliiM county, but which is sltuuted In
Mercer county. The Commissioners ask-
ed that a committee of four freeholders
be appointed by the l'robute Judge of
Mercer county to determine the umount
of the assessment. Four freeholders, two
from Darke und two from Mercer county
Were uppointed and cume to tiie conclus
ion that Darke county should pay (12,
820.20 for the benefits derived therefrom.
The Commissioners of Darke county
took exceptions to the ruling of the com
mittee and took the case to the .Supreme
Cour of Ohio. This tribunul held that tne
decision of the cominttee was legal and
that Darke county should pay the amount
specified.
However, the Commissioners neglected
to do this and a short time ago tne Com
missioners of Mercer County filed a pe
tition in the Common Pleas Court of
Darke county to force the Commissioners
of Darke County to pay the amount set
on by the committee.
Judge Uuwiiinn held that the amount
was Just in proportion to tne beneuts ae
rived therefrom and ordered uie commis
sioners to make a levy on the land own
ers receiving beriellts from tiie Ultch.
TIiIm does not invulve the lund.
Alter the assessments are made accord-
Inn to benellts derived the property own
ers have the right to uppeal to the courts
for redress If they think that tile assess
ment Is unjust.

WILL THE
OHIO STATE
EXPLAIN T
JOURNAL
A soldier has no more right to get
drunk llian u preacher. Ho cannot be
faithful to his country If he defies
God's law, und getting drunk Is one
of the forms of defiance. In fact,
intemperance bus done tills country
more harm than all the Mexican,
Spanish, British or Confederate guns
have done; und the man w ho will cul
tivate Unit vice Is us much un enemy
of the Republic as they were."
The above paragraph is from an edi
torial in the Ohio State Journal und ev
ery word Is true. But the young soldier
hoys are not the only persons who are
to blame fur whatever drunkenness there
is among the men of the militia. Mob-1
ilization camps are located neur big cit
es und the boys ure down street in great
numbers. They ure away from home and
temporarilly from the discipline of camp
life. The saloons find many of these
young men susceptible and every Induce
ment is offered them to drink.
In Columbus the past Week big adver
tisements have appeared in the daily pup
ers, illustrating soldier life, uniform und
all, and appealing to the "physical fit
ness" which can be gained by drinking
certain brands of intoxicants. It was a
sordid appeal to the soldier boys to enter
saloons and "booze up." Such advertise
ments are as unpatriotic and un-American
as the saloon itself.
What about a newspaper that carries
such advertisements? Is it not a big
factor in debauching Ihe soldier boys?
We ask Uie Ohio State Journal if it
did not publish such an advertisement,
and we would like to ask the Journal to
explain the consistency between the ad
vertisement and Uie editorial paragraph
which heads tins article. American Issue.

SEEING THE FAIR
Just a few words to my friends (of
course, I have but few) about us being at
the Banner Fair last year. 1915. We were
more than surprised. Why, when we got
tO'he fair ground gates, we met such
genteel fellows, who were so anxious to
assist MuifeiA any way they could. We
bought n fiiiHWjckt. niy wife and I and
the lrtyJ" fPn aidgirlsj including old
Dic)t a:ad ,llroWre)r. out -sack of hay and
Wats. lifrJfWMket wU filled with the
best a rainier ca gto
right, in tfounVvT 1
best a farmer cTW grow and it cost only
i
oie push. We drove
K.T" been there 25 times
or mi), t; aiuwyiider one of those fine
shsde I i-ces Diet hav there, unhitchd
old Dick.KgWfi'iPffi some water they have
a lot of VUllbo then tied him to one of
those nWiicia hitching posts which Dick
could njVin break down, then went back
to the iiiiYey and the family, were all
waiting t, ),iee Uie sights. We visited the
displays, of sheep, hogs, cattle, hogs and
poultry, lv awn son Sam was ao Dleas-
ed with Hfo lot of sheep displayed that
we could hardly get him away from there,
my son Isaac I always call him a hog, be
cause there Is no animal he admires as
much as a hog. When we went through
the hog department he said "Pa, them
are better hogs than ours, but in a few
years we will have some to equal them,"
and I'eter, he is my horse and cattle boy,
says. "They have us all skinnftd when it
comes to horses and cattle." Dydia and
F.liza say they ure not Bure but think
they have some hens about as good as
they saw at the fair. Then we went and
examined the machinery and automobiles.
Of course, we would like a lot of them
things, but we haven't got the money to
buy tiu tne nest ot everytning, so tne
bovs .-ay, "Pa. do not tempt us, or we
might get in tiie notion." so 1 drew their
attention to the Ar Hall and Agricultural
Hall, tiie state exhibit. We witnessed the
grand parade on the race track, it is
worth going 51) miles to see: the children
say they never saw such a lot of fine
horses and cattle, niy wue. fliary Ann,
hud been pulling my sleeve for a long
time, so 1 asked her what toe trouble
could be. she says it is leeaing time, i
mi getting hungry." So we went back to
the surrey, got out our basket, spread a
cover on the grass and partook of one of
the best meals 1 ever ate. We enjoyed It
so much we intend going again this year.
then fed old Dick, took in the racing,
hich was surely fine, took in a few of
the shows and then drov home. The
bos and girls talked of the Fair for
months and they say are sure going again
this year. We have an auto, that it
what I call it, but the children say It is no
automobile, it is only a Ford. I noticed
last vear they were very nice to the auto
owners if thy would only obey their orders
and drive us told. Hope to see you, my
friends, at the fair during 11)16. I expect
to be there most every day this year; be
cause we have a Ford and it only costs
Jjl for four flay I for the whou) push.
ANDREW SMITH HURT IN FALL
FROM WAGON
Andrew Smith, of Hopewell township,
was painfully injured last Saturday morn
ing when he fell from a wagon, while
working on his farm,
Mr .Smith was hauling fertilizer from
his barnyard and the team he was driv
ing ran away throw ing him from the wag
on and breaking his leg and bruising his
head and face considerably.
Air. Smith is sixty-five years of age
and he feels he was slightly overcome by
the intense heat and the exertion in hold
ing down the team caused him to fall
from the wagon.
Because of his age, the physician
thought the accident to be very serious,
however, Mr. Smith is at the present do
ing as well as could be expected.

WHAT IS A SILO WORTH?
Did you know that corn In the silo is
worth 40 per cent more than corn in the
shock? And that every farmer who
builds a silo increases the efficiency of his
acres aliout 35 per cent? Recent experi
ments show that silage when used with
cottonseed meal for fattening cattle pro
duced gains as a cost of $4 less per hun
dred pounds than when corn, stover and
hay made up the ration?
Atost silo owners say that a silo Is prof
liable to the furmer who feeds at least
ten head of cows or fattening cattle the
vear round. One and one-half inches of
silage should be fed dally to insure a
minimum loss from spoiling. The alio
should be at least 10 feet in diameter.
