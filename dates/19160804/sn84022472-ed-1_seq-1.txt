Pays Dearly. ;
Failure to obey-; the "Safey First"
precaution of shutting off the -power
of a moulding cutting machine while
changing the size of the cutter heads
at the plant of the Frank Miller Lum

arsik, 80 years old, of 90 Courtland

off a short distance below the elbow
by the blades, turning at 4,000 revolu
tions a minute. -,
Peparsik, who had 'heen running
the machine in the moulding room of
the plant for six months, was loosen
ing a bolt on the machine and did not
shut off the power as he had been
warned. ' The bolt did not move and
Peparsik applied more leverage with
the result that lt loosened quickly,
causing the wrench to 'slip. ' ,
With the sudden lurch forward he
put out his haud to save himself, and
it was caught between the revolving
blades-which are arranged four to
each cutter head and of which there
are several in the - machine for the
different sized grooves.. The hand
was cut completely in two pieces and
the arm was drawn into the machine.
His body resting against the base of
the machine prevented the arm being
drawn further into the mechanism.

CASEMENT HERE
ON SECRET TRIP
FOR IRISH CAUSE
BridgeportEntertainedIrish
Knight But Guard Details
"v of His Visit.
i
With the execution of Sir Roger
Casement at Pentonville Jail.' yester
day, the fact that the Irish revolution
ist visited Bridgeport a year .ago, in
the interests of Jrish freedom, became
known, here. x "
Details of the Irish knight's visit to
Bridgeport had been carefully guard
ed, for he came here on a secret mis
sion. It was admitted, today, how
ever, by, the' delegation of sympathiz
ers with the cause of Irish freedom
who met him, that he really had visit
ed Bridgeport, and took steps to foster
here the spirit -of sympathy for Irish
oppression that has beenvthe founda
tion of many Irish organizations.
Casement's visit to Bridgeport was
brief. ' He spent less than two hours
in the city. He was entertained by
Attorney John J. Cullinan, William
Clifford, Frederick C. .Mullins. Col. T.
J. Murphy, all of this city and Wil
liam Mahoney, . the postmaster at
Westfleld, Mass. , ,
It was the plan of the Bridgeport
ers to bring Casement to Bridgeport to
deliver a speech in the cause of Ire
land! But the visitor, who fcefore his
arrival had exacted pledges of se
crecy'as to his coming, counselled
against the plan. ; He v said he be
lieved his work for the cause of Ire
land could be accomplished, just at
that time, better. by working privately
than in public".
The Bridgeporters who took part
in the conference, today admitted that
Casement was herte, but they would
not go into detail as to tho circum
stances of his visit.

Expense to People, Through
Inefficiency of Health De-'

Doubt That Milk Caused
Deaths, He Declares,
Padlocks May Be Used To
Enforce Quarantines-Expert
Adopts "Extraordi
nary Methods" to Prevent
Contagion To Ask Weal

'
Bridgeport's epidemic of septic sore
throat," the fear of which has been
.overshadowed by the Infantile paral
ysis peril, has cost the people, of the
city more than $100,000, according to
Dr. Abraham Sophian, the expert who
is fighting the poliomyelitis plague
here.
At a meeting of the board of health
this afternoon in the office of Mayor
Wilson, Dr. Sophian' asserted hat the
cost of the epidemic to the families
.that were ' afflicted, and to the tax
payers was tremendous. ' ,
"The abstract value on the lives of
the patients, that died, the cost inci
dental to death, the value to time lost
members of the family, the losses
to bYisTness through Illnesses, and the
sudden placing of a burden on the
city, all enter into .the-Sstimate," said
Dr. Sophian. - ' .
"It may be $100,000. It . may be
many , times that amount, but it ; is
tremendous at any rate." ' '
Dr. Sophian said this expense was
created by inefficiency. The wort of
inspecting milk and food, and of en
forcing sanitaion hasn't been entrust
ed to competent hands. '
"There is no doubt that the septio
sore throat is caused by milk," skid
Dr. Sophjan. - j
The ,cost of treating patients with
infantile paralysis is 100 times more
now than Bridgeport should pay, ac
cording to the expert. This also,, is
due to lack of preparedness. "
What were termed'"extraordinary
measures'' werfe adopted today by the
board of health because of the sudden
increase yesterday in the number of
patients 111 with poliomyelitis. Threats
have been made that padlocks, will be
used, if necessary, to (enforce -quarantines,

mans Many Germans Are Taken Prisoners,
French Claim.
Berlinl Aug. 4 The village of Fleury, north of Verdun was:
regained by Germans this morning, it was officially announced!
today by the" German army headquarters. j
i Paris, Aug. 4 Attacking simultaneously from .the north-!
west and from the southeast, French troops yesterday stormed;
the village of Fleury, three miles north of Verdun, and captured
several hundred Germans. - -
' In the eveping,. however , the Germans launched a furiouSj
counter attack and after several violent attempts Succeeded in''
getting a footing in the southern part of the village. I .
The French today continue to hold the northern section of;
the place and heavy fighting still is in progress.
The official statement issued last
night by the Frehch war department,
announcing the capture of Fleury by
the French troops and recording' other
operations of the day along the west
ern front, said:
; "On the right bank of the Meuse
our infantryi continuing their offensive
action on the Thiaumont-Fleury front,
captured .during the day by a, series
of successive attacks all the trenches
comprised between these two points' as
far as a point southeast of Thiaumont
work and in the vicinity of Hill $20.
"The village of leury was attacked
simultaneously on the northwest 'and
on the southeast and was entirely oc
cupied y our troops after a brilliant
action. The number of prisoners
taken in the course of this action and
so far counted . exceeds 660. This
brings up to 1,750 the total number
of unwounded prisoners taken by, us
on the right bank of the Meuse since
August .';' ' ' ' '
: Thetert of the official statement
given out .this afternobn by the
French war department, in which it is
admitted that the Germans have suc
ceeded in recapturing a portion of
the village of Fleury, follows:
"On the right bank of the river
Meuse the battle continued along the
Thiaumont-Fleury front, which ' the
Germans attacked all last night with
great ferocity. ' Several counter at
tacks In large numbers upon our po
sitions near the Thiaumont work were
repulsed with heavy losses for our ad
versaries. . In the course of the fight
ing our troops even occupied the Thi
aumont work, but they were compell
ed subsequently to 'evacuate it under
the powerful German bombardment.
They brought back with them 80 pris
oners, . ' i -
"There hds been fighting no 'less
violent in the region of Fleury. The
Germans multiplied the number of
counter attacks upon this village.
Bach was preceded by an Intense pre
paratory artiilery fire. After sevefal
fruitless endeavors the Germans se
cured a tooting Jn the southern part
of Fleury. where very spirited fighting
is still going on. All efforts made
to dislodge us from the positions to
the southeast of this . vKlage were
checked by the .resistance of our
troops.
"The ' enemy attacked In like man
ner durinir the night our new posi
tions to the east of Vaucherauville.
They succeeded only In suffering heavy
losses. In the vicinity of Vaux-le-Chapitre
and Chenois the artillery
fighting has been very spirited."
Verdun again is in the center of tho
war stagn. The . - recapture by the
French of the village of Fleury, which
had been held by the ' Germans for
more than a month, caused great ela
tion in France. It vis the fruit of
French slow and methodical offensive
