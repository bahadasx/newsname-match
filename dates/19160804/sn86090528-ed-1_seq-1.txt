,
That at least three men were not
fatally Injured in an automobile acci
dent which occurred at. 1:50 o'clock
this morning is one of the mysteries
which often attend automobile smash
upa, That the chassis of the Stude
baker car which was overturned sus
tained no further damage lhan a bro
ke n left, roar wheel is another oddity
of automobile juggling.
The results, however, were serious
enough. One man, X. P. Nungester,
a traveling salesman, lies in the hos
pital in a very serious condition, ac
cording to a statement made by Dr.
Downey at noon. The driver of tbe
car. J. V. Carpenter, who is a Stude
huttcr salesman, sustained painful
though not serious Injuries, according
ty his attending physician, Dr. Antle,
K. 12. Wren, proprietor of the Wren
drug store, sustained a scalp wound,
bad bruises about the bead and other
injuries, painful but in no way serious.
Conflicting opinions due to tho ra
pidity with which things happened
within a very short space of time, were
given by various parties concerned.
What actually happened was that Car
penter, while ' running side by ' side
with A. C. Keys, who was driving a
Mitchell Six and declaring that he
was keeping well within his right-of-way,
ran dangerously close to the
curbing in front of tho home of Mrs.
DeKinder on Seventh street and Colo
rado avenue and while the front
wheels were fully eighteen inches
from the curbing as plainly shown by
the tracks of his skidding car, his
rear wheel, in making a quick turu on
a slanting street, struck the curbing,
tearing the wheel from its bearings.
The rear of tho car hugged the curb
ing for a distance of several feet, then
met with sufficient obstruction to
turn the car over. The tops and wind
shield both being up, withstood a suf
l'i lent amount of the blow to afford
protection to the occupants of tbe
Studebaker.
The car must have been moving at
Colorado avenue and struck the oppo
site corner.
During the knockabout tactics In
which the car indulged, the steering
wheel was broken but the steering
gear left intact, as was also the en
gine, which was turned off after the
car finally stopped. ,
When the men were removed from
the car it was found that Mr. Nunges
ter was seriously hurt. While it can
not yet be determined whether the in
jury at the base of the brain is duo
to a fracture or to a concussion,
which sometimes requires two or
three days to determine, in either case
the injury is a dangerous one. His
collar bone was broken and a bone
from a double fracture of bis wrist is
protruding from the skin. His case,
however, is not hopeless by any means.
His wife has been summoned and is
expected to arrive from Oklahoma
City this afternoon .
Carpenter is confined to his room
with sprained' muscles of his back.
and bruises and lacerations in various
parts of his body. He was resting
easily at noon today and felt more
concerned and worried more over the
condition of Nungester than he did
over his own plight.
"Mr. Carpenter was well within his
right-of-way," declared P. G. Splning,
distributor of the Studebaker car to
an Express representative,' fiftor be
had gone over the .scene of the acci
dent with a view to ascertaining its
cause. As to the rate of speed at
which either car was going I do r.oi.
care to discuss."
Why Car Turned Over.
The top of the Studebaker Six, the
fenders, the steering post and one
wheel were completely demolished but j
the chassis or body of the car, except
ing the left rear wheel.was not dam
aged. I "There have been 125 Studebakers
sold out of thin, office," continued Mr.
Spinlng, "bat. this is the first accident
of its Idnd that has been recorded
among them. The center of gravity
of a Studebaker car is very "low and
'safe and had the car not been so
quickly turned after meeting With th
first accident it would not have tipped
over. This is the. first case of its kind
in this territory."
I Wh ther or not the men were rac
ing at the time of the accident or
whether Carpenter was being crowd
ed has not been testified to by eye wit
nesses who did not seem to know nmny
of the details.
Mrs. Homer Meyers, residing on the
i opposite corner of Seventh and Colo
rado from where the car stopped, said
she was awake preceding the accklent
and that the men were coming down
the street at a high rate of speed but
had slowed up before the Studebaker
car struck the curbing.
"It is lucky that anyone in the two
! cars escaped alive," she said today,
j "After the car had run into the side
' walk and started toward the center of
j the street barely missed a collision
with the Mitchell car which had pass-
a good rate of speed for when it left:"' ' ' '"
the curbing it left the ground for a j Rescues Companions,
distance' of eighteen feet, then struck Although suffering from painful
tbe street on its front fender and ra- scalp wounds, Mr. Wren, immediately
diator on the right side and turned upon the termination of tbe wreck,
completely ' over once. Then, conlin- jumped from his seat and went to the
rescue of his companions in the de
molished Studebakpr. i
"Tbe car was not going very fast
at the time of the accident," ho de
clared this morning, "not nearly so
fast as I have ridden in Chlckasha,
although previous to the first break
down we had been racing for about
threo blocks. In the Studebaker' were
Carpenter, who drove the .car, Nun
gester and myself, Mr. Nungester was
here on one of his regular trips and
always uses his own Jitney. He drove
up to my store at midnight just as
we were closing and asked me to take
a spin with him. After making a turn
or two he drove his car into tho Ford
garage and we had just come out of
the garage and were standing on the
sidewalk preparatory to bidding each
other good night when Carpenter
drove up in a six cylinder car. "Hoys,
jump in and take a ride,' he said. We
did so and he took u out to the base
ball park. Returning we met the
Mitchell six. There was absolutely
none In either car who was under the
influence of 'liquor. It was simply a
case of accident.
"After racing for three blocks both
slackened their speed and it was after
this that the Studebaker first ran into
the curbing before reaching Colora
do, knocking off a rear wheel. The
car rolled completely over three
times before finally being ditched on
the corner and after jumping from
the sidewalk wltli three wheels it
veered and collided slightly sidewiso
with the Mitchell car. When the two
cars met I had my right hand on the
outside and it was caught between the
two cars and skinned.
"During the time I . was crouched
well into tjie hind seat but. was struck
by tho bow wn.in I received my scalp
wounds, being also bruised about the
shoulder and knee. Aa, soon as the
car loft "the side of the Mitchell and
plunged into the corner curbing I
jumped and pulled both of the men out
of the front seat. When the car turn
ed Nungester had alighted on his
shoulder. Carpenter was harder to
get to as the machine turned over on
the driver's side. After taking Car
penter to safety I turned off the en
gine of nut car ITw Carpenter es
caped instant" death f do pot know as
his steering wheel was completely
hroko.n off." .
X. P. Nungester, who was the most
badly Injured of the trio, is a resi
dent of Oklahoma City, where his wife
and family reside. He travels tor the
National Novelty ..company and has
been making Chlckasha for the past
three years. With his own jitney he
is said to be a very careful driver,
taking not the slightest chance. He
is suffering from a fractured skull
slightly below the- base of the brain,
a fractured wrist, and a broken collar
bone.
Mr. Wren attended to missions for
Mr. Nungester this morning and af
ter visiting him at the hospital return
ed to the Wren Drug Store where he
spent the morning, apparently not
much the worse for the accident until
one got a glimpse of his pate.
After the Accident.
Mrs. Mabel DeKinder was perhaps
the only eye witness, to. the affair out
side of tbe occupants of the two cars.
Hearing a crash in front of her win
dow which she believed t he an ex
plosion, Mrs. DeKinder J glanced out
the window to see the Studebaker car
reeling toward the. curbing on Sev
enth street about seventy-five feet
south of Colorado avenue. Hearing
cries her first thought was that a ser
vice car had overturned with women
