Babies and children would feel the
brunt of such a strike. There would
obviously be great difficulty In sup-
plying perlsDable foodstuffs to thick-
ly populated centers, even with water
facilities. Shortage ot milk would
be the first felt, the opinions agree.
Shortage of other foodstuffs would

Washington, Ang. 4.--General Car-
ranca still insists tbat the first thing
to (be decided by the United States
and Mexico is tho withdrawal of the
American troops. Mexican Ambassa
dor Arredondo today delivered to Act-
Ing Secretary of State Polk a note,
which, r while naming a commission
and tacitly accepting the latest Amer
ican proposal for a joint commission
to Investigate Mexican-American re
lations, laid stress upon the f set that
the Mexican commissioners are to de
vote their attention preferably to
the resolution ot the points mention
ed In tbe previous note of this depart
ment . . . '
The points referred to are the ques
ftlong of withdrawal ot United States
troops from Mexican soil, border pa
trol and fixing of responsibility for
border raids. ' .
'Washington officials agreed that
Carranza in this manner is Indicating
his Intention to urge these questions
ahead of all others.
No specific mention is made of say
broader issues to be discussed, al
though the last United States note
particularly pointed out that the ad
ministration desires to go Into a
larger discussion ot the Mexican prob
lem than the purely military phase.
No doubt has yet been expressed,
however, by state department officials
that the Mexican conferees will show
a willingness to take up questions ot
Mexican finances and industrial de
velopment. On the other hand, the
note Implies that the commissioners
will follow whatever lead Is made by
American members, as they have been
instructed to devote their attention
preferably to the military problem.
