HUGHES ASKED TO
EXPLAIN "ATTITUDE
Writers Request Nominee to Give
. Reasons or Antagonism for
President Wilson.
New York, Aug. 2 On behalf of a
committee of distinguished American'
writers, the executive group of which
met Tuesday at 'the Hotel Baltimore
here, George Creel gave out the fol
lowing open letter:
"To the Hon. Charles, E. Hughes:
"The professional writers who sign
this letter have small interest in par
ties, but a very deep interest in dem
ocracy. It is our hope, through this
voluntary association, to assist in the
promotion of an honest educational
discussion in order that fundamental
issues may not be decided in prejudice
and ignorance.
'Mr. Wilson's beliefs have been ex
pressed in law and declared policies.
He has made an open record by which
he may be judged. Wise choice is not
possible unless you yourself make
equally specific statements of pur
poses and convictions.
"Without any intention to offend, we
feel .justified in charging that in no
single public utterance have you filed
a bona fide bill of particulars, nor
have you offered a single specific
suggestion. Generalities are without
value; blanket criticism is worthless.
"What we desire to know and it is
fair that the electorate should know,
are the exact details of your disagree
ment with President Wilson. What
has he done that you would not have
done, and what has he failed to do
that you would have done or propose
to do Honesty and patriotism de
mand that you put yourself upon rec
ord in such manner as to permit people
to Judge you as they are now able to
judge President Wilson. For example,
would you have filed instant protest
against the invasion of Belgium and
backed up that protest with the United
States navy?
"It is arrant nonsense to talk about
action that would have prevented the
Lusitania tragedy. The vague ad
vertisement did not appear until
shortly before the hour of sailing. The
occurrence was one of those things
that civilization has made the world)
regard as incredible. The only hon-
est question is this: 'Would you have
made the disaster the subject of diplo
matic negotiations or would you have
broken relations at once ?'
"Would you have urged upon con
gress an embargo upon the shipment
of munitions to the allies ?
"Would you urge universal compul
sory military service?
"Would you be frank in stating that
Huerta's morals were of no concern to
America? Does this mean that you
would have recognized Huerta?
, "As matters stand today, would you
be in favor of intervening in Mexico ?
"Does your attack upon the shipping
bill mean that you are in favor of ship
subsidies?
"You speak of the rights of the
worker. Does this imply that you
endorse the Clayton anti-trust law and
the seamen's bill? Or would you
urge their repeal ?
"What are your specific complaints
against the federal reserve law ?
"As governor of New York you op
posed the income tax amendment.
Does this antagonism persist? Do
you not believe in paying for pre
paredness out of a tax of incomes, in
heritances and munitions?
"We agree with you that it is a
critical period, by far too critical in-
deed, for candidates to talk in terms
of the office-seeker rather than in the
simple, earnest language of definite
Americanism."
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Ruscha, of Vero

Mrs. John Moore.

The rain is sure coming, not to save
the corn but the fodder for roughness.
Most' of the corn has got its age and
will not come out.
The Smith store, better known as
the Carter store, that burned down
last week was quite a misfortune all
around. It was very convenient for
the nearby community and Mr. Smith
was building up a good trade. As to
the origin of the fire we do not know.
Mr. Purcell and brother had a narrow
escape. They were sleeping in the
front room and were awakened about
midnight by a smothering smoke. All
the front windows ami doors were
barred and, locked and they were with
in 20 feet of 200 gallons of coal oil.
Their first thought ias to hike for
tall timber. While one secured the
money drawer the other got an axe
and knocked the door out into the
street. Just a3 they got out the oil
can exploded.
Miss Georgia Stribling returned
from Springfield last Sunday. She re
ports a hard rain with lightning and
hail. While looking out on the street
she saw a bolt of lightning strike a

ly. As several candidates are some
times on for the same office all will
be turned down but one, then they will
go out whooping things up.
News is on the down grade just

they would hold us responsible.

Kings Prairie perhaps is more ex
tensively advertised than any territory
of its size in the Southwest. It can
stand anything but a drouth in crop
time. It is bounded on the west by the
thriving city of Monett, on the north
is Swede Center on the east is Pleas
ant Ridge and on the south is Flat
Creek and the famous Spout spring,
that is noted for its healing and cool
ing properties. In hot weather its cli
mate is mild, except when it gets too
hot. Its soil is diversified and will pro
duce all the grains, fruits and veg
etables usually grown in a temperate
zone (if it rains). The latch strings
at all the doors, both front and back,
hang on the outside. A hearty wel
come is extended to all strangers and
wayfaring, no matter how much mon
ey they have. That's Kings Prairie.
Some one said they didn't believe
all the story about sending a wireless
message to Mars. There is where
they are missing it. They want to
believe everything they hear whether
it is so or not. It may happen some
time. If you are old enough you will
remember when we didn't believe any
thing. What would we have thought
forty years ago if we had looked up
and seen a drove of biplanes and aero
planes sailing like buzzards in the
air, flopping their winggs, making a
roar like a cyclone, dropping bombs
and blowing holes in the earth as big
as barns We would have ducked our
heads and hiked for our fraid holes.
Yes, believe anything and be ready for
the change.

Tugboat Which Accompanied Deutsch.
land Down Bay Reports Its
Escape to Open Sea.
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 3-The German
submarine merchantman Deutschland
passed quietly out of the Virginia
capes at 8:30 last night on her home
ward voyage, apparently unobserved
by the allied warship patrol waiting
outside the three-mile limit. She was
accompanied to the capes only by the
tug Thomas F. Timmins, which . had
convoyed her down the bay from Balti
more, and by a newspaper dispatch
boat.
Her departure to sea followed an
18-mile dash through the lower Ches
apeake bay. After proceeding slowly
most of the way down, she increased
her power at 6:30 and reached the
capes just after dusk. None of the
allied cruisers was visible as she went
through.
Whether she submerged before
reaching the three-mile limit is un
known. The two accompanying boats
only know that she disappeared un
harmed and that to all appearance she
had a clear field ahead to a point
where she could completely submerge
in safety, Half an hour after the
last light of the Deutschland had dis
appeared, the Timmins, satisfied with
her work, turned back and headed up
Chesapeake bay in the direction of
Baltimore.
During part of the day the Deutsch
land had remained hidden at a cove
up Chesapeake bay.
