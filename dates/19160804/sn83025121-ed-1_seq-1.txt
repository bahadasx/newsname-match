President Gets In Touch With Sit

450,000 Men Walk Out and
Paralyz Traffic Over Roads
(AssoclsUd frees by Mm Wireless)
WAHHLNUTON, August 4,Every
agency at (be disposal of the
1 nited Htates government in
being urn! to avert the therntened
strike of 4.ri),000 railroad employes.
The good offices; of the President have
hoc ii called into the battle for peace
in the transportation world. The Ren
ate ia working harmoniously and hard
on the question, and it is regarded
here en likely that today the senate
eommerce committee wilV take up the
consideration of the resolution intro
dtx-ed by Hen a tor New lands of Nevada
providing for .thorough investigation
of tbe hours and amount of labor per
formed by the railroad men, by the
Interstate Commerce, Commission.
William Chambers, commissioner of
' the - federal board of mediation and
conciliation, conferred "with the Preeb
dent at the White Ilonse yesterday in
ennneati wit htthe situation.
inTtorf'poHifotieV Jo-ecUer-to W' in 'po
sition to Intervene if the strike seems
inevitable, j The vote of the railroad
men to date appears to favor a walk
out. The results of tbe national vote,
which is taken by mail,' are expected
to be known August 8.
Government May Seise Railroads
Immediate aeixnre of very railroad ir
the United Htates by the federal gov
ernment, with government ownershij
as a certain result, la predicted by J.
.1. Keognn, commissioner of the United
Htates department of labor, should thr.
threatened strike of the four great rail
road brotherhoods become a reality.
Kelgan would not say that plant
already had been formulated for such
governmental action, but he did deelarr
that, according to bis information and
belief, the step would be inevitable.'
He referred to the resolution intro
duced in congress by Senator New
lands authorising the appointment of a
commission to study the general ques
tion of government ownership and op
oration of railroads.
Expects Big Majority Tor Strike
Kecgnn pointed out thnt the Inter
state Commerce Commission for thre
years has been appraising the valua
tinn of the rsi Iron ds of the I'nited
Htates, and declared the federal gov
ernment, um a result, was better pre
pared than ever before to assume th(
responsibility of ownership.
"From tbe best information I have,"
declared tbe) labor, department com
missioner. "I am confident that the
great raaV and file of the four broth
erhoods will vote for strike. I aar
led to believe that mora than ninety
nine per cent of the members of tbf
four great organisations will vote foi
a ' walkout.'
Thinks Compromise Will Be Made
"I do not believe, however, that f
strike is probable. I cannot reconcib
such a development under existing eon
ditions. J cannot conceive that eithet
railroad mann,lment or brotherhood
officials will permit the break t a come
A compromise seems more probable.
"But, if the break should come, ant'
450,000 trainmen are called out, par
nlyzing the transportation facilities of
the country and even threatening Am
erinan people with starvation, the fed
rrul government would act, and ac'
within twenty-four hours. It could d
nothing else. Kvory railroad in thi
country would be aeized, and once thes
roads pass into the control of tin
I'nited Htntea they would never agaii
lie returned to private ownership."
Tbe commissioner was -asked ho
the government would find ft possible
to operate tbe roads, onee the near!)
half-million employes had .gone ot
strike.
Men Would Oct Eight hour Day
"They would go to work the next
morning if the government assume
control," replied the ' commissioner
"The men know that they would br
treated honestly and fairly by the Unit
ed Htates. Huch aelaure would at onec
remove the bone of contention ' whicl
ia responsible for the present threaten
ed strike the eight-hour day, . Tin
