Park-To-Park Road Will Be Logged
By Way of Cut Bank By A. A. A.
Incalculable benefit to Cut Bank is the decision reach
ed at a meeting of directors of the Great Falls Commer
cial Club, Saturday last, which means that the routing of
the Park-to-Park* highway will by way of Cut Bank, in
the bluebook of the American Automoble Association.
Not with a desire for personal glory but to apprise
the public of the details of this important matter, the fol
lowing is taken from Sunday's Great tails 1 ribune:
The directors of the Great
Falls commercial club met for a
noon luncheon at the park hotel
yesterday and gave further
consideration to the question
of such cooperation as might be
extended on the part of local
people to the commissioners of
Teton county in arranging an
adequate highway to Glacier
national Park. The luncheon
was in part occasioned by the
presence in the city of Dan
Whetstone, editor of the Pioneer
Press of C u t B a n k. Mr.
Whetstone, as the guest of the
commercial club, spoke regard
ing the proposed roadways
across the Blackfeet Indian
reservation from the standpoint
of the people of Cut Bank. He
opened his remarks by em
phasizing the friendly relations
that are existing between this
city and his home town. He
said that the people of Cut Bank
wished to become even better
friends of Great Falls.
Whiie not presuming UK>peak
at all with authority from the
commissioners of Teton county
Mr, Whetstone was still very
firmly of the opinion that they
would not entertain the con-,
struction of a road across the
ßiackfeet reservation unless it
be the one by way of Cut
Bank. His view was further
that the proposed north and
south route branching off at or
near Dupuyer, whiie it perhaps
was shorter in miles, would not
be anywhere nearly as ser
viceable to the traveling public
going from park-to-park. He
thought that the average auto
mobile traveler would veiy
much perfer to keep in a more
settled country and nearer to
assistance in case of trouble.
The point was also brought out
that there was also a large
travel going through Teton
county from points east of Cut
Bank which would be better
served by the roadway going
through that city than by the
north and south route branch
ing off at Dupuyer.
Mr. Whetstone was of the
opinion that it would be a good
thing to have a conference at
Choteau, attended by repre
sentatives from the Great Pails
commercial club and perhaps
some people from Cnt Bank
and Browning, so that the whole
matter might be taken up with
the commissioners of Teton
county and so that everybody
interested might know what
they are willing to do in this
matter.
O. S. Warden was called
upon and outlined a conference
that he had recently had with
some of the people at Browning
in regard to this road across the
reservation. He was of the
opinion that the all im
portant thing was to securc a
good road by wav of some
acceptable and agreed upon j
route. His understanding was
that the matter was really in
the hands of the commissioners
of Teton county, inasmuch as
the route would have to be
surveyed by them and their
plat would have to be filed,
with the government before
action could
be taken.
He
emphasized the importance of
pushing the matter to a con
clusion and that the route by
way of Cut Bank would surely
be an acceptable solution for
the present time. He also
favored Mr. Whetstone's idea
of a conference to study out
what could be done all along
the line for the betterment of
the park-to-park highways, so
that it might be available for
next season's travel.
T. H. Larkin, W. H. George,
Sam Stephenson and Walter S.
Clark took a part in a general
discussion of the question.
R. A. Woodall, editor of the
American Associat'n Bluebook
and F. S. Whiting also associated
with the Blue Book were guests
as well at the luncheon, and
Mr. Woodall spoke briefly
about the desirability of having
it determined what road would
be used for the park-to-park
travel next season so that it
could be adequately represented
in his publication. The con
sensus of opinion at the lunch
eon was that the Cut Bank
route would have to be used
next season and the only
question seems to be how
much can it be improved in the
meantime.—Great Falls Tribune
Big Baseball Day
Sunday will be a gala base
ball day in Cut Bank, two
games being listed for the day
by Manager Carl Hawkins. At
10:30 Cut Bank will go on with
Browning and at 2:30 afternoon
one of the above teams will
battle with the so far unbeat
able Williams team. The
Williams team played eight
games this season and won
every game. Local fans are
planning lo make Sunday a
memorable day in baseball
history here.
A. G. Gothenquist wau a Cut
Bank visitor last week, coming
down from Medicine Hat,
where he is engaged in drilling
for oil on an extensive scale.
He has a half interest in twelve
drilling outfits in that section
and has already struck gas in
several wells. He expects to
ship an outfit to Wyoming in
the near future, and one to the
vicinity of Demers, where
the prospects of finding oil look
encouraging.
The recent ruling permitting
filing on additional land by
those who have not taken a
half section is most sweeping
and liberal and many local
people are making additional
filings. It has made a neat
little harvest for the real estate
men who have kept tab on open
tracts hereabouts.
Christ Sewald was in from
the Kevin section Tuesday and
was highly enthusiastic over
the exceptional crop prospect
out that wav. He declared
that he had an eighty acre
wheat field that was more
promising than any seen in this
section last year.
The Presbyterian Ladies' Aid
will meet in the Masonic hall

Esther Vanormer
Esther, the oldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. F. VanOrmer
died this morning at two o'clock
after an illness of four days,
with peritonitis. The case was
not considered particularly
serious until last evening and
every effort was made to save
the life of the little girl. Mrs.
VanOrmer is absent, at her
former home in Ohio and
burial will be deferred until
her arrival. It will be a
most sorrowful homecoming
for the stricken mother. The
community has beon deeply
moved by this sudden taking
off. Esther was a pupil in the
local school and was a great
favorite among her classmates
in the public and Presbyterian
Sunday School. The Pioneer
Press extends sincere sympathy
to the parents in this hour of
great grief.

LivingstonAlmost
A Model Town
Livingston is so much like
Cut Bank in point of location
and opportunities that its his
tory and development are es
pecially interesting to us.
A few years ago Livingston
was a slovenly border town,
with no spirit of unity and no
impulse toward civic improve
ment. How Livingston woke
up, realized and appraised her
self, makes an interesting chap
ter, as told by citizens of that
little city, who are proud of her
municipal achievements in the
past few years.
Let it suffice to say that to
day Livingston is one of the
cleanest, prettiest and most
spirited cities in all Montana.
Miles of cement walks, streets
with beautiful electric light
poles, metropolitan buildings of
brick and stone and above all
sanitary conditions that are
ideal. The streets are cleaned
and sprinkled several times a
day and all garbage is collected
in cans, placed in the rear of
homes and business places—big
city methods in every detail.
Livingston has little more
than Cut Bank in the way of
resources. It is a railway
terminal on the N. P., and its
payroll not much larger than
ours. The Yellowstone Park
traffic is probably quite a source
of revenue during a short period
of the year. In its immediate
vicinity there isn't enough
farming land to sustain a snow
bird. The tewn lays claim to
the Shields River Valley, more
than 25 miles away. It is also
the county seat of Park county.
It is spirit that has pulled
Livingston out of small town
lethargy and made it a pulsing
little city. It has a modern
chamber of commerce with an
alert secretary. Its hotels, the
big beneficiaries of the Park
traflice, do not hold back and
"let George do it." The men
who are making their money
are working as a unit to make
Livingston still bigger and
better. Many sleepy Montana
towns still living in the atmos
phere of the old cow days could
find inspiration in the big ac
complishments of the Park
county metropolis.
T. J. Larson suffered a sun
stroke last Friday, whiie work
ing about his auto repair shop,
and has been very ill all week.
Yesterday evening Mr. Larson
showed signs of improvement
and his friends are hoping that
he will soon be back to normal
health.
