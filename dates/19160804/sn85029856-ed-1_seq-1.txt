ELECTION PASSED OFF QUIETLY

a very quiet affair. The Democrats
had no contests on the county ticket
and pnly one (that of governor) on
the state ticket. The Republicans
had two county offices with more
than one candidate for each, besides
the state and district offices. It looks
like Simmons Is nominated tor con
gress on that ticket. Clyde R. Com
mons is thought to have carried the
district for Btate senator, but the re
. turns from all the counties have not
been reported. as we go to press. Ray
Mlllman was nominated for register
of deeds and A. B. Fullmer was re

Our Trade Has Increased by Leaps and Bounds
WHY?
Because we are delivering the goods that

Most men are practical on the clothes subject. They want style
of course; they want satisfactory wear; That's why
we make so many friends 1 by selling

"The same price the nation over."
It takes ability, capital and Big Business to produce a superior
article at an average price-Styleplus Clothes $17. That's
why we can save you from $3 to $5 on a suit.

. PLAYGROUND THRIVING
Last week saw the largest increase
In the attendance at the playground
of any week since its beginning. The
new apparatus has attracted a good
many and the grounds are being well
patronized by the young folks. Mr.
Hestwood takes his boys' class for a
swim once a week. The season is
about half over so those not yet en
rolled had better take advantageot
the opportunity and begin soon.
WORKING FOR BETTER ROADS
Several car loads of Liberal's busi
ness men, representing the Liberal
Chamber of Commerce, Journeyed
out to the Blue Bell school house
Friday night and met with about 60
of the farmers of that district to or
ganize a good roads movement. The
meeting was the best of Its kind ever
pulled off in this part of the coun
try and almost every fhrmer In the
vicinity turned out. It was a rousing
meeting, full of pep and enthusiasm.
The business men and farmers gave
short talks on road building and dis
cussed the roads in general. A plan
was launched to build several miles
of gyp clay roads running east from
Liberal. It is intended to extend the
road later and connect up with the
Meade county road. The Chamber of
Commerce has a good, live road com
mittee and the organization is devot
ing much of its energy to the build
ing of good roads all over Liberal's
trade territory.
Alva Stevens of Hugoton and
George Kasson of Moscow were Lib
eral visitors Sunday.
We fix things
Our repair department Is In skillful hands.
We do our repair work right, yet we charge only a moderate
price for the Rood work we do.
Bring In your watch If It Isn't keeping time; It should be cleaned
every year or so, anyway, to preserve It.

WILL ORGANIZE MOOSE LODGE
Liberal will be full of Moose in the
next few days. Not the Big Bull va
riety, however, but the full-fledged
members of the Loyal Order of
Moose. Chas. B. Loop, district or
ganizer for that order, has been busy
the last few weeks gathering in mem
bers for the opening and has already
secured over 60 members, some of
whom are prominent citizens. The
intention is to fit up a club home as
soon as the subordinate lodge is In
stituted. It Is probable that the
Dodge City lodge, No. 1187, which
has a membership of over 800, will
be present to help in the initiation
ceremonies on the opening night, and
Gerald F. Gahan, national director of
the organization, with headquarters
in Mooseheart, Illinois, is also ex
pected to be here at that time.
SCHOOL CENSUS INCREASED
The school census completed last
week by Miss Mildred Feather
showed a very satisfactory increase
in children of scholastic age In Lib
eral. The present census showed 401
girls and 413 boys In the district, a
total of 814 eligible to attend school
next fall. Last year's census showed
only 639, making an Increase of 176.
Miss Feather raked the town over
thoroughly in her' gathering of
names, and it is doubtful if anyone
escaped whose name should go on
the records.
"Good evening, how do you feel?
asked a transient of a Liberal lady
Tuesday evening while the Jady was
traveling through an unlighted part
of. town. "Good evening, and how
do YOU feel?" replied the lady as
she rapped the gentleman in question
over the head with a heavy stick she
was carrying as protection against
stray dogs, with a force that nearly
sprained her hand. The fresh one nev
er tarried long enough to answer the
question, but it is thought his head
felt the next day like the morning
after the night before.
Mr. and Mrs. Dell Reeves have
moved back on their farm south of
town to spend the ' winter. Mrs.
Reeves will teach school in that dis
trict during the coming term and Mr.
Reeves will try his hand at farming
again, which he had to give up a
while back on account of failing
health. , '

BROKE OUT OF JAIL
Dick Wisdom and Henry Craaon,
the parties mentioned In these col
umns last week who were committed
to Jail ' for holding up some men
near the depot week before lastv'
broke out of the Seward county Jail
Monday night, and haven't been seen,
since high twelve yesterday. They
used pocket knives to cut through
the laths and plaster on the celling,
crawled through the aperture and
walked over to the bead of the stair
way, where they descended and made
their walk-out It is reported that a
party saw the boys walk out and
never reported the same to the sheriff
until an hour afterwards. Cards
have been mailed out by Sheriff Dob
son to the officers of surrounding
towns and It is hoped to bring them
back Into the fold before many more
moons. This is the second Jail
breaking, performed In practically
the same manner, in less than a year.
and It would be a mighty good mere
on the part of our county commis
sioners to make a small appropria
tion for a steel ceiling as a part of
the county bastile's Interior decora
tion. It Is not so expensive as
catching, trying and then catching
again, the prisoners who are commit
ted to the sheriff's care.
The L. T. L. met the last of the
week on the lawn at the home of
Mrs. Moore and held their July pic
nic. About twenty little people were
present and (enjoyed themselves by
playing games and telling stories for
couple of hours. Cake and sher
bet were Berved before they depart
ed for their homes. The August pic
nic will be announced later. Mrs.
Vlckers, Superintendent.
Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Sawyer and
family left Wednesday for their an
nual vacation. They left in their car
and will join other parties In Elk
hart and proceed to the rivers and
mountains of Colorado, where good
nailing and recreation may be had.
Mrs. Sawyer aUo hopes to get relief
from hay fever while gone.
A WEEK OF FIRES
Liberal has been visited by three
small fires this week. The first waa
Friday afternoon late, when the saw
dust and shavings back of the Prints
& Son wood working shop caught
afire and was blazing merrily when
discovered. The only damage was an
outbuilding burned. The second was
Tuesday night about 11 o'clock when
a small shed back ot the Southwest
ern Hardware Company was seen on
fire by the men working In the Stone
garage. The fire whistle sounded
and the lire wagon was there in Just
four minutes from the tlfoe ' the
alarm was Sounded. No serious dam-' '
age.-was yuMaAaiA-Autf Ahs.rf was
soon out. Yesterday morning a gaso
line stove exploded at the home of
Mrs. Lipscomb on Third street, but
the fire fighting appartus was soon on
hand and no serious fire resulted.
For a bunch ot amateur volunteer
firemen, we must hand It to the Lib
eral firemen on the Stir they make
when the alarm sounds. They get
action and they get It right now when
the call comes, and they never lose
their heads and get things balled up
when they get to the scene ot the Ore.
The fire fighting equipment has only
been here a few weeks but we believe
k has already prevented enough fires
to more than pay tor Itself.
The present summer Is about the
hottest the country has had since the
mind of man runneth not to the con
trary. Heat prostrations are report
ed from the cities by the score, and
horses that have to work on pave
ment are dropping like files. No re
lief Is offered by the weather bureau
for several weeks, afld unless an un
forseen change takes place old Sol's
toll of life will mount up to the
thousands.
The city has bad men at work
trimming the weeds along the side
walks in the business part of town
during the past week or two. It
helped the looks of things wonderful
ly in the sections where things were
cleaned up, but someone should get
busy in the residence districts and do
the same thing. Weeds are unsightly
and unhealthy conditions result from
too great an abundance of them. ' -..
