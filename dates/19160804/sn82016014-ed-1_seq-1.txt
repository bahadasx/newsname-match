PREPARING TO
BREAK STRIKE
Officials and Employes at High

Stocking Up With Coal in An
ticipation of the Strike.
With the day when the count of the
vote on the general strike of the four
great railroad brotherhoods la expect
ed to be announced only four days
away, tension in Topeka and Kansas
rallron'd circles is drawn tight as bow
strings. The outcome of the ballot,
railroad officials and employes alike
say. Is mere speculation. Meanwhile
Kansas railroads, that are in a position
to do so, are preparing to break the
strike if a satisfactory settlement is
not reached.
C W. Kouns, general manager for
the'rianta Fe, is on his way to New
Yolk with other general managers
who are pUying the role of "watchful
waiting." The role also might be
termed "watchful worrying."
When Mr. Kouns left a few days ago
he asserted that no idea of what the
brotherhoods would attempt to do or
what the outcome of the strike vote
would be could be ascertained.
"Anything printed or said about the
outcome of the ballot would be purely
speculative," he said.
Affects 9,000 Kniployes.
The controverry affects approxi
mately S.OtiO railroad employes, train
men, in Kansas. It was said l.l the
Santa Fe offices today that number
includes one-fifth jf the entire num
ber of railroad employes in Kansas
The principal demands of the rail
road brotherhoods consist of an eight
hour basic day and time and one-half
for overtime. Figures compiled by
the railroads show those demand?, the
actual wage increase, would mean
$100,000,000 to the railroads of the
United States. To the Santa Fe Vone..
according to officials, the Increase
would mean $4,752,388.
"It would he unfair to the bulk .
railroad employes to giant such an
increase." a railroad official said to
day "The four brotherhoods draw
2 8 per cent of the total wages paid
American employes now. The strlk",
by the way. would affect 18 per cent
of the total number of railroad em
ployes In this country.
"Such an. increase as the employes
demand would mean the railroads
would have to have a 5 per cent in
crease in freight rates.
"By that I mean freight rates not
r.nly in Kansas but all over the coun
try. ""And they are not raising freight
rates very fast, but they will have to.
"So. the people will have to pty."
Would Bankrupt Roads.
A western railroad official recently
slated that the demands of the broth
erhoods, if obtained, would bankrupt
every road in The United States.
The count of the strike vote is ex
pected to be completed and announced
Tuesday. However, It is pointed out,
the brotherhoods are not compelled to
announce the result and may not do
so. After the count the general man
nsers of the employes' committee will
aK"!r. go into a conference.
Tho brotherhoods' committee has
Informed the general managers' con
ference that they are against arbitra
tion. Newspapers friendly to the em
ployes have announced that there will
not be arbitration. The railroads
have stated flatly they will not meet
the demands of the brotherhoods but
have offered to meet the employes in
arbitration. However, it is known,
there will be no strike or definite ac
tion until after the next conference in
New York which is expected to begin
Tuesday.
Kansas railroads, however, are pre
paring fcr an emergency.
The Santa Fe is advertising for
trainmen and it is understood the
roe.d has already a big list of applica
tions. That Is interpreted in railway
circles here to mean that the road will
attempt to run trains if the employes
strike. Many western railroads are
also stocking up with coal and taking
other steps to be prepared.

This was the driest July on record in Kansas. There were no rains in
the state during the entire month except scattered showers and a few rather
heavy rains that were extremely local in character. There was not enough
rain to be measured over approximately a tenth of the state, and most of
the monthly amounts reported were less than half an inch. No place had
enough moisture for its needs during the month.
SERIOUSJHASE
Some Coast Cities Could Sub
stitute Water Traffic.
Milk Shortage Would Be Felt
Keenly In Cities.
K. C. WOULD BE HARD HIT
Couldn't Stand Nation-Wide
Tieup 24 Hours.
Many Cities Already Plan to
Mobilize Autos.
New York, Aug. 4. The United
States would face one of the most
serious food situations in decades. If
the threatened strike of 400,000 rail
road men should materialize and be
come a pr tracted fight, according to
opinions collected in a score of the
larger cities today. As the impend!. 1
tieup of 250,000 miles of railroad by
the army of railway employes would
be the greatest of all strikes, so would
the resultant loss and suffering be the
greatest business men from coast to
coast declared.
Coast cities and cities located on
navigable streams would be least af
fected, according to the symposium of
opinions. But they would be hard hit
nevertheless. Babies and children
would feel the brunt of such a strike.
There would obviously be great diffi
culty in supplying perishable food
stuffs to thickly populated centers
even with water facilities. Shortage
of milk would be the first felt, the
opinions ajrree. Shortage of ether
foodstuffs would come according to
how perishable they are, as well as to
supplies held in warehouses and stor
age plants.
dries to Mobilize Antos.
Some cities could get along after a
fashion for anywhere from two weeks
two months. Steps having already
been taken by city officials and public
organizations looking toward motor
supply trains that would scour outly
ing districts for foodstuffs. Philadel
phia is one of these.
At the city statistician's office there
it was stated that authorities would
mobilize 30,000 automobiles to gather
supplies from the rich farming lands
for forty miles west, south and north
of the city. Supplies on hand there
now, officials said, would not last any
length of time.
New York, being a clearing house
for many other cities, could live for
weeks but until organization of motor
transportation could be achieved,
there would be some suffering. Some
of the producing territory up-state
could be tapped by way of the Hudson.
Pittsburg, located on three rivers,
might thereby be saved from a real
food stringency. City officials there
said automobile transportation un
doubtedly would figure in relieving the
situation. There are large supplies in
Pittsburg at present. It has fresh
goods and meats to last about forty-

TORNADO JAYS WASTE
Damage to Crops and Buildings
$1,000,000 on Canadian Border.
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 4. Buildings
were wrecked and blown across rail
way tracks, and crop damage con
servatively estimated at more than
$1,000,000 resulted from a tornado in
northern Minnesota and southern Can
ada early today. The district about
Crookston, Minn., was heaviest hit. It
is believed no lives were lost.
Reports from Carlisle, Sask., to
Winnipeg declared 100 square miles of
grain territory In that vicinity was
laid waste by hail. The loss to grow
ing wheat was serious. Scores of silos
filled with grain were wrecked by tha

Washington. Aug. 4. General Car

Mexico is the withdrawal of the Amer

A redondo today delivered to Acting
Secretary Polk a note which, while
naming a commission to investigate
Mexican-American relations, laid
stress on the fact that the Mexican
commissioners are "to devote their at

the points mentioned in the previous
note of this department."
Three Points Involved.
The points referred to are the ques

troops from Mexican soil, border pa

border raids. .
Washington officials agreed that
Carranza in this manner is indicating
his intention to urge these questions
ahead of all others. No specific men

be discussed, although the last Amer

the administration desires to go into

Reports of Black Rust In Canada Af

Chicago, Aug. 4. Wheat dealers
today ignored Canadian official de

rust in Saskatchewan, and Instead gave
renewed attention to reports from
trade sources that the pest covered a
greater extent of the province than
had heretofore been believd. Advices
were worse also as to the crop in
Manitoba.
The result was a sharp advance in
prices to the highest level yet this
season. Nearly five cents a bushel was
added to the value of wheat, the Sep
tember delivery touching 134 as
against 129 at yesterday's finish. To
day's close was strong at nearly the top

R. R. UNIONS WIN POINT
Senate Committee Turns Down Re
quest for Probe of R. R. Wages.
Washington, Aug. 4. Railway
brotherhoods won an important point
before congress today when the sen
ate interstate commerce committee
tabled resolution looking toward me
diation of the controversy by the in
terstate commerce commission.
The committee took up the resolu
tion on a written request from the
United States chambe- of commerce,
which asked for hearings.
"It was determined," said Chairman
Newlands after the committee acted, "to
have no hearings upon the subject but
to lay the resolution upon the table.
The committee deemed it inadvisable
while proceedings were pending under
the mediation arbitration act, to take
up the subject of the pay and taours of
service of railway employes. It was
also deemed inadvisable to add to the
present duties of the interstate com
merce commission which as is well
known is overloaded with work."
! The committee had before It a let
! ter from the brotherhoods as follows:
"The railway managers and the rep-
resentatlves of the railroads' organiza.
i tions will confer in New York early in
August and we believe the committee
I on interstate commerce should remain
I neutral at least until Jointly called
upon oy tne national conference com
mittee of railway managers and the
representatives of the railroad broth
erhoods, and we respectfully suggest
this course of action."

Incomplete. '
counties, Walter "L. Payne of Bur
I lingame Is unquestionably nominated
for state treasurer on the Republican
ticket
W. D. Ross apparently is nominated
for a third term with a plurality that
will reach 10.000. Fred W. Knapp of
Reloit has a lead of 2.000 over Frank
i Oriran for state auditor. Only In-
! creased nluralities for Organ in east-
' r ,
era counties can crowu xvu&pp uul i
the nomination.
Payne today Increased his lead and
steadilv drew away from Matt Weight-
man of Topeka and Charles Evans of
: Good land, although a number of
i strong Evans counties are yet to re
port. These will aouDiess put xne
Goodland man In second place.
The plurality which W. D. Ross held
over Lizzie E. Wooster was increased
in today's returns. These reports in
dicate Ross's renominatlon by 1O.GO0.
Fred W. Knapp has a substantial,
though not entirely safe lead over
' nma urgm. uyr nu Jviapp "

,,,,
Ross Seems To Be Safe.
Only a smashup In the dope from
missing counties can take Payne out
of the lead for treasurer, while the
Ross plurality looks safe in the state
auniHntendent flsrht- Because of the
i Evans strength In western counties,
jPayne iB regarded as more uncertain
than Ross. A number of counties
(known to be strong for the Goodland
jman have not sent their reports 'o To-
j peJJ candidates except Evans have
j reported returns from their favorite
counties. The Eli Payne vote crippled
Miss Lizzie Wooster and prevented her
rh-hl(, rt(.feat of Ross for a third
I nomination as state superintendent of
Fred KnaDD was not regarded as a
contender in the auditor contest. Now
he leads In a fight that was doped as
between Organ and Dyer.
i One of the Surprises.
One of the surprises In the auditor
fight was when Organ lost Neosho
county to Knapp. Neosho is the home
of James Nation and Seth O. Wells,
former state auditors. Organ also
lost Ford county, which went to Dan
Dyer. Ford Is the home of W. E.
Davis, present state auditor, to whom
Organ has been first assistant for six
years .
Shawnee county's big vote for Matt
Weightman put the Topeka man In
the running and is holding him in
second place on returns reported. On
the other hand, Wyandotte county
slipped in the big plurality antici
pated for Wylie W. Cook. On the face
of returns received in Topeka, Cook
will finish fourth. He was generally
doped as one of the serious contenders
for the nomination and several poli
ticians are said to have placed money
on Cook against the field.
Returns In all counties are being
canvassed today. These returns will
be completed late today or Saturday.
Not until the official vote is an
nounced will the result of the fight -in
last Tuesday's primaries be known.
CLOSE ISLES DEAL
Sign Treaty for Purchase of
Danish West Indies.
Expect Senate at Present Ses
sion to Ratify Contract.
Washington, Aug. 4. Acting Secre
tary Polk announced today that the
treaty by which the United States is
to purchase the Danish West Indies
from Denmark for $25,000,000 was
signed at New York :hls morning by
SUPERINTENDENT.
AUDITOR.
Secretary Lansing and Minister Con-
-tantin Brun.
The treaty provides for the trans
fer to the United States of three is
lands St. Thomas, St. Croix and St.
hn which have been the subject of
negotiations betv. eon the United States
and Denmark for many years. It '
understood that the administration
will as'-, for the ratification by the
senate before the end of the present
cession and while there may be some
objection to the price, no really seri
ous opposition is expected. Secretary
Lansing, who has been spending his
vacation at Watertown, N. Y., went to
New York to meet Minister Brun. .
Denmark Faction Against Sale.
Unofficial word from Copenhagen
is that the conservative party which
rejected the proposal for the sale in
1902. is not now opposed to the sale.
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee said today
the opposition to the Danish West
Indies purchase apparently was negli
gible and that he believed the vote to
confirm the treaty would be unani
mous. The only opposition at all was
because of the price, he said.
Under the treaty, the United States
obtains the islands of St. Croix, St.
John and St. Thomas, east of Porto
Rico- It surrenders its discovery
rights in the north of Greenland. The
treaty must be ratified by the Danish
and American governments and the
people of the Islands. The house of
representatives as well as the senate
will have tc ratify the treaty for this
country, because of the money in
volved. From the United States standpoint
the chief gain in getting the islands is
strategic. For European governments J
to hold the West Indies Is considered
to threaten this country's Interests.
U-BOAT MAKES "KILLING"!

CAMPAIGN POT
BEGINS TO BOIL
FIRST OF WEEK
"J. Ham" Lewis to Trail
Hughes on 10,000-Mile Trip.
Then Fairbanks Will Follow to
Rebut the Senator."
BOTH SIDES GALAXY SPEAKERS
Remember "As Maine Goes So
Goes the Nation."
So Both Parties Swamp Maine
With Oratory First.
BY PERRY ARNOLD,
New York, Aug. 4. Next wees, the
real political tumult and shouting will
begin. The opening season for orators
starts Monday. From then on to No
vember the air will be full of ords.
Looking forward today, it seemed safe
to predict that no previous campaign ,
will approach -he one now Just begin
ning to get under way in quantity f -oratory,
amplitude of speakers and
miles traveled by candidates.
Republican Nominee Hughes a(
Bridgehampton today was polishing .
off the drafts of the various speeches ,
he will deliver on his transcontinental
trip Monday. At Washington, Sena
tor James Hamilton Lewis of Chicago,
was conferring with leaders in re
sponse to a drafting from the national
uemocrat:c committee here to "fol
low up" the Hughes trail across the
continent. By the time Lewis finishes
his little 10,000 mile Jaunt behind
Hughes, doing rebuttal oratory. Re
publican Vice Presidential Nominee
Charles W. Fairbanks will swing out
along the same oratorlcally oe&ten
path across the continent In sur
rebuttal of Lewis. All three men will
travel over practically the same ro-jte.
Whether the Democrats will get in
a "last word" all along this same rout
by sending some one to follow up Fair
banks was not made know here oday.
. Beginning with the middle of Au- ,
gust, Maine will hold within her bur- '
ders until September 11, probably the
greatest galaxy of political spellbind- .
ers ever assembled. Both national
parties are mindful of the ancient po
litical maxim, "As goes Maine, so goes
the nation"- and toe. Main election. Is .
on September 11. ,
The Democratic list of speakers for
the Wilson cause in the New England
state Includes five cabinet officers,
four assistant secretaries of cabinet
places; half a dozen senators and eight
representatives. .
Ralph D. Cole, head of the Repub-.
lican speakers' bureau, had not com-
pleted today his list of G. O. P. plead
ersbut It Is known that in addition
to Hughes, the campaigners will prob
ably include Roosevelt, Taft. Fair
banks and a dozen or more prominent
Progressives and "old line" Republi
cans. . Bryan to Campaign.
In the middle west it is considered
likely that Hughes will make a cam
paign trl. through Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Kansas and possibly Missouri
later in the season. The main Demo
cratic orator selected for this partic
ular territory is William J. Bryan.
Political sharps here predict that
President Wilson will take a long trip
and let himself be seen by voters
after adjournment of congress ex
pected by September 1. Vice Presi
dent Marshall is counted to do effec
tive stumping. Probably he will be
requisitioned for most of the "heavy
work."
The Democrats will match Progres
sives against Progressives sent out by
the Gt O. P. as stumpers. Today, the
Republicans announced as the newest
addition to the Hughes ranks, Ray
mond Robins, who was chairman of
the Progressive national convention
and who it was said, had up to yes
terday been listed by the Democrats
as a member of their campaign com
mittee. ITALY HAS BLACKLIST
