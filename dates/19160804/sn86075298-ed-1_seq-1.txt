Charles E. Hughes Formally
Accepts Nomination.
New York, Aug. 1.-In his address
in Carnegie hall accepting the Repub
lican nomination for president,
Charles Evans Hughes said:
"Senator Harding, members of the
notification committee and fellow
citizens: This occasion is more
than a mere ceremony of no
tification. We are not here to
indulge in formal expressions.
We come to state in a plain and di
rect manner our faith, our purpose
and our pledge. This representative
gathering is a happy augury. It
means the strength of reunion. It
means that the party of Lincoln is re
stored, alert, effective. It means the
unity of a common perception of para
mount national deeds. It means that
we are neither deceived or benunbed
by abnormal conditions.
"We know that we are at a critical
period, perhaps more critical than
any period since the Civil war. We
need a dominant sense of national
unity, the exercise of our best con
structive powers, the vigor and re
sourcefulness of a quickened America.
We desire that the Republican party
as a great liberal party shall be the
agency of national achievement, the
organ of the effective expression of
dominant Americanism.
Explains Dominant Americanisms
"What do I mean by that? I mean
America conscious of power, awake
to obligation, erect in self respect,
prepared for every emergency, devot
ed to the ideals of peace, instinct with
the spirit of human brotherhood, safe
guarding both individual opportunity
and the public interest, maintaining a
well ordered constitutional system
adopted to local self government with
out the sacrifice of essential national
authority, appreciating the necessity
of stability, expert knowledge and
thorough organization as the indis
pensable conditions of security and
progress; a country loved by its citi
zens with a patriotic fervor permit
ting no division in their allegiance
and no rivals in their affection-- I
mean America first and America effi
cient. It is in this spirit that I re
spond to your sumumons."
In discussing foreign relations and
appointments Mr. Hughes declared
that the executive had not command
ed the respect of the world by his
conduct of the state department.
Cc;:petent diplomats, notably Ambas
sa(or Herrick of France, have been
retired for no other reason than to
meet partisan demands.
Has Not Helped Mexico.
"The dealines of the administra
tion," Mr. Hughes declared, "consti
iute a confused chapter of blunders.
We have not helped Mexico. She lies
prostrate, impoverished, fairine strick
en. overwhelmed with the woes and
outrages of internecine strife, the
helpless victim of a condition of an
archy which the course of the admin
istration only served to promote.
"For ourselves, we have witnessed
the murder of our citizens and de
struction of their property. We have
made enemies, not friends. Instead
of commanding respect and deserving
good will by sincerity, firmness and
consistency, we provoked misappre
hension and deep resentment. In the
light of the conduct of the adminis
tration no one could uniderstand its
profession in decrying Interference;
we interfered most exasperatingly.
We have not even kept out of actual
conflict and the soil of Mexico is
stained with the blood of our soldiers.
We have resorted to physical inva
sion, only to retire without gaining
the professed object. It is a record
which cannot be examined without a
profound sense of humiliation."
Interference With Huerta.
Reviewing the interference with
Huerta, Mr. Hughes characterized It
as "a vacillating and ineffective inter
vention," and as "the height of folly."
"So far as the character of Huerta
is concerned, the hollowness of the
pretension on this score is .revealed
by the administration's subsequent
patronage of Villa-whose qualifiea.

-whom apparently the administration
was ready to recognize had he achiev.
ed his end and fulfilled what then
seemed to be its hope."
After describing the seizure of Vera
Cruz, Mr. Hughes says:
"We are now informed that we did1,
not go to Vera Sruz to force Huerta
to salute the flag; we are told that
we went there to show Mexico that
we were in earnest in our demands
that Huerta must go. That is, we
seized Vera Cru1 to depose Huerta.
The question of the salute was a mere
pretext."
"Destroying the government of Hu.

revolution. I shall not attempt to
narrate the sickening story of bar.

murder and lust. We were then told
that Mexico was entitled to spill a:
much blood as she pleased to settle
her affairs. The administration vacil
lated with respect to the embargo or
the export of arms and munitions tc
Mexico. There was an utter absence
of consistent policy. P
Recognition of Carranza.
"For a time we bestowed friendshir
on Villa. Ultimately we recognized
Carranza, not on the ground that he
had a constitutional government, bul
that it was a de facto government
The complete failure to secure pro
tection to American citizens is shown
conclusively in the note of the sec
retary of state of June 20, 1016.
"The Santa Yzabel massacre, the
raid at Columbus, the bloodshed al
Carrizal are fresh in your minds
After the Columbus raid we started
a punitive expedition. We scot a
thin line of troops hundreds of miles
into Mexico, bet wccen two lines of rail
way, neither of which we were allow
ed to un e and which we did not feel
at liberty to seize. We were refused
permission to enter the towns. Though
thus restricted the enterprise was still
regarded by the Mexicans as a men
ace. Our troops faced hostile forces
and it is not remarkable that our men
fell at Carrizal. What other result
could be expected?.
"We were virtually ordered to with
draw and without accomplishing our
purpose we have been withdrawing
and we are now endeavoring to safe.
guard our own territory. The entire
national guard has been ordered out
and many thousands of our citizens
have been taken from their peaceful
employment and hurried to the Mexi
can borders. The administration was
to seize and punish Villa for his out
rage on our soil. It has not punished
any one; we went in only to retire and
future movements are apparently tc
be determined by a joint commission.'
Touches on European War.
Discussing the European war and
the maintenance of American rights
Mr. Hughes declared that "national
security demands that there shall be
no faltering with American rights.'
Continuing, he said:
"We countenance no covert policies,
no intrigues, no secret schemes. We
are unreservedly, devotedly, whole
heartedly for the United States. That
is the rallying point for all Amen.
cans. that is my position. I stand
for the unflinching maintenance of
all American rights on land and sea.
"We have had a clear and definite
mission as a great neutral nation. It
was for us to maintain the integrity
of international law, to vindicate our
rights as neutrals; to protect the
lives of our citizens, their property
and trade from wrongful acts. At
least we were secured. We have had
brave words in a series or notes. but
despite our protests the lives of Amer
icans have been destroyed. WhVba

strongest words known to ui lom'.

Words Alone Do Not Court.
"It is not words, but the str-ngth;

use of both informal and formal diplo

cate that position. I am confident there
would have been no destruction of
American lives by the sinking of the
Lositania. Moreover, a firm Auerican
policy would have been strongly sup
ported by our penpli and the opmr

"It is a great mistake to say that
resoluteness in protecting American
rights would have led to war. Rather,
In that course lay the best assurance
of peace. Weakness and indecision
in the maintenance of known rights
are always sources of grave danger.

curity.
Weakness invites War.
"Not only have we a host of re'

never promote our peace by being

should not have found It dialcult to
maintain peace, but we should have

this critical period the enly danger of
war has lain in the weak course of the
administration.

SIEMS, WICKHAM & CO.
GET RAILROAD CONTRACT
The Missoulian is authority for
the statement that Siems, Wick
ham & Co., of St. Paul, have
been awarded the contract for
the construction of the Dixon to
Poison extension of the Northern
Pacific railroad. The bids were
opened in St. Paul on July 24,
and the bid of the successful
firm was accepted on Wednes
day and the contract signed.
This announcement came
through a message from Presi
dent Hannaford and it settles
definitely the rumor that nothing
would be done for at least a year.
Work is to commence just as
soon as a right of way is secured,
which is now well under way.
There is now no reason to fur
ther quibble over whether or not
RONAN AND ARLEE
ARE STANDARD SCHOOLS
According to the report of C. W.
Tenny, inspector of rural schools, for
the state department of education, the
Cold Springs, Lolo, Saltese, Potomac,
Clinton, Bonner, Pattee, Canyon, Tar
get Range, Bonita, Ronan, Arlee, and
Lothrop schools in Missoula county are
wearing the name plate bearing the
words, "Standard School", which State
Superintendent Davee awards to all
schools on the recommendation of their
county superintendents.
The score card by which these schools
are rated takes into consideration the
building, the equipment, the grounds,
the student and community activities,
and the quality of the work done by
the school itself. This makes it nec
essary for the teachers, trustees, pu
pils and patrons of each school to work
together to make their school what it
should be, and when this cooperation
has once been secured, as a general
rule, the rest of the work has pro
gressed quite rapidly..
Base Ball Sunday
The All Sta.s will play the California
Bloomer Girls on the Ronan diamond
next Sunday afternoon, game to start
ot 2 o'clock, sharp.
This will probably be the last game
of the season on the Ronan diamond,
so everybody should attend.
the Northern Pacific will build
the extension which passes
through Ronan. It will be built
just as rapidly as possible and
transportation will have become
a certainty for such farmers as
have waited so patiently for the
coming of the road. There will
be no long hauls for their crops
in the future as in the past and
prosperity with a vengance will
be theirs.
It has been a long fight; it has
taken much patience to keep
cool under the strain and those
who have been instrumental in
pointing out the need of the road
and those who really forced the
management to get busy and
build the extension have every
reason to feel satisfied with their
work.
RONAN ALL-STARS AND
DIXON PLAY WIERD SAME
That was some ball game at Dixon
last Sunday. It was full of tragic
events right from the start and con
tinued until the final man was re
tired. The All Stars went into the
contest in a crippled condiion, there
being three new men in the line up
and the regular pitchers were all
absent. Phil Hull was kept at home
owing to the sickness of Mrs. Hull,
Wood failed to report and B. Hull re
fused to go so it was up to Joe White
to try out his arm which has bother
ed, and pitched 5 innings, retiring in
favor of Ray Turnquist, who finished
the game. The score stood 7 to 4 in
favor of Dixon at the end of the
5th four runs being made off
Joe's offerings in the fifth:. Buell
had been going good and it looked
like they were going to win easily.
Ronan failed to score for two inning
and Dixon increased the lead three
runs and then it seemed to be all day
with the All Stars. These three runs,
however, were scored after three men
should have been out, as Plouff drop
ped as easy pop-up which would
have, retired the side. It was in the
beginning of the eighth inning that
Dixon went to pieces and before the
inning was over the score stood a
tie 10 to 10. Dixon could not get a
man around in either the eighth or
ninth while Ronan added a couple
more and the game was won.
The fans from Ronan got into the
game in the eighth and their rooting
must have helped some as the score
will show. The Dixon boys are a lot
of good sports and stood the gaff
like men anl had it not been that Buell
went "in the air" for just one inning
the result would have been different.
It was simply base ball luck.

ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
WITH AN AIR GUN
While little Tommy Bailey was play
ing with a number of companions Wed
nesday morning he accidentally re
ceived a shot in his foot from an air
gun. Dr. Fuhrer was called and found
the shot imbedded in his foot under a
cord or tissue in such a manner that it
would require the administration of an
anasthetic to remove it, and as in his
opinion that would be unnecessary, it
was allowed to remain. The doctor
probed for the shot but was unable to
get it out.
It seems that the little boys were
shooting at bumble bees and while
searching for another shot or shooting
at a bee, the air rifle was discharged
and Tommy's foot was in range and he
intstead of the bee received the effects
No serious result is anticipated and
Tom will be around as usual in a day
or two.
REPUBLICAN MEETINGS ON
SATURDAY, AUG. 5 AND 12
There will be a meeting tomorrow
(Saturday) evening, at the Round
Butte consolidated school house, at
which time and place Hon. E. II.
Cooney, editor of the Great Falls Tri
bune and candidate for the republican
nomination for governor will speak,
several candidates for county offices
are expected to be present also and
this wll give voters a chance to he
come acquainted and determine whom
they deem best qualified for the
offices.
On Saturday evening, August 12th,
there will be an other meeting held in
Ronan, at which time Hon. Geo. W.
Farr, of Miles City, one of the candi
dates for the republican nomination
for congress, will le present and ad-
dress the people. Mr. Farr is vouch
ed for as one of the best speakers
in Montana and those who attend
will undoubtedly hear a fine speech.
This meeting will be held in Scearce's
Hall.
It is expected that other meetings
will be held before the primaries o0*
August 29, both in Ronan and in
other sections of the Flathead.
Owing to the fact that it has been
impossible to secure the new opera
house the republican meeting to be
held in Ronan on Saturday evening,
August 12, the meeting will be held
in Scearce's hall. More chairs have
been ordered and ample seating room
will be provided for all who may
wish to attend. Remember the place,
Scearce's hall, and the time, August
12.
Mrs. Reed Brackneyof Three Forks,
who visited last week with Mrs.
Hazel Putney, returned home Tuesday
afternoon. Together with Miss Marie
Myers and Justus Rathbone they
spent Sunday at Camas hot springs.
HARVESTING IS
IN FULL BLS
From every direction can be heard
the music of the mower and the
binder. Farmers are busy getting
their hay in the stack and their wheat
in the shock. The prospects are tia.
brightest for record crops of both
and everybody rejoices that two
bountiful crops have been their good
fortune. Last year they had the
best yield ever harvested in the valley
an'd it now appears that the crops of
all kinds this year are good as last
and some predictions places the yield
ahead of last year.
The threshermen are preparing for
an early start and some machines
have already been hauled to the
country so as to be ready to com
mence threshing as soon as the fields
are cut. Last year it was difticuic
for all farmers to secure machines
just at the time desired and many
are anxious to thresh early this year
and avoid the delay they experienced
heretofore. .,
It is stated that several farmers
have already contracted their wheat
crops at $1.00 per bushel,- delivery
to be made at any time before
December 1st. This would indicate
that buyers are anticipating higher
prices or else are speculating o9l th#
future. Dollar wheat always spells
prosperity and no one rejoices any
more than the Pioneer over the fact
that our farmers are to receive that
price for their wheat this year.
TEACHERS ASSIGNED FOR

The following teachers have been
emp oyed and assigned as indicates
in District 28.
Ronan: F. C. Becker, Azelie Sav
age, Peter Hanson, Irene Teagarden,
Hilda Marsh, Anna Rafferty, Barbara
Kain.

Dwyer, Pearl Mayer.
Most of the teachers of the district
have attended Summer School this
year, the attendance being divided be
tween the University of Montana,
Columbia University, and the State
Normal at Dillon. From ad these
points our teachers are reporting a
profitable and pleasant summer.
With the closing of the Summer
Sesion at Missoula a number of the
district's teachers will return to the
Reservation for the interval remain
ing until the opening of the schools
of District 28, which will occur Sept.
11th.
Supt. Logan, who has been engaged
in teaching several courses irk the
University Summer School for the
six-weeks period, spending only
Saturdays in the District during the
time, returns at the end of August
to prepare for the next session. He
says his vacation spent in this way
should be profitable to the district as
he is enabled not only to keep in
touch with best methods and advahc
ed views in education but also to get
acquainted with and select teachers
from a large body of the state's best
tachers.
The fall term begins a little later
than usual this year in order that
more time may be given for the com
pletion of the new buildings, and
also because it is thought that all
children should be able to leave the
fields for school by the tenth of Sep
tember.
Dr. Resner is spending the week in
Missoula in the interest of his can
didacy for county commissioner.
