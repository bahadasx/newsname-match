After statements had been issued
last nip-lit. at both the Smith and Hill
headquarters, the outcome of the Re
publican contest for Congress remain
ed in the doubtful column and indi
cations are that until the official vote
i:; obtained from all the counties, the
contest may be unsettled.
In a statement made at 10 o'clock
last night, Mr. Hill declared he still
is leading Smith by a' most 1300. Mr.
Siniih said that reports forwarded to
him by his friend:-, from various parts
of tli" district show that he is running
1!(K) votes behind Hill with the count
in Ozark. Stone and Taney still out.
In those counties, he said, he expects
to overcome Hill's present load.
Henry S. Wilson of Ava was elim
inated from the contest when the first
reports began to arrive.
In the three counties that are re
ported out, a total Republican vote of
.".000 was polled in the 1012 primary
flection ami fully that many are ex
pected this time. It is possible that
they may hold the key to the situation,
if .nr. Smith's information has been
accurately reported to him.
Mr. Hill outlines in 14 counties of
the district how the pluralities have
gone, in his statement, and shows that
he is' a loader by 1300. His pluralities
are as follows, according to his state
ment: l'.utler, 075; Pemiscot, 500; Now
Madrid, 84; Rip'ey, 2.10; Mississippi.
T.r.O; Oregon. 250; Taney, 100; Chris
tian, 100.
Mr Hill trives the following plurali
ties to Mr. Smith: Howell. 100; Cape,
I.",!); Dunklin, -125; Stoddard. .100;
Douglas, 272; Scott. 63.
In Mr. Smith's statement, he dam
aged Mr. Hill's lead with the an
nouncement of the unofficial count, ex
ad, of the vote in Christian County,
which Hill claimed by 100. The vote
there was Smith. 756; Hill. 7.". I; Wil
."26. This cuts d.nvn II ill's lend
by 122 votes.
In Howell County, Mr. Smith also
rep e led the exact unofficial returns as
follows: Smith, 546; Hill. 41!': Wilson.
',; Howell County was granted to
by Hill by 100 votes, but in
stead he gets it by 127. There are still
live small precincts to be heard from.
In Mr. Smith's statement, he declar
ed that last night he received a tele
gram front Dr. Kerr in the west end
of the district saying that although
all the votes had not been tallied to
make it complete, the unofficial count
in both Taney and Stone counties wi'l
give Smith pluralities.
Mr. Hill declared his reports show
a plurality for himself of 1-00 votes.

FR. MURTAUGH NOT
EXPECTED TO LIVE
Letters 'From Milwaukee Say
Priest Suffers From
Heat Worse.
Followinjr the receipt in the Cape hy
Sisters at St. Francis' Hosiiital, of let
ters trom St. Mary's Hospital in Mil
waukee, it became known vesterdav
that they do not expect ever to see
Rev. Fr. James A. Murtauph alive
tfrain.
Father Murtatiph is in the Miiwa;:-
kee hospital suffering with a danger
ous attack of hardeninrr of lh arteries
and it is believed that h? never v.'.U
survive, and live long enough to re
turn to the Cape, where he was con
nected with St. Vincent's College.
For several weeks previous to his
departure from the Cape, Father Mitr
taugh had been in bad health and on
frequent occasions, he went to the hos
pital for complete rest and mediral
treatment. As the hot weather of the
summer set in the Cape, he determin
ed to go to Milwaukee where, as a
pati?nt at the hospital, he expected to
escape the heat of the summer in tho
Cape, and return to this city in the
fall, virtually a well man.
At the same time that he vent to
Milwaukee the intensely hot wave that
swent over the entire northern part
of tho United States struck Milwaukee.
He nearly was prostrated bv tho in
tense heat combined with tho suffer
ing which he had to endure. On the
first day, according to letters that have
heen received in the Cape, on which he !
arrived in Milwaukee, 20 persons were
kitlort by the heat.
In addition to the hardeniii" of the
arteries. Father Murtaugh also is suf
fering with an organic affection of the
heart. Within the last week, he has
lost ground decidedly rather than im-
pnvo as was expected he would do
when he left the Cape.
Sisters in the hospital in the North
write that he suffers severe sinking
and smothering spells and all the time
is in agony from the nature of his
malady.
Father Murtaugh is known as onr
of th? college's most brilliant men. H
is author of several books and is con
sidered a great pulpit orator. He is
wealthy.
The district bill if it passed the Sen-
ate carried the usual provision bv
which the Federal Government nqv -
nalt of the expense of the Washington
City Government. The House had
struck it out.

Wife of Merchant Seized With

M; an! Mrs. John L. Stout have
goi.-' to S. Louis, whore Mrs. Stout
wiil re-enter a hospital for treatment.
She r.ly ri turned from St. Louis a few
wc ek- airo, af'er undergoing' a serious
operation.
F' r a short time after her return
home, she appeared to he rapidly re
gaining her health. During the early
part of Ja-t week, she was seized with
a cii;'', and since then her condition
has i.(;t boon satisfactorily.
('apt. and .Mrs. Stout departed for
St. Louis Wednesday morning to con
r.ilt Dr. Carroll Smith, a noted sur

six years ago for the removal of a
foreign growth, and the second opera
tion, which Dr. Smith performed a
few weeks airo, permanently eliminat
ed t'e source of her trouble. It is not
behoved that her present illness is clue
to the operation, and her condition is
not c onsidered to he of a serious na

GARDNER'S PLURALITY
ADVANCES TO 40,000
Last 12 Hours Show Lamm Gains
in Country in Swanger
Territory.
St. Louis, Aug. 4. (Friday) Tabu
lations of 144,336 Republican votes
from the cities and 80 counties gives
the gubernatorial nomination to Judge
Henry Lamm by a plurality that will
be from 15.000 to 20,000. Colonel Fred
D. Gardner's plurality over his near-
jest opponent. John M. Atkinson, has
grown in the last 12 hours from 35.000
to J0,000 and there is no reason to
doubt his nomination.
Instead of losing in the country as
the Swanger managers 'predicted.
Judge Lamm within the last few hours
has heen gaining over his opponent
and with but 25 counties remaining to
be tabulated, Swanger is hopelessly in
the rear. Lamm soon will have a lead
of 1000 votes per county over his op
ponent. At Swanger headquaiters, Lamm's
victory has not been conceded and they
are pinning their faith to a big change
when the official count is received f rom
the country.
In the 1012 primary there w ere only
145,000 Republican votes. The count
already indicates that the Republican
vote will be much heavier. The total
Republican vote in the general elec
tion of P.U2 was 217,81'.).
If the R12 primary is taken as a
basis of comparison, the nomination of
Lamm is virtually assured.
With incomplete returns from 8.f
counties and all the cities, the follow
ing is the Republican vote: Lamm,
73,875; Swanger, 522,355; Morris, 12,-
066, and Mclndoe, 5,13!).
Democrats Gardner, 60,060; Atkin
son, 33,837; Roach, 22,358; Lindsoy,
10,148; Houchin, 13.477; Barker, 15,
300; Painter, 6310.
Lamm Strong in Country.
The returns for Lamm and Swanger
demonstrate the unreliability of pre
election reports. Sw anger was the fa-j
vorite in the betting in St. Louis,
v.here Lamm received a pluralty of
22,W6. Estimates that Swanger would
win were based on an estimated plu
rality of 15.000 for him in St. Louis,
and on reports from the state that he
wa.i leading Lamm two to one.
Returns from rural counties, arriv
ing slowly, are reducing the lead
Lamm had in the returns from St.
Loui.;, St. Louis County, St. Joseph and
Kansas City, but Lamm is much
stronger in the country than reports
had indicated he would be.
The returns from the larger rities
which came in yesterday gave Lamm
a lead of approximately 30,000. Such
a lead did not enter into the calcula
tions of Swanger's supporters.
Swanger's supporters said this to
day they had not given. up hope and
believed t&it the vote not tabulated
would show Swanger slightly ahead
of Lamm. At Lamm's headrjuarters
in Sedalia a statement containing an
estimated plurality of between 7000
and 8000 for Lamm was issued.
Returns are still to come from all
parts of the state.
Swanger showed much strength in
Greene County, where he carried 30

There was nothing in the later re

of them will receive is mere guess-
