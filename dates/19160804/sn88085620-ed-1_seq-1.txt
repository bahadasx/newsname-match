FRANK WALSH TALKS ABOUT THE PRESS
"The great need of the present is
an honest, free and unbridled press,"
declared Frank P. Walsh, chairman of
the committee on industrial relations,
to a great mass meeting of workers
in Union Square, New York City, on
July 4. "The privately owned press,
the privately owned newspaper, is in
evitably a corrupt press and a corrupt
newspaper. I throw down this chal
lenge to every newspaper in the
country today. I care not whether
the man who runs the paper is per
sonally honest or not, he cannot have
a newspaper and a press service
where the economic interest of the
man or men who own it are not op
posed to the interests of the great
masses of the people. That selfish op
posing interest forbids the publica
tion of the real news in the interests
of the masses of the people, and
makes the privately owned press cor
rupt. We must have a press of the
people, by the people and for the
people if we are to have laws and
social conditions and government of
, the people, by the people and for the
people."
The basic thought of Mr. Walsh's
Independence Day address was that
the independence of the worker today
is economic independence.
"Progress can only be made," he
said, "from political independence to
economic independence, and industrial
freedom. There can be no free race
unless the workers have absolute pro
tection against arbitrary discharge,
unless they are protected by their own
organized economic power in the
right to a decent living wage is in
their own power. These things are
not a subject for arbitration, but be
long of right to the workers."
He traced the beginning and
progress of political institutions, and
how in the lives of men like Thomas
Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln po
litical independence was grounded on
industrial and social freedom.
"Thomas Jefferson," Mr. Walsh
said, "long before his immortal
Declaration of Independence, set the
issue squarely when he abolished in
the Virginia House of Burgesses the
EVERETT STRIKERS
HOLD A ROUSING
STRIKE MEETING
Union Officials From Outside Points
Bring Assurance of Financial Help
and the Fighting Spirit Is
Aroused to High Pitch
The shingle weavers of Everett and
surrounding towns packed the Labor
Temple to the doors Wednesday night
to discuss the strike situation. Dele
gations were present from Snohomish,
Mukilteo, Marysville, Anacortes and
other places and the whole situation
analyzed.
Among the visitors present were of
ficials from shingle weavers' unions
in the southwestern part of the state,
who came to learn first hand the
status of the Everett strike and to
learn in what way they could best
help the Everett and Anacortes boys
to win their struggle.
The boys have been on strike for
three months and seem as determined
as ever to win and say they can see
no possibility of losing. The Everett
mill men have scoured the country
for weavers and have succeeded in
collecting a nondescript army of mis-
fits who are costing the mill men far
more than it would to pay the union
scale. If the mill men had agreed to
the reasonable wage demands of the
men in the first instance, they would
have saved themselves thousands of
dollars.
Speaking after the meeting to the
J.abor Journal representative, one of
the local officials said:
"Wp had a wonderfully inspiring
meeting and I voice the sentiment of
the boys when I say that the Everett
t wearers have Just begun to strike.
i)ur brothers from the distant parts of
the state who visited us brought us
encouragement and assurance of help
that has put new life into our boys.
The outside weavers realize that we
■are fighting their fight and that
should we lose, their wage conditions
would be in immediate jeopardy. They
1 are awake to the necessity of furnish
ing the sinews of war and have as-
sured us they will finance our strug
gle for an indefinite period.
"When men will strike the way
these men have, live on the barest
old privilege of the eldest born to get
all of an inheritance. When one Tory
pleaded at least to let the oldest son
have twice as much as any other, Jef
ferson declared 'Unless you can prove
to me that one man can eat twice as
much as another man, I deny his
right to twice the necessaries of life
of another man.' The right of men
to start equal and to have equal op
portunities is basic in American in
dependence. It was declared again in
the noble words of Abraham Lincoln,
fourteen years before his Emancipa
tion Proclamation, when he said: 'In
asmuch as most good things are pro
duced by labor, it follows that all
such things of right belong to those
whose labor has produced them. But
it has so happened in all ages of the
world that some have labored and
others have without labor enjoyed a
large proportion of the fruits. This is
wrong and should not continue. To
secure to each laborer the whole
product of his labor, or as nearly as
possible, is a worthy subject of any
good government.'"
Mr. Walsh showed how these ideals
of true independence and industrial
freedom have been prostituted and
have been denied to the great mass
of the working people. To get these
facts of social injustic and cruelty
and of monopolistic incompetence out
to all the people, Mr. Walsh declared
that there must be education through
publicity.
At one point in his address Mr.
Walsh said: "I thank God for the
sublime patience of President Wilson,
which has kept us out of war with
Mexico." He declared that selfish in
terests are attempting to bring on war
with Mexico and that 'the slow prog
ress being made in recruiting is due
to the horror in the American mind
at attacking a neighbor republic
struggling to support starving women
and children."
In conclusion Mr. Walsh declared:
"Today we rededicate ourselves and
our lives to an America in which jus
tice shall be administered and bene
fits distributed to all its people by
the measures of free opportunity and
of service."
EVERETT TO HAVE
CO-OPERATIVE STORE
The Journal has received a pros
pectus of a proposed Co-operative So
ciety to be established in Everett
The co-operative plan as outlined is
what is known as the Rochdale sys
tem, which allows for persons becom
ing members by taking out a share of
stock, and dividends declared on the
amount of purchases per quarter. The
board of directors, we are pleased to
note, contains the names of such well
known progressive unionists as
Brother Olinger, Sam T. Roberts, A.
E. Holmberg and others. Everett is
especially in need of just such a
proposition as a co-operative store to
combat the grocers' association and
the Everett Commercial Club and its
open-shop policies. The shares are $5
each and can be purchased from the
seretary-treasurer, Peter Husby, 215

COL. HARTLEY HAND
PICKS COMMITTEE
I Politics is a "joy forever" in Sno
homish county since "Don Quixote"
Hartley, of Everett, shied his castor
into the gubernatorial ring. The
colonel is death on unions. If he had
his way every "labor agitator" would
be drawn, hanged, and quartered. The
colonel's voice fairly trembles with
rage as he denounces the union offi
cials who are "making an easy living
off the credulity of their poor dupes"
and pleads for the right of the "in
dependent workmaai to work for
whom he pleases." The right of the
independent workman in the case of
the colonel's shingle mill being the
right to work for 50 cents a day
cheaper than the prevailing rate of
wages in other localities."
The colonel is now barnstorming
the state a la patent medicine vendor
with a male quartet and is speaking
daily to thousands of people who re
ceive him as the political Moses of
1916. The colonel admits it, or rather
his press agent does.
A rather good story is related about
the colonel. It seems it occurred to
him and his backers that it would be
a fine thing to prove the falsity of
the proverb that "a prophet is not
without honor save in his own coun
try." So his campaign stationery is
said to bear the names of several
prominent citizens of Snohomish
county, constituting an executive com
mittee. It is related, however, that
the colonel neglected the trivial for
mality of consulting some of the men
whose names were thus used before
they were appointed. Up in Arling
ton resides W. H. Ford, prominent in
the locality and former mayor of that
city. Mr. Ford is a candidate for sec
retary of state against Captain I. M.
Howell, present incumbent. Mr. Ford
was among those names appearing
on the colonel's committee, and Mr.
Ford rather resents the use of his
name without his permission, as the
following letter from Mr. Ford to the
colonel's Everett representative, Mr.
Newton Jones, would indicate. In
parenthesis it might be stated that
Mr. Jones is general superintendent
of the Clough-Hartley mill in Everett,
a strike-bound plant, and is at present
engaged in the pleasant pastime of
being major domo over a bunch of
strikebreakers. Here is the Ford
letter:
Newton Jones,
Everett, Wash.
Friend Newton: Your letter advis
ing me of my appointment as one of
the executive committee on Col. Hart
ley's campaign club was received this
a. m. I wish to thank you for the
consideration, but owing to our dif
ference of opinion relative to the
labor question, and the fact that I am
a candidate myself, I wish to forego
the honor and ask you to take my
name from your list.
Respectfully yours,
(Signed) W. H. FORD.

In adjusting matters with the of

LIEBKNECHT CALLED
JUDGES COWARDS
Attacked Court for Shutting Out
Public at Trial—Workers
Struck in Protest
| The following cable to the New
York Globe and Chicago Daily News
by Paul Scott Mowrer appeared re
cently in the Globe:
Paris, France. —(Delayed.)—French
Socialists have received reliable de
tails regarding the recent trial and
condemnation of Herr Lleberknecht,
the Socialist leader in Germany.
When the public prosecutor asked
that the public be excluded, Lieb
knecht exclaimed:
"Gentlemen, you are powerful, but
you are afraid. You tremble at the
effect my poor words might have on
the public and on the prudently
chosen journalists. You who have
at your disposition a force of police,
an army, cannon, everything. It is
cowardice on your part, gentlemen.
Yes, I repeat that you are cowards
if you close the doors. You should
be ashamed of yourselves."
Nevertheless, the court decided to
exclude the public. Then Liebknecht
shouted to his wife and Rosa Luxem
burg, in the audience:
"Leave this comedy, where every
thing, including even the judgment,
has been prepared beforehand. Go
away."
"When the crowd waiting on the out
side heard the verdict, shouts arose:
"Our Liebknecht has been condemned
to two years and a half imprisonment.
Long live Liebknecht!"
The next day between 50,000 and
60,000 workers in the munitions fac
tories and especially in the plant of
the General Electric company, struck.
The manager of the electric concern
asked to see a delegation from the
strikers. He told them that no po
litical strike would be tolerated and
that strikers would be tried by court
martial, but he added that if they
wanted a wage increase the company
would consider it. The men did not
ask for any increase, but, after a
few days, the strike ceased, owing
to opposition by Socialists and Syn
dicalist leaders.
Still, there was great discontent
among the masses, and some agitat
ors have even been advocating a gen
eral strike. The Berlin newspapers
have been forbidden to publish the
fact of the arrest of Rosa Luxemburg.
She was arrested in the military zone
and can thus legally be kept in prison
without trial until the end of the state
of siege. The news of her arrest,
however, was spread by word of
mouth throughout Germany.

CLOAK STRIKERS BEGIN FIGHT TO SETTLE
WORKERS PLEDGE RENEWED LOYALTY TO UNION CAUSE
The striking Cloakmakers ot New
York resumed their fight against the
manufacturers' association in the
same orderly manner that has marked
the thirteen yeeks of their struggle.
The disorders of the day before ap
peared to have been nothing more
than a nightmare. Those who had
cursed and reviled their officers most
on the preceding day were most
friendly yesterday and loudest in their
pledges to work for unity in the
strike.
President Benjamin Schlesinger, of
the International Ladies' Garment
Workers' Union, and Morris Hiilquit,
counsel ef the union, gave out the fol
lowing statement:
"To the Public: In order to clear up
certain misapprehensions which may
arise as a result of the rejection of
the proposed agreement by the mem
bership of the Cloak Makers' Union,
the undersigned desire ot call the at
tention of the public to the following
facts:
"The instrument rejected by the
workers was not intended to be an
executed agreement, but was adopted
by the conference merely as a mutual
recommendation to be submitted to
the membership of both organizations
for ratification.
Didn"t Favor Contract
"The representatives of the workers
in the conference at no time favored
the arrangement which abolished the
machinery for the adjustment of
grievances and for the enforcement of
the agreement and relegated the par
ties to the uncontrolled exercise of
the arbitrary whim of the employer,
with perpetual shop strikes as the
sole corrective. The workers' repre
sentatives in the conference time and
again warned the employers that such
an arrangement was not calculated to
bring lasting peace to the industry,
but. on the contrary, would throw the
latter into a state of constant strife
and chaos. They submitted to the ar
rangement largely because they were
anxious to terminate the disastrous
strife and put an end to the suffer
ings of the 40,000 working men's fam
ilies involved in this struggle.
"The striking workers have em

New York.—Director of the Bureau
of Standards Tirrell says an unskilled
laborer's family of five persons can

wages that fall below $840 a year.
He has studied this question and now,
as a practical application of his be
lief, he recommends that no minimum
rate below that figure be established
in the street cleaning department for
unskilled laborers, stablemen, host
lers and drivers.
GARMENT WORKERS GAIN
Cincinnati. — Garment Workers'
union No 100 reports success in en
forcing its new wage scale, which pro
vides for higher wages and better
working conditions. A large propor

Olympia, Wash. —Trade unionists in
this state are endeavoring to secure,
through the referendum, the repeal
of a so-called "anti-picketing" law,
passed by the last legislature.
Legislative Agent Hughes of the
State Federation of Labor says the

not do. the national law says the
workers may do," under the labor sec

agreement, feeling that they would
rather expose themselves to con
tinuous privations than to return to
work under an arrangement which to
their minds means only a temporary
and dishonorable truce, and inevitable
oppression and strike in the end.
"The officers and representatives of
the union know that the action of the
workers was not prompted by an un
reasoning desire to continue a war
fare full of hardship and suffering for
them, nor by a spirit of blind rebel
lion, but by a deep conviction that the
agreement offered to them was op
posed not only to their own interests,
but also to the welfare and peace of
the industry. The union officials ac
cept the verdict of their constituents,
and will continue the struggle until a
fair and equitable arrangement is
made which will secure justice to the
workers and peace in the industry."
Schlesinger and Hillquit issued the
following statement to the members
of the Cloak Makers' Union:
"You have rejected the proposed
agreement between the union and the
manufacturers' association. This was
your good right. The argument was
only adopted tentatively, and with the
express provision that it would be
submitted to you for acceptance or
rejection.
"The strike is therefore still on.
Your officers and representatives ac
cept your mandate loyally and with
out reservation, and will make every
effort within their power to lead the
just and courageous struggle of the
workers to a victorious conclusion.
"The main responsibility for the
success of the strike devolves upon
you. It is vitally important that the
strike be continued in the same well
disciplined, orderly and dignified
fashion in which it has been con
ducted during the last three months,
in spite of all provocations and priva
tions. All personal feelings and dif
ferences of opinion must be buried for
the sake of the great cause which
unites us all in this hour of crisis.
Our organization must be more solid
and harmonious than ever before. All
committees and members must per
form their duties with increased zeal.
From now until the final hour of
victory, let every man be on his post."
' LOOK-OUT LEGISLATION
IS PERMANENT THING
With the toilers in the local post
office department already badly over
worked, the new post office of Ev
erett is being equipped with a speed
up and spy system. This action is
being taken under the provision of
the sundry civil appropriations bill in
congress, which specifically provides
for "look-outs" in twenty-one post of
fice buildings.
Under the legislation now pending,
these look-outs will become a perma
nent feature of the government's la
bor policy. The workers thought
they had achieved somewhat of a vic
tory' when they succeeded in putting
a stop to the practice of constructing
these spy galleries without specific
authorization through a liberal inter
pretation of the word "repairs" in the
post office appropriations bill.
Recently the controller of the treas
ury ruled that look-outs come under
the head of improvements, not re
pairs, and must be specifically legis
lated for.
Soon thereafter, however, the pres
ent bill was pending in congress,
which provides $67,700 for twenty-one
look-outs in as many post offices
throughout the country.
A post office look-out most com
monly is a secret gallery in which in
spectors hide and make "unobserved
tests" of the quantity of work done
by employes. This sp#\ing usually
succeeds in speeding the workers up
to the point of exhaustion throughout
the day.
