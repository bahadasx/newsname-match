Equity Exchange
Suit Dismissed
Linde Says Action Dropped Be
cause of Lack of
Funds.
Bismarck, August 4.—By stipu
lation between Henry J. Linde,
•attorney general for North Da
"kola, and Judge Munn, attorney
for llie Equity Cooperative asso
••cialion, the action asking for dis
solution of the equity has been
dismissed without prejuidice
.Linde says the action was dis
missed because of lack of funds,
••appropriation for expenses incur
red by the attorney general's of
fice having been exhausted. Fur
thermore, the offer of wealthy di
rectors and stockholders to make
any impairment found in the
capital and assets of the corpor
ation removes any cause lor ac
tion.
No Other Course Open.
''As long as stockholders arc
•satisfied with the financial condi
tion of the corporation, there ?s
i«o olher course but to dismiss
the action whicli was started to
protect small stockholders," says
the attorney general.
The suit was started more than
two years ago when stockholders
petitioned ft he a'^orney general
to restrain the officers from sell
ing stock, alleging the concern
was insolvent.
Court Room Packed.
The case was heard before
Judge Pollock. The court room
was packed during the trial and
demonstrations were kept down
Avilh difficulty. Several personal
encounters occurred. One be
tween the late George Loflus and
a Moorhead attorney, in which
the attorney came out second best
will be remembered for some
time.
The court ruled that the state
had failed to prove its case and
declined to issue a restraining
order. The state claimed that in
order to prove its case it would
have to examine the exchange's
/books. This they claimed they
'had been unable to do because
the officers of the concern had
refused access to its records. The
attorney general asked that the
court compel the Equity to show
its books. This was also refused.
Appeal to Supreme Court.
The attorney general appealed
to the supreme court in the mat
tor of the Equity's books and this
tribunal reversed Judge Pollock.
While the matter was in the
supreme court, members of the
exchange got busy and sold slock
among the farmers of the stale
and put that organization on a
rirm basis.
Girl Says She Saw
One of the Men
Identifies Photograph of Neavels
As Man She Saw Near
Park.
Bismarck, N. D., August 4.—
None of the three men who es
caped from the penitentiary Sat
urday has yet been captured.
Traces, however, have been dis
covcre.d of W. H. Neavels and
Mack McGee, the two leaders of
the eight who escaped July 23.
W. D. Dopking, state parole of
ficer, returned today from inves
tigating the report that the two
men were seen near a cave south
west of Lark on the Mott line of
the Northern Pacific July 24 and
2"» IffifH'W*.*
None of the men living in the
neighborhood had got near en
ough to the couple to tell what
ihey looked like, but their action
IIley suspected that they were un
desirables.
Two children, however, acci
dentally ran across them when
they were going one way around
the hill under which the cave is
built and the men the other way.
They were within 100 feet of the
men when they saw them. The
negro, believed to be McGee,
wheeled quickly and walked out
of sight. The white man, believed
to be Neavels, stopped, made
faces at the children, scaring them
so that they ran home.
Mr. Dapking showed the pic
tures of the escaped men to the
children and they at once picked
out Neavels as the white man, but
could not identify the negro.
Trails were found -where the
men had gone to milk the cows
and to get vegetables from the
garden. A makeshift bed was
found in the cave.
The nearest any man got to see
the men was when the farmer liv
ing nearby tried to see them with
the glasses. They saw him and
immediately turned their backs
and walked to the other side of
the hill.
S L. Olson, member of the
board of control, will arrive to
day from Stanton. James A.
Brown, resident member, and Mr.
Olson will go at once to the pen
itentiary to see the warden.
It will be of interest to those
who are interested in homesteads,
relinquishments and ceased In
dian lands to know that on Tues
day next W. A. Sprague will
leave with a number of men whom
he will locate. He tells us that
has mighty good Indian land for
sale at from $8 to $15 per acre,
terms to suit purchaser, and that
he can also secure relinquish
ments or homesteads for a large
number desiring to homestead.
He says the land is A No 1 agri
cultural land and that it behooves
those interested to get busy at
once as it wiH l^a|l,gone in the
near future!'
27 Die From Pa
ralysis in One Day
NeceSsary to Call for More Hos
pital Beds to Care for
Afflicted.
New York, August 4.—All pre
vious mortality records in the ep
idemic of infantile paralysis were
broken here today when it was
reported that 57 children had died
during the 24 hours period end
ing at 10 A. M.
Health^ commissioner Emmer
son found it necessary to call for
additional beds in the hospital to
care for the afflicted.
Only 150 Beds Available.
The number of new cases re
ported in the greater city was li9
and it was said that only 150 of
llie 2,438 beds available in public
and private hospitals remained
unoccupied tonight.
The total number of cases is
more than 4,000.
Must Have Cool Weather.
While health authorities assert
they have the situation well in
hand they admit that unless cool
er weather sets in the number of
cases probably will be increased
by several thousand before the
epidemic stage passes.
In a good old fashioned game,
one of the kind in which scores
are numerous, the printers of
Beach'took the lumber, grain and
coal dealers into camp last Sun
day to the tune of 23 to 13. The
dealers in these several commodi
ties started the game with a bang,
getting three scores in the first
inning, but persistency on the
part of their ink-besmeared op
ponents finally wore them down
until they were practically help
less. Markus occupied the slab
for the "prints" and had "thirty"
on them at every stage of the
game after the first inning. It is
generally conceded that the vic
tors are out of the ordinary ama
teurs and several other aggrega
tions are being formed for the
purpose of wresting the cham
pionship belt from them.
Rev. H. T. Rauh of Billings,
Montana called on Rev. Treink
lein last Tues. Rev. Rauh has cov
ered the territory from Billings to
Beach and also founded the local
German Lutheran 'congregation,
lie marvelled at the wonderful
progress made by the city of
Beach and his former congrega
tion.

Attempt to Wreck Safe Unsuccessful Evidently Work of Amateurs
Who Were Frightened at Noise Made by Explosion
Some lime between 0:30 last evening (Friday) and seven o'clock this (Saturday) morning yegg
nu-n, or rather would-be yeggmen, forced their way inlo the Farmers Supply Store and attempted to
blow the large safe there.
They gained entrance by breaking the lock on the front door and tried to get inlo the safe by
by breaking the combination off with a sledge hammer and then imning fiitroglycerine in the
hoic left when the combination came off. The explosion failed to wreck the door, however, and it
is thought that the noise it made frightened them and they made their get-a-way.

"Were the water at thai point

railroad men today that the 350,
000 members of the four great
brotherhoods of railway trainmen
