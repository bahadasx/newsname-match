Straus Says Attitude nf Third
Avenue President Caused
the Trouble.
PROMISED TO ARBITRATE
And Then Left for liurope,
Leaving I lis, Subordinates
Without Authority to Act.
At the hearing this afternoon be
fore the Public Service Commission
Into the circumstances lending up to
the present trntTIo situation Chairman
Straus ot the commission said:
"I think that from thn testimony
doveloped wo have arrived ut a Hilnt
where this Commission Is Justified In
making it preliminary summing up
und recommendation.
'It appears that President Whit
ridge of the Third Avenue Company
In 1913 reached an agreement with tho
men of tho Yonkers and Westchester
lines that ull differences which mlgh
urlso should bo arbitrated. Thtro ap
pears to he no dispute that tho men
on the Yonkors nnd Westchester lines
not only wero ready to arbitrate but
naked tho opportunity to nrbllrate tho
present differences.
"It appears from the testimony of
General Manager Maher that Presl-i
dent Whltrldgo forgot this agreement.
A resolution of tho board of directors
on Juno 26 placed power exclusively
In tho hands of Mr. Whltrldgo to deal
with tho men. Mr. Whltrldgo having
gone to Europo July 15, when tho men
enmo Inter to deal with Mr. Maher
ho found himself not nblo to deal
with tho situation.
"It was this that precipitated. If It
did not cause, the strlko un the Yon
kers nnd Westchester lines. Then
camo tho efforts to organize the mon
on tho Third Avenue system, efforts
accelerated by the strlko giving th?
Yonkers nnd Westchester men oppor
tunity to organize tho Third Avenuo
system,
"There In no question that the strike
on the Yonkers nnd Westchester
roads and Third Avenuo lines nnd tho
threatened strike on other lines In
this city is duo to tho attitude and
action of President F. W. Whltrldgo
of the Third Avenue lines. It provos
that cither ho intentionally violated
tho agreement he mail o with his men
to arbitrate, or that ho was so negli
gent of his duties as to forget his
Agreement to arbitrate.

President nnd General Manager of

The last chance of settling the traction strike without a tie-up of alt
the surface lines of the city vanished this afternoon when Vice-President
and General Manager Medley of ilie New York Railways, failed to com
ply with the request of the union leaders that he answer their demands by
3 o'clock. n
In a letter from Medley, replying to one from a committee of the
employees reiterating the demands, received at union headquarters about
2 o'clock, there was no reference to the company's intentions as regards
the demands. Instead, the letter asked the men to meet Medley at 4
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, not as representatives of the union, but as
employees of the New York Railways Company.
Thin further refusal to recognize tho union means that the union
lenders will curry out their plan to call out the men on tho 1,291 green
line curs at 1 o'clock fo-nuiriow morning, this decision being reached
earlier In tho duy.
The 500 motormen and conductors
