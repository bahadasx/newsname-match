Tazewell chapter U. D. C. met at
the home of Mrs. A. J. Tynes Tues?
day afternoon, an unusually large
number of the members being pre?
sent, and a very interesting program
being rendered. Mrs. C. A. Thomp?
son read of the engagement of the
Merrimuc and Monitor; Mrs. Mattie
Spotts brought some photographs of
Gen. R. K. Loo, Mrs. Lee, and Mary
Custis Lee, on the backs of which
were personal notes written by the
originals.
The Chapter wishes to gather as
much history and personal remin?
iscence of Tazewell as possible, and
will greatly appreciate the informa?
tion. The yearly election of officers
was held, resulting as follows:
President, Mrs. C. A. Thompson;
1st. Vice-President, Mrs. A. G. Ki

The following paper was prepared
by Judge S. C. Graham for Mrs. Lucy
H. May, and read by her at the an?
nual meeting of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, on August 1st.,
liM'i:
I take for my subject, from the best
information I can get, the names of
the gt.llant officers who fought in the
War Between the States and who were
natives or residents of Tazewe'l
ctunty.
GENERAL JOHN B. FLOYD.
General Floyd was Secretary of
War when the war between the states
b.-gan, and was charged with fur?
nishing arms to the South; and no
doubt, from what I have heard, he
did so. After the War began, he held
the commission of Brigadier Gene?
ral. He was not accredited as being a
great general. He scarcely can be call?
ed a resident of Tazewell county, or
"Tazcwellite," although he and his
people- lived in Burkc's Garden for
many years.
COLONEL TITUS V. WILLIAMS.
He was a graduate, or certainly a
student, for some length of time at
the Virginia Military Institute. After
li'ling various minor olllcus in the
Confederate nrnty, he became a com?
missioned Held officer in the 37th.
Virginia Regiment, which was com?
manded by Colonel Samuel V. Ful
kerson at the time he was killed.
After iho death of Colonel Fulkerson.
Williams arose to the rank of Colonel
of that regiment. He was wounded
several times, once very seriously,
while in the campaign of the eastern
army. He was a native of Tazewell
county, and went west some time after
the war, where he practised medicine
for several years, and died recently.
He was extensively connected in Taze?
well, his mother being a Gillespio.

League Organized to List Poor Pay
Debtors.
A representative of the National
Rating League is in the city interest?
ing the merchants and professional
men of Tazewell in organizing a lea?
gue for protection against the poor
pay debtor. The work is similar to
Bradstreet & Dunn. Where Bradstreet
& Dunn protects the wholesale house
against the poor pay merchants, the
League protects the merchants and
professional men against the poor pay
debtor. Thus each merchant and pro?
fessional man can turn to a book of
credit guido and see if ono is worthy
of credit. The system will save all
merchants and professional men from
getting heat any more by people go?
ing from one store to another, or from
ono town to anotor to got rid ofpay
ing their just debts. However, it is
impossible for any honest person to
get his name on the list, as each deb?
itor is given a chance topay an ac?
count before his name is published.
The system is covering the entire
United States. It does not matter
where the debtor moves, he cannot
(Escape this hook unless ho pays his
debts. The National Rating League
has boon in business 18 years and has
rendered valuable service to the busi?
ness and professional men throughout
the United States, and is endorsed in
every state in the Union. A largo
number of Tnzowell men have joined
this League. The Red Guide will be
issued in 4 months from dale and will
he in the hands of every business man
in the country. It will contain the
names of all persons who refuse to
pay an honest debt.
My Heart's Desire.
I cannot but think God must know
About the thing I long for so;
I know He is so good, so kind,
I cannot think hut Ho will find
Some way to help,somc way to show
Me to the thing I long for so.
I stretch my hand?it lies so near;
It looks so sweet, it looks so dear.
"Dear Lord,"I pray, "oh, let me know
If it is wrong to want it so."
He only smiles?He does not speak
My heart grows weaker and more
weak,
With looking at the thing so dear,
Which lies so far and yet so near.
Now, Lord, I leave at Thy loved feet
This thing which looks so near, so
sweet,
I will not seek, I will not long??
I almost fear I have been wrong.
I'll go and work the harder, Lord,
And wait till by some loud, clear
word
Thou callest me to Thy loved feet,
To take this thing so dear, so sweet.

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE
WELCH MASONIC LODGE.
Whereas: It has pleased our Most
Excellent Grand Master to remove
from our midst our beloved Brother,
George W. Litz, and while wo how in
helpless sorrow to his will, we ap?
preciate that this loss will weigh
more heavily upon those who were
nearer and dearer to him?those who
were bound by more than fraternal
ties; those to whom the loss of his
intim&te companionship und manly
protection will be felt more than
words can tell; ami
Whereas: In the death of Brothel
Litz his family has lost an affection
ate husband; a loving parent and a
loyal brother; the Lodge an ardent
and enthusiastic member; and the
world one in whom all could place
their trust without fear; therefore be
it
Resolved, That McDowell Lodge No
112, A. P. & A. M., extend to his
afflicted family its sincercsl sympa?
thy, and as words seem empty, can
only express the hope that Cod may
lighten their sorrow, and alleviate
rheii- grief, in the recollection of tin
fact that Brother Litz was a man
among men in whom there was no
guile?ono who enjoyed the uilboudll
ed confidence of all who knew him;
and bo it further
Resolved, That as an outward tok?
en of our sorrow, and apprcviation
which we have in our hearts for the
many good qualities of our deceased
brother, that the lodge rooom of Mc?
Dowell Lodge No. 112, A. F. & A. M.,
be draped in mourning for a period
of thirty days; and be it further
Resolved: That a copy of these res?
olutions be presented to the family
of our deceased brother; that they be
spread iipon the- minutes of the
Lodge, and bo printed in the Mc?
Dowell Recorder and the Clinch Val?

GEORGE W. LITZ.
E. H. Witten's tribute to ono whom
ho loved?
Grundy, Vn., Aug 2.
When the motor cars collided at
Gastonia, N. C., and caused the death
of George Litz, ho did not lose. Ik
was only called to those mansions
whose walls enclose unutterable hap?
piness and eternal rest. But the peo?
ple?the great common people of
Tazewell, McDowell, and Buchanan
counties?received a staggering blow.
He was in th prim of manhood, with
every expectation of life, was filling
a useful and honorable career and his
future was bright and promising.
The sudden death of this noble flaxen
haired boy was a rude shock to
strong men and appalling to surviv?
ing friends.
I have known and been intimately
associated with him since early boy?
hood and he has been a kind and
courteous friend whose warm henrt
and cordial hand always gave sincere
welcome.
lie brushed aside the cheap, dead
stuff called formnlity, and placed his
warm hands on the shoulders of man?
kind in a friendly kind of way. To
the voice of sorrow he gave a willing
ear, and took up the burdens of others
as cheerfully as if they had boon his
own.
Of nil the goat characters of South?
west Virginia that have impressed
their individualities upon our local
history, none will be cherished with
a more ardent and enduring afTection
by our mountain people than George
W. Litz.
"He never made a brow look dark,
Nor caused a tear but when he
died."

TAZEWELL
'DUTCHMAN' ON
THE WAY HOME
German Submersible Has Ap?
parently Eluded Enemy War?
ships, and is On Way With
Rubber and Nickel Cargo.
Washington, Aug. 2.?The tug Tho?
mas P. Timmins, which accompanied
the German submarine Deutschland
down the bay from Baltimore, re?
ported to the United States neutral?
ity squadron outside Hampton Roads
tonight that the Deutschland had
passed out of the Capes at 8:30 p. m.
The Timmins' message was picked
up by the destroyer Sterrett, which
relayed it to Hie Norfolk navy yard.
The destroyer then was outside the
three-mile limit to see that the sub?
mersible':; passage out was not inter?
fered with by the allied cruisers off
the Capes until she had passed out
of the territorial waters of the United
States.
Coin Through Capes.
The commandant of the Norfolk
navy yard sent the following to the
navy department:
"U. S. S. Sterrett reports: 'Sub?
marine reported by tug Timmins to
have passed out the Capes at 8:110.
Am outside three-mile limit.'"
While the Sterrett's report did not
mention the Deutschland by name,
navy officials hud no doubt that the
reference was to her. The Sterrett,
with three other destroyers and the
armored cruiser North Carolina, it
was pointed out, were doing neutral?
ity duty otf the Capros with a par?
ticular view to preventing violation
of American territorial waters in con?
nection with the Deutschland'8 de?
parture.
Homeward Pound.
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 2.?The1 Deut?
schland, the giant German submar?
ine, cleared the United States shores
?it 8:.'!() tonight, apparently unobserv?
ed by hostile craft, and now, so far
as is known here, is safely homeward
hound.
No untoward incident marred the
departure of the Deutschland shortly
before nightfall. She was accompa?
nied only by her lug and a newspa?
per dispatch boat. She began the
eighteen mile dash from Cheesapeake
Hay to the Virginia Capos, which
ended about two hours later wdion
her last light blinked out in the
gloom.
None of the allied cruisers which
had been waiting to intercept, the
submarine sealiner, nor the United
States neutrality ships which have
been pat l ulling the neutral line so
closely recently was in sight at the
time of the submarine's departure
from the capes.
Clear Path. Ahead.
Whether she submerged before
reaching the throe-mile limit is un?
known. The night was dark and a
heavy sea was running. Hence it was
impossible to discern her movements
.it the distance she was from the two
nccompnnying boats. They only know
that she disappeared unharmed, and
Lhat to all appearancces she bad a
clear field ahead to a point where
she could completely submerge inj
safety.
Within half an hour after the last
light of the Deutschland had disap?
peared her tug, the Thomas F. Tim?
mins hove into sight, seemingly satis?
fied with her work, and headed up
Chesapeake Hay i the direction of
Baltimore.
It was from that city yesterday that
the Deutschland cleared with a cargo
of rubber, nickel and possibly gold,
23 days after her sensational arrival
in American waters from Bremen.
Bremen Overdue.
The Bremen, sister ship of the
Deutschland, ns rumor bad it, would
arrive here with the Deutschland'8
departure, thus far has not appeared.
The Deutschland started for the
capes after arriving early today at a
cove up Chesapeake Bny, where she
remained hidden.
For several hours prior to the be?
ginning of the Deutsebland's final
dash for the capes she was hidden
near Tangier Island, about fifty miles
above Cape Henry. The steamer Som?
erset and the government bouy ten?
der Ivy reported that they had passed
her at that point. The press boat
then took a position near the dividing
point of the Old Point and Cape
Henry channels and awaited the com?
ing of the undersea vessel.
It was shortly before C o'clock that
the first sight of her was obtained.
Apparently she was about five miles
away and was low in the water, only
her conning tower showing. The Tim?
mins was a short distance behind
her, nnd they wero running about
seven miles an hour.
Avoids Press Boat.
When near the entrance to Mob
jack bay the Deutschland sighted the
press boat and immediately revers?
ed herself and appeared to he making
for the bny. After running for about
two miles she again headed south,
until she was abreast of the Timmins
and then both vessels put on full
speed ahead toward the press boat.
Suddenly near the press boat they
turned ofT as if to go down the Old
Point channel, but, upon the dispatch
boat making for the same channel,
they changed their course and headed
directly for Cape Henry.
As the Deutschland came on it was
apparent that she was carrying false
superstructure, slightly lower than
her conning tower. It was strnw col?
ored, and blended with the oilskin
coats worn by her crew who crowded
tho deck. When about a mile from the
press boat, tho submersible began to
VIRGINIA, FRIDAY, AUGUS1
clear away the false superstructure
and took soundings as if prepared
Jo dive. Just as the false superstruc?
ture was entirely cleared away, the
Timndns moved ahead of the under?
sea liner and signalled that they in?
tended to pass on the starboard side.
Immediately both vessels increased
their speed and put over to the star?
board.
Shortly before 9 o'clock the Tim
mins signalled the Deutschland that
she had a clear path, and the sea
freighter quickly hastened down the
channel and to sea.
MRS. ELIZA GILDERSLEBvB

Mrs. Eliza Gilderslcevc, aged 71
years, wife of Dr. J. R. Gilderslecve,

ed by her pastor. Rev. Mr. Greer, and

Just 48 years ago, come next Oc?
tober, that is to say, in Octobeer,
1HC.8, Dr. John Robinson Gilder?
slcevc and Eliza Witten were united
in marriage at the home of her fa?
ther, Dr. Raleigh Witten, at. Pisgah,

tion of her health, has resided with
her sister, Miss Martie Witten, as
staled.
PUBLISHERS PACING SERIOUS
SITUATION.
New York, Aug. 1.?Publishers of
daily newspapers in greater New
York at a meeting this afternoon,
took action which will result in the
decrease of the number of pages of
morning, evening and Sunday issues,
of 121 pages weekly. The reduction
of so many pages is a step to relieve
the news print situation which is re?
garded by the publishers as very ser?
ious. Action was also taken to elimi?
nate returns of unsold copies.
Washington, Aug. 1.?Charges that
the price of news print paper has
been run up exorbitantly by a com?
mission of manufacturers were made
by publishers and denied by repre?
sentatives of the manufacturers at a
hearing here today which concluded
a legislative inquiry into the problem.
, Frank P. Glass, vice-president of
the Americnn Newspaper Publishers'
'Association, told the commission he
was "morally convinced" there was
collusion nmong the manufacturers
and expected to be able by October 1
,to present legal proof of it. P. T.
Dodge, president of the International
Pnper Company, declared present
high prices were due to an enormous
increase in demand and insisted that
the manufacturers were not making
a fair return on thlr cnpitnl.
The commission undertook the in?
vestigation under direction of a con?
gressional resolution and will begin
work immediately drafting a report

Vexatious Question Hud
Host Re Settled Now.
New York. Aug. l.?Charles E.
Hughes twice today declared himself
in favor of nn amendment to the fed
|Cral constitution grunting the vote to
women throughout the United States.
In n letter to Senator Sutherland, of
Utah, sent, in response to n telegram,
Mr., Hughes stated his porstmal view
(hut the proposed amendment should
ho submitted by congress to the stales
and ratified. In n speech late today
before COO women of the Women's
Roosevelt League for Hughes, the
nominee declared tho question was
one uNecliug tho whole country and
that ho favored "taking (ho shortest
cut to its solution."
"1 believe this question should bo
promptly settled," Mr. Hughes said.
"1 see nothing but danger lo our se?
curity, to our unity, to our proper at?
titude toward political questions, in
continued agitation of this subject."
Assails Administration.
In his address to (ho league Mr.
Hughes again assailed the adminis?
tration for its policy concerning Am?
erican rights abroad during tho Eu?
ropean war.
"There is an incurable defceel of
character in the administration with
respect to the weakness and vacilla?
tion which have characterised it,"
Mr. Hughes said. "And wo cannot
expect improvement from that, source.
Wo can judge by what has boon done
and by what has not boon done; and
wo are hero together under circum?
stances very unexpected to mo lo see
if wo cannot have a genuine revival
of American sentiment so (hat we may
face the world erect and prepared."

PAR AGRA PS.
Farmers wore? com pol led lo make
liny during July while (ho sun didn't
shine.
Tho Bremen, no doubt, considered
discretion the belter part of valor, and
is waiting to see how the Deutschland
expedition turns out.
The intrepid (some call him fool?
hardy), commander of the submers?
ible Deutschland, put out. from Balti?
more on Tuesday afternoon on his
homeward hound voyage, not with
standing a cordon of battleships were
watching for him on the outside. Will
he get. homo? Whether he does or
not he has demonstrated that, he is a
brave, courageous, patriotic man, and
wo cannot hut wish him hon voyage.
Ho deserves success. A hero he will
be regarded, whatever the outcome of
his perilous undertaking.
So, Mr. Hughes bids for the suf?
frage vote by declaring in favor of an
amendment ot the constitution grant?
ing female suffrage. Ho has moved up
a notch higher from his original po?
sition. Mr. Wilson favors woman suf?
frage, but believes the question should
he loft for the legislatures of the
states to settle as they may deem
host. After all, this woman suffrage
business may be a boomerang. The
liquor vote of the nation is sure to ho
solid against the candidate who fav?
ors universal suffrage. Mr. Hughes
may yet wish ho had not played this
political, vote-getting card.
