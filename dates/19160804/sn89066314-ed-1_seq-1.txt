"I am beaten. That is all there is to

to carry by a heavy vote have returned
small majorities for me, while in the
large cities where I expected an even

figure that outside of St. Iuis and
Pettis counties he has some 25,000
against 20,000 in my favor. Both of
these counties have been carried by
Sulivan. After all it seems 1 am not

I started out boldly. I was going
to travel through the pike at the fair
from Creation to Revelation. For rev
elation it was with a high percentage
of "revel." I hesitated at the first
booth. I eyed the man behind the
counter. He caught me looking. I was
lost. With a wild sprint he started
on the most enticing (get-rich-nuick)
talk that has ever been presented to
me. Why. for ten cents I could win.
Yes. I could win by merely pushing a
little stick through a paper-covered
hole. I punched. Hurray, he said I
won. And not until then mil I nac
vaguest notion of what it was 1 could
win. While pondering over this, the
genii behind the counter handed me a
big doll. I recovered a little later,
sneaked off to the side, buried my
winnings, rubbed off my dazed look
and swore revenge. But I had won.
Sees the Khe-I.eifgcd Mule.
Had it not been for the megaphone
on the box. I would have missed the
chance of my life time to sec the
"greatest, most unusual, the only liv
ing (accent) PIVK legged mule. Yes,
A five-legged mule; pronounced by
the President of the Cnited States
(pause) College of Veterinary Science
to die a week after its birth, but
through the marvelous efforts (pro
nounced eff fawts) of its owner the
impossible has been accomplished.
(All this while swinging a cane). And
now the mule lives with five perfect
ly formed legs (even the picture de
nied this), and can run faster than
anyone. But the megaphone was
quick, and the privilege to see the
wonderful "ani-mule" and mine (for a
dime).
I was hard and experienced at the
end of the first round. I was richer
by two collar buttons, three pencils
an instrument that does everything
hut give milk, and six cigars. I call
them that, for they were cigarly shap
ed, of cigarly material on the out
side, and had a suspicious cigarly
smell.
Buries Some More Winnings.
I innocently asked for a match, bit
off the end and and lighted it.
Pleasantness faded into indifference,
indifference into puzzling, into sus
picion, suspicion into a slight dis
agreeableness. I buried the rest of
my winnings.
I had learned to fish, throw rings,
pitch arrows, chuck baseballs in a
bucket, at dolls, at slats, at stuffed
owls and duck pins, and at a negro's
head. The men behind the counter
took so much interest in my inability
to throw straight, were so solicitous

Ah! Madam Fortune-Teller. Before
I could say a word Madam had me in

Tnl.es a Long Trip Buck to Toiin.
She then told me I was going to
make a long trip. I asked her if she
meant the walk from town to the
fairgrounds. She was not sure. She
hastened to tell me, also, that I was
going to take a few more long trips.
I told her she was right, as I was
going to "cover" the Fair tomorrow
also.
I suddenly told her that I had five
automobiles. Note: I have used the
jitney buss twice when jitney meant
5 cents). She smiled and rubbed
my palm and said she could tell that
easily by my hand.
When the ordeal was over I con
sented to tell her fortune for a dime,
but she said she needed the money
to pay for the rent of the tent and
"toxo." Supporting a "real Egypt

me.
I was still working out the plans
for educating my five children when a
man with a big box threw his arms
out in intense excitement and scream
ed in my ear that I could have a pic
ture of myself in two minutes and
three seconds. The seconds appealed
to me and I was about to consent
when he came over and said he had
taken my picture. A few minutes la
ter he handed me a picture and asked
for a dime. I told him a picture of
someone else was not worth a dime
to me, and he assured me that it was
my picture I was paying for. I didn't
like to argue. He seemed so sure.
