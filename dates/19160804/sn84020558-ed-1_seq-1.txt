bit ween the Russians and Teutons, while in the Caucasus region the Rus
sians near Oiarbekr carried out a bayonet attack aqainst the Turks which
resulted in the capture of a Turkisli work and some 3000 prisoners and
Puns.
In the Travananzes vsllcy or t:ie Austro-Italian theater, the Italians

LONDON, Auk. 4. The Italian mail
steamer Lctimbro has been sunk by a
mbmarine and 2S survivors have ar
rived at Malta, says a Renter dispatch
fr.nn that place. Two boat loads of
survivors also have arrived at Syra
cuse. The Letimhro carried a crew of 57
and her passengers numbered 113. It
is believed that a large number of
them lost their lives. The passengers
included women and children.
Survivors report that a submarine
was observed at a distance of about
VuuO meters. It filed a warning shot
and then gave chase, firing continu
ously for half an hour. It finally over
took the Lctimbro, which had begun
to lower boats.
"The submarine." adds the dispatch,
"continued its bombardment, smash
ing five boats, the occupants of which
perished. Some of the survivors say
that many were killed by shell fire."
All the Italian crew of the brig Ito
balio, torpedoed by an Austrian submaJ
rine, have arrived at -Malta.

have reached London in the past, the

August 1 said that German Zeppelins
in their raid over England on the
previous night bad readied London.

statement Issued from
bureau tnniglit says:
An official
the press
"The government carefully and re
peatedly considered all the circum
stances in the Casement ease before
reaching a decision not to interfere
with the sentence. t
He was convicted and punished
fur treachery of the worst kind to the
empire. He had served as a willing
igent of Germany."
After declaring that Casement had
organized German assistance for the
Irish rebellion, the statement con
tinues: Conclusive evidence has come into
the hands of Ihe government since the
trial thai he had entered Into an
agreement wilh the German govern
ment, which explicitly provided that
the brigade which he was trying to
raise among Irish soldiers, held as
prisoners, might be emploved in r.gypt
against the British crown. Those
among the Irish soldiers who resisted
Casement's solicitations of disloyalty
were subjected to treatment of excep
tional cruelty by the Germans. Sonre
of them since have been exchanged
as Invalids ami have died in this
country, regarding Casement as their
murderer "
In conclusion, the statement points
out that the suggestion "which nas
teen conclusively disproved," that
Casement went to Ireland to try to
stop the rising, was not raised at the
trial, nor was the plea of insanity.
Two hours before the execution of
Casement at 9 o'clock this morning
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates. At
!) o'clock the crowtl hail swollen to
such proportions that it extended fo
two blocks from the w-ison front.
At one minute after nine a singli
stroke of the big bell announced tha
the trap had been sprung. It was the
signal for a mocking, jeering yell from
the crowd, which suddenly died away
into dead silence.
Karlier In the morning two priests
if the f toman Catholic church admin
istered the last rites in the cell of the
condemned man. and shortly after
wards, a little procession, headed by
the. clergyman, with Casement follow
ing, and a warden on either side, pro
ceeded toward the execution shed
only five yards away.
As the party reached ine sneo
where the gallows was erected, the
special executioner, a hair dresser
named Ellis, approached Casement
and quickly pinioned him. Casement
mounted the gallows firmly and com
mended his spirit to God ns he
stepped on the trap. A moment later
the lever was pulled. Casement was
pronounced dead at nine minutes
after 9.
Outside the prison wall, as the ex
ecution was in progress, was a group
of about thirty Irishmen and Irish
women. When the bell announced
that Casement had paid the last pen
alty, this group fell on their knees in
silent prayer for the repose of the
soul of their dead fellow countryman.
Casement showed not the slightest
concern over his fate. On June 29

WASHINGTON, Aug., 3. The final
word from General Carranza neces
sary to initiate organization of a
joint commission for settlement of
border disjMjtes is expected to reach
Washington in a day or two and of
ficials believe the commission's de
liberations may begin within a week
or ten days.
Official announcement in Mexieo
City today that Mexican commission
ers already had been selected was
taken as a sign that the American
suggestion broadening the scope of
subjects to be considered at the con
ference probably had Deen accepted.
While no formal comment was made
at the department there was nothing
to indicate that the three commission
ers named, Messrs Cabrera. Bonillas
and Pa mo. would not be entirely ac
eeptaolu to department officials.
President Wilson has a score of men
under consideration for appointment
as tli American representatives but
it is understood he' had not made a
choice.
There are many indications that a
higli army officer will be one of those
selected by the president because of
(the military problems. Major Gener-
ial
Gcjethals has oeen mentioned. Tha
other men under consideration in
clude members ef the supreme court
and men in close touch with com

Department officials have refused
to discuss what maters in addition to
the military situation on the border
they desiro the commission to treat.
It is known, however, that the pos
sibility f arranging financial aid tor

The commissioner's power will be
