Perkins Lectures
Postponed J ,
Owin to the oppressively
bot weather and the short no
tice, we with Mr. Perkins agree .
that a later date than Aug. 15
17 would be preferable. So
that he suggests late in Sep
tember or early in October if
he can get away from his offi
cial duties, would be preferable
to an earlier date. 'We will
give ample notice of the lec
tures, with time and place.
, Porter Speaks '
A good crowd met at the court
house last Thursday to hear Dudley
Porter present his claims for the
nomination. Whether he was nom
inated Thursday we do not know,
but can say his speech here
showed him to be a strong man and
he received the congratulations of
friends and made votes by his able
speech and genial manners. -
Death of Rev. J. G. Anderson
, In the rush of matters last week
we neglected to record the death of
Re7. J. G. Anderson, who died at
Memphis and his remains brought
to Falcon cemetery, where they were
laid to rest with that of other kin
dred. ' Mr. Anderson had been in failing
health for some time. Bright's dis
ease had reduced the once robust and
stately form to a frail skeleton.
The deceased had for the past 20
years done much effective preaching.
He clung tenaciously to 'the Cumber
land church after the Union, but he
ceased as a minister ' for several
years, for reasons we do not know. -
Ha was' our friend for many years,
' and we offer our condolence to his
widow and one surviving son.

Selmer's Great Poultry Interests
That Selmer is the biggest and best
poultry and jegg market in West Ten
nessee, is conceded by all who know
the enormity of the business that is
being done by the Selmer produce &
Supply Company, of this place.
This one firm has shipped heavily
loaded cars of poultry averaging one
car per week this year and expects to
ship 52 carloads during the year 1916,
or an average of a carload per week
for the entire year. n"'T-'. ,
' The excellent service these people
get over the Mobile &' Ohio railway
allows them to pay prices for poultry
that cannot be duplicated by parties
, living on other lines; as a carload of
poultry leaving here on Saturday at
2:30 pan. is unloaded in Chicago Mon
day morning at 7:00 p.m. ,
When these cars are loaded with
full grown chickens and other poultry
they usually contain 6,000 fowls.
W hen a full load, of young.ones , are
. shipped It takes 10,000- head for-a
carload.
These cars carry from 15,000 ; to
v 20,000 pounds and costs between
$2,0Q0.id $3,000 to boy carload.
"This ! is 'governed, bowever, by the
price paid. In addition to this, this
firm (has averaged approximately 3
carloads 6f eggs ever two weeks.- A
carload of eggs contains about 200
cases and costs from $1,000 to $1,500
to buy them.
This firm has paid out from January
1st up to this date $85,000 for poul
try and eggs, which certainly speaks
well of this section of the country as
a poultry and egg locality and alio
shows that we have some live busi
ness men here, and they have the
capacity for handling goods on
large scale.

Sunday School Convention
The McNairy County and West
Hardin County Sunday School Associ

Adamsville on the 22nd. inst., and
held its sessions for two days in the
M. E. Church South.
The County Officers, G. M. Goocb,
President, and H. P. Wood, Secretary,
were present from first to last.
The attendance of Delagates and
workers from the body of the County
was light but the interest was keen.
Judge Joseph Carthal, State Sec
retary of the Tennessee Sunday
School Association was present from
the first and his fine S. S. map of
Tennessee with his lucid explanations
of the map and of different phases of
the Organization and its Standards
were very helpful. Indeed, it would
be almost impossible to maintain .any
degree of efficiency in the organiza
tion without his part of the work in
annual conventions of the county. "
Rev. J. D. Canaday of Henderson,
an enthusiastic worker devoting his
entire time to Sunday School work
under the American S. S. . Union, was
also present from the first and gave
some very valuable discussions as well
as one Btrong speech. " '

now engaged in an evangelistic meet
ing at the Christian church at Adams-
villa, attended every session, as did
also Rev; J. . Jones of the Methodist
Church, South of Adamsville, and
both contributed to the success of
the meeting. Brother W.;A. Overton
of the Presbyterian church of Adams-
ville was only present the first day,
beiug under the necessity of attend
ing his appointment away from town
on Sunday.' . -
There were 15 delegates from as
many schools attended and there were
written reports from 15 schools, repre
senting about an average - daily at
tendance of some 767 Sunday School
pupils. '
The report of the County Secretary
showed that a systematic plan has
been pursued in the past year to edu
cate Bible School, workers along the
ines of the State Association Stand
ards by holding District Conventions
with uniform programs, placing many
Banner School Charts . with schools
and explaining by sundry speakers at
the District meetings, the ten points
of this chart, and .furthermore using
the District Chart and explaining its
place and utility in the organization

wice Examined and Each Time
Was Told Operation Would Be
Only Hope. i
"I have just finished my third bot
e of Tanlac and have gained twenty-
seven pounds," was the truly remark
able statement made by Mrs. Charles
eden, residing at 550 Mill street,
Huntsville, Ala. Mrs. Peden is one of
the best-known and highly respected
women of that thriving little city,
where she has made her home for a
number of years.
"When I commenced taking the
medicine," she continued, "I only
weighed ninety-eight (98) pounds;
now I weigh 125 pounds, and never
felt better in my life. For years I
have suffered with a bad form of
stomach trouble,' constipation and
pains in my sides and back. At times
the pains took the form of torture
and I was twice examined and each
time was told that I had appendicitis
and that an operation would be my
only hope. I had fallen off until I
only weighed ninety-eight pounds and
was so weak I could hardly get
around. .
"I had no appetite at all scarcely,
and what little 1 did eat would cause
gas to form in my stomach, which
gave me palpitation of the heart,
sick headaches and a dizzy feeling
about the head. When these spells
came on me I would get awfully ner
vous. I worried about myself until I
could rest and sleep but little.
I had fallen off and was almost
skin and bones.' and my strength and
energy were slowly leaving - me. I
had a dread of the future and could
see nothing but the operating table
and knife. I had a perfect horror
for an operation, but had made up my
mind that it was either life or death,
and prepared to submit to it. J had
made all preparations for the opera
tion and called on my Bister to tell
her good-by, as I did not know wheth
er I would live to seo her again or
not. My sister begged and plead
wh me not to allow them to cut on
me and told me to wait and try a
good tonic for a while. The nextdiy
as I returned from the consultation
room I thought of what she said, and
ap I heard so much about Tanlac I
decided to try it as a last resort and
stopped at Gilbert's Drug Store and
got a bottle. Of course. I had lost
heart and had no faith in the medi
cine, but to please my sister I made
up my mind to take it, and, oh, what
a happy day that was for me!
"I never returned for the operation,
but just kept on taking the Tanlac.
night from the start I began to feel
better. The medicine seemed to take
hold right at once. ' It had a sooth
ing effect, and in a few days I felt no
pain at all. I was so happy over the
wonderful improvement in my condi
tion that! sent for my neighbors' to
tell them how much better. I felt I
sent and got another bottle of Tanlac
and have just finished taking my third
bottle and feel like I have been made
all over again into a new woman.
As I have said before, I now weigh
125 pounds, and my improvement has
been so rapid that none of my clothes
are big enough for me. I will have
to make them all over again. I now
have , a ravenous appetite and my
husband says I am simply eating him
but of house and home. I have even
gone back to my coffee, which I was
told not to touch. Those terrible
pains in my back and head have all
disappeared and I sleep like a child.
I am no longer nervous, and when I
get up mornings I feel refreshed,
cheerful and bright. -I am now able
to attend to my household duties, and
I feel as if I had started life all over
again. My husband is highly delight
ed, and my recovery is the talk of the
neighborhood. I do nothing but re
joice all day long over the recovery
of my health and praise Tanlac to
everybody.
"I feel so grateful for my escape
from the operating table and the
knife that you may publish what I
have said; you may, If you wish, tell
other women suffering as I was, to
come and see me and I will be glad
to tell them all aboot my case."

The Wise Saying of a
Great Business Man
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, but
when you get a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really entitled to an itemized
statement of his account with each purchase. The Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does he want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keeps both posted.,
Take the wise saying of the great business man; .keep
your good customer by famishing him with an itemized state
ment of his account. Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted.
The McCaskey Register
will do this; why not buy one?
