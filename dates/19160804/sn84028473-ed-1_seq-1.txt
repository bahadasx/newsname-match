Mr ILaFollette decisively and vigor-
ously endorsed rresiaem v ueuu
And the reason for it is shown in
anothei point which he made- which
was indeed bis principal point and one
in which the American common peo
ple ought to take an active interest
Senator La Follette said I sincere

Making
1000 Per Cent
on a 200
Investment
Q
ETTING returns on the money expended
is the distinguished mark between an ex
penditure and an investment
If you can place your money where it will re
turn to you a cash dividend of five hundred per
cent it is a good investment isnt it
What then about a trifling outlay which will
return a dividend of one thousand per cent in
health in wisdom in increased effectiveness
in inspiration in enjoyment in all those things
which go to make life worth living
You can make a thousand per cent investment
today
The Chautauqua committee has a limited
number of season tickets to sell at 200 apiece
Every ticket opens the doors of opportunity
Every dollar spent for these tickets is an in
vestment not an expenditure
A two dollar ticket brings a five day vacation
to your door It provides entertainment which
is restful lectures which are informative in
spirational exhilarating music which is beaut
ful ennobling It brings a tonic bath for tired
nerves a rejuvenating elixir for jaded brains
The Chautauqua program is a program built
by experts who have searched the markets of
the world The music entertainment and lec
tures included therein arc the finished product
of master intellects
For two dollars you get what your forefath
ers could not have bought with the wealth of a
Midas the concentrated effort -of a thousand
minds correlated by the organizing genius of
modern business
For two dollars you get the finished product
of the life of master musicians consecrated to
your service since birth You borrow the gifted
brains of noted lecturers to search the libraries
of the world
For two dollars you get a masters degree in
the Peoples University the canvas college
which is remaking America You get inspira
tion and encouragement for renewed endeavors
which mean increased effectiveness and earning
power You get money value plus power
And over and beyond the selfish increment
to yourself the two dollar investment which
you make in a season ticket brings the conscious
ness of association with the sort of thing which
is making your home town a better place to live
building citizenship in the young increasing
business zeal and civic pride multiplying oppor
tunity for all and buttressing every good thing
dn fhe community with solid helpfulness
Two dollars spent today enrolls you with the
Chautauqua Boosters and puts you in line to
receive the thousand per cent dividends in vim
vigor and joy-of-living which the Chautauqua
pays
Do it today
