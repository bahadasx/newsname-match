that It waa In th. hands or a mistress
of th. art or violin playing. It was
followed by several other .tecee by the
nam. artist, each number rectvi:g a
delightfully hearty encore. The young
lady's playing was a revelation to all

ful to the musicians present. Home cf

played easily, gracefully and with a
sweep of the bow and a toucn t the

seven years old who was evidently
much friKhtened and acted like she was
trvinr to ret away. Mr. Vanhooee
thinking something was wrong Caught
the little girl and held her until he
could flag no. . believing that she In
some manner had rotten off the train
or had been left. The train had stop
ped by this time and the conductor
came on the platform to see what was
the matter. The colored porter of the
Pullman entered the sleeper, which at
that time resounded with the screams
of on. of the women passengers who
declared that her child had been lost
or was stolen. Th. excited child, how
ever, restored peace to the woman who
.ieclnred that she did norknow how the
child had gotten off the train. "All's
well that ends well" and the train
moved eastward without further Inci
dent. It la believed that the child
might hav. been walking In her Bleep
and was only aroused by th. noise of
the stopping train.

ON THE PERSON WEIGHER
A. C. McClure, of Iula, certainly
got th. Toledo Person Weigher into a
j lot of desirable prominence ' at Terr.
! Haute recently. Terr. Haute Council
' U. C. T. gave a May fentiial, which
. was well atteaded by members nd their
wives. Mr. McClure had a person weigh
jer on hand and all the ladies, at their
'respective places, were given a card
I showing the name and address, with a
space for the weight. Later on they
j were weighed on the person weigher
and an adding; machine added the
tweightes up. They then divided the to
jtal weight, which was about 12,000 lbs.
j by the number weighed which gave an
average of 123 lbs. The lady who
weighed exactly this recelv-d the first
prize, and the ones weighing nearest
above and below that amount received
second prizes. Then there waa a prize
for the heaviest, 203 lbs. and a prize for
the lightest, 88 lbs. The newspapers
In commenting upon th. affair, con
ceded that th. stunt ons of the best
and most original ever pulled off by
th. local Council of the U. C. T.
This la certainly th. way to stir up
Interest In th. person weigher and Mr.
McClure is to be congratulated upon
his enterprise, upon his originality and
upon th. ability which he displayed in
putting the new Idea across.
REDUCTION IN PRICE8 OF

Th. Ford Automobile company an
nounced oh August 1st a reduction In
the price of their cars.' The five pas
senger car la now I3S0 at Detroit ,n
atead of $440. The freight la ad.ied
to whatever point th. machines are
shipped.
This anouncetnent came Ilk. a claj
of thunder from a clear skv. The pres
ent p.-ic of everything that enters in
to th. making of these cars wss sup
posed to be sufficient reason for the
price remaining where It was. The
Ford company has a rulj of keeping
Its plans absolutely secret aa to prices.
and when a reduction Is coming, not
even their agents kn j v anything atx.ut
it until the announcement la made on
th. day th. reduction takes place. If
an announcement were made In . ad
vance that th. pricw . would b re
duced on a certain dat. there would
b. a cessation of orders. This Is their
reason for this rule, Th. new prices
are guaranteed against a reduct'en
fur a year, but not against an advance

CflAUTAUOUA PASSED
UP LOUISA ENCACEMENTi
BECAUSE OF SMALLPOX IN FORT
GAY, AND OTHER J
OBSTACLES
P. T. Barnum was considered some
showman in bia day, but be has been
out-distanced by the modern artist
the fellow who though out the scheme
of selling to small towns what he calls
a Chautauqua. Barnum bad to take
chances on receipts; his was not a!
sure thing. It's different with this I
fellow's show. He slips up on the !
Kli nH -iA ,.T ... . ...
: r JT "
gum mum:,, wuu uavv uui uu wi-
ting up nights studying Chautauquas
at least not from the business end.
The smooth advance agent talks more
about "boosters' . than about Chau
tauquas. He is loaded with booster
buttons and booster pennants and
booster banners. H. gets a list of re
liable citizens and proceeds to arouse
their "boost" Instincts. It's a hope
lessly dead on. who hasn't soma civic
pride tucked away somewhere about
his person. Th. business of th. ad
vance agent is to touch the aforesaid
c p. and start his victim's boost germs
surging through his system. Then,
at the psychological moment, get
his autograph on the dotted line under
an iron clad contract guaranteeing the
showman's price for what h. has to
offer snd no questions asked as to
quantity or quality. A one-horse show
it is very likely to be. But what does
Bat-cliff care. If be sells half the
small towns in th. United States only
one In his life-time at his own price
be hasn't lost a fortune.
But what w. started out to say was
that th. three days' Chautauqua ad
vertised for Louisa for last Friday,
Saturday and Monday was . compro
mised and called off. A case of small
pox happened along Just at the right
time, travelling with another aggra
vation of entertainers, and stopped
over In our neighbor town oi r on
Gay. Of course It . would not be
neighborly or brotherly or sisterly to
hav. our first Chautauqua show when
our sister city waa laid up in th. pest
house and Itching to be with tut- So
for this reason alone, be It understood
the show man accepted on. hundred
dollars of real United States money
from the score of citizens who guar
antee that everything win turn out
all right, and everybody holding a
son ticket gets a rain check or his
money back. It cost the committee
only four or five dollars apiece to see
th. "Exit." but they all appear to be en-
loving It. They are glad It didn't
cost five time, that amount.
On. of th. boosters suggests that a
moonlight school be organized to study
all the hazy scheme "before taking.1
Preparedness Is the real thing nowa-
daya. The Chautauqua will get you
If you're not fortified.
But to get away from th. light vein
in which the above wss written, the
committee of good citizens labored
hard to give the town this attraction,
and they deserve much credit for their
etforts. The advance sal. fell so far
below th. cost of the course, and the
fear of a smallpox epidemic; resulted
in giving- It up.
A SEWING BEE
Last Friday the handsome home of
Mrs. F. T. D. Wallace waa blight with
a bevy of pretty girls arrayed in their

the hostess complimentary to her nieces
Misses Mary Emily and Martha Rus

the pleasant affair was so so and not
sew sew. but that mattered but little,
for the pretty Misses bad gathered for
the purpose of having a good time,
which they surely had. There was
music, vocal and instrumental, very
much conversation in lighter vein and
the refreshments were all that could
possibly b. desired. The rooms were
beautifully decorated, the dominant
colors being yellow and white. By us
