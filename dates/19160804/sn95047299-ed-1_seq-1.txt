EH SCHOOL WINS
iii mm mm
Several Hundred Thousand
Votes Were Cast for the
Several Contestants.
The Library Contest in this city
closed last Saturday evening at '.)
o'clock, but the race was so close
I among some of the organizations that
! every ballot had to be counted to dc
! terniine the winner.
The beautiful library and sectional
1 book case go to the Palatka High
: School. They polled o8'J,705 votes,
! winning over the other contestants
; by a plurality of 192,181 votes over
the Palatka Public Library.
I This contest which began sixteen
, weeks ago, started off easy, but as
; the count was published from week
! to week showing the standing of the
numerous organizations which wore
i in the contest, the interest deepened
until it included thousands of zeal
1 ous pupils of the schools and ardent
: members of many churches, lodges
and other organizations each bent on
winning the prize for their favorite.
The work of the school children was
especially systematic and earnest.
! The merchants and business firms
all seem to be highly pleased with the
: results obtained from the contest and
: we feel safe in saying that this eon-
tc-t has brought the merchants in
Palatka who gave votes, very much
business which otherwise they would

public library was 3l)7.."2(.

this city.
P; wi'l be remembered that some

the head of Water street. It is a

Moiuhiy.
"Say, but I'm glad to get here," he
breezed. "Chicago is hottcrn 'El
I'uso; I haven't been us comfortable
in many a week as I am riht now
here in old Palatka. Have a cigar,
ilow you :. g'ettin' on, old boy?"
Under his arm Mr. Sice; carried a
morocco bound volume which he pro
duced and opened. It contained pho
tOKraveurs of the front and side ele
vations and diagrams of a combina
tion bookcase, phonograph cabinet,
writing desk, ar.d commode, etc.,
which Mr. Sieg explained he had in
vented during his idle hours in the
"Windy City," and on which the Pat
ent Office had just issued him letters
patent.
There photographs showed the pat
ented contrivance to be a most beau
tiful piece of furniture. It is col
lapsable can be folded up and can
be easily shipped. It holds a pho
nograph on top and has a place for
records, with the advantage that the
1(1 cent records can be used. The
whole beautiful piece of furniture can
be made and sold at $15 retail.
While in the city Mr. Sieg gave
one of our manufacturing concerns
an opportunity to fiugre on a contract
for manufacturing these cabinets, i
and it is more than likely that Pa
latka will again profit in a substantia!
way through its luck in coming in
contact with Chas. II. Sieg.
Mr. Sieg is essentially a promoter
a live wire who electrifies every ,
person with whom he comes in busi
ness contact. lie has already seen '
some of the great department stores j
and mail order houses of the country
and these have assured him that they i
can be relied on for orders up into the .
thousands. They recognized it in
stantly as a rapid seller something
which" only needs advertising to ere- ;
ate an instant demand. !
Mr. Sieg remained over night at
the Putnam House, returning to Chi- j
cago the following day.
The Atlantic & Gulf Insurance

In a telegram received by Mr. N.
E. Shontz on Monday, President C. S,
Barrett of the National Farmers Ed
ucational and Co-operative Union of
America, gave his approval to the
plans for holding the next National
Convention of the Union in this city,
and President Barrett has designated
the third Tuesday in November as
the day of meeting.
Li the meantime Mr. Shontz, who
has been appointed State Organizer
lor the Union, is busy organizing
branch unions throughout the county,
ile has already organized branches at
East Palatka, Orange Mills, Palatka
and Peniel and has every good pros
pect of lining up the farmers and fruit
growers all over the county in the or
ganization. Ile hopes to make this
i ection into a great centre of workers
for the welfare of the organization,
so that when the convention meets
here with its hundreds of delegates
from all parts of the United States
that will feel as if they were indeed
among friends.
Mr. Shontz is a live wire; he is a
practical farmer and knows the needs
of the men engaged in that work.
President Leeks, under resolution
of the board of trade, has appointed
his central committee to take charge
of the general plans for entertaining
the big convention. Mr. Leeks him
self by virtue of the resolution be

this reason Palatkans will rejoice at
its enlarged field of operation.

Rev. P. Q. Cason closed a six year
tei in as pastor of the First Baptist
church in this city last Sunday, when
faiowells were said. The pastor
preached at both the morning and
evening services and before large
congregations.
It was at the evening service when
the presentation of the silver service
was made. It was a beautiful set
Mid the pastor's voice trembled as he
feelingly accepted this final token of
the esteem in which he has been held
by he congregation.
( bily an evening or two after the
Ladies' Aid Society met with Mrs.
R. A. Thomas, where a social time
was held and delicious refreshments
served by the hostess assisted by
Mrs. E. Loomis. Here it was that
the retiring pastor was presented
with a solid leather traveling bag
from the society, and in the bag was
a present from each individual mem
ber of the society.
The same afternoon the society i
elected new officers for the ensuing :

Norfolk. Va., Aug. M The German

passed out of the Virginia Capes at
!s:.'!0 o'clock Wednesday night, appar

known here, is now safely on her

Now it doesn't seem possible that
Alderman Austin is the real starting
point in all this aldermanic discussion
designed to discredit Palatka's munic
ipal water supply.
The question that most of us would
like to know is: Who has been
piimpin' all this hot air into him?
To whom does he go to get his nerve
bolstered to the point where he will
slam and seek to discredit such an im
portant public necessity as the water
which enters into the" domestic life
of the city, thereby helping the city
on the road to financial suicide?
Surely Austin isn't the source of all
this rant.
The matter was brought up again
in council last Tuesday night by
Austin. Ho and his committee want to buy
tae Old Palatka Water Works. Ho
said it could be had for $(iO,000, which
did not include the SrJO.000 suit
against tho city.
Mr. Austin appears to be stuck on
Lie old water; it is soft by nature.
He has gone "bug house" in his ani
mosity to the city water because it
is made soft artificially, and the pro
cess is corroding the boilers and
mains.
He wanted a straw vote of the
people, and he secured the passage of
a resolution whereby the city clerk
was to draw up a petition to 'be pre
sented lo each tax payer (which by
the by does not include Alderman
Austin) by the chief of police, to see
how the people feel toward the prop
osition to buy the old Boston water
plant for ?fi0,000, and if possible as
certain how they would vote nn n
bond issue for that purpose.
Alderman Jarrett opposed the prop,
osition, but in spite of his sensible
opposition the resolution was carried.
The chief is now out with the pa
per. Many are refusing to sign;
more are saying no to the bonding
proposition; a few are saying "yes."
But when ail is over where wiil we
be at? Just where we started from.
Now what is the matter with Pa
latka's municipal water supply?
Since the softening process was es
tablished it is as pure a water for
domestic purposes as can be obtained
anywhere in this world.
And as for the corroding process
said to be going on in the pipes, due
to the soda ash used in the softening
process, why. it isn't going on. Al
derman Austin has been misinformed.
If Alderman Austin wanted to do
the city, which as an officer he has
sworn to uphold, a service, he would
go to first hands for his information,
and not to those enemies of the city's
water system who have selfish de
signs in discrediting the water sup
ply. The city water plant is with us to
stay. The time to fight it ended
with its completion. It possibly was
a mistake when the city decided to
provide it. Many of our very best,
most patriotic citizens thought so
thru, and have never seen a reason
for changing their minds.
And yet these same citizens know
that if this petty opposition of inter
ested parties was withdrawn, the city
of Palatka would have a water sys
tem that paid dividends such as would
materially reduce our city taxes, and
that those who are constantly being
scared away from it would be using
it internally and externally both for
their bodies and their boilers, and that
neither would be injured by the indul
gence. Water Purity Essential.
Is the water supplied by the old wa
ter company pure? The State Board
of Health says it is not. There may
be higher authority, but The News
would not know where to look for it.
