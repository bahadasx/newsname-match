The Clever Weaver Bird.
An interesting bird is the "weav
er." It seems to be fond of mak
ing enormous nest merely for the
purpose of exercise in the art of
construction. Supply these birds
with strings and straw, and they,
will use them up rapidly, and their;
fabric is woven with a perfectnes?
that is astonishing. In some coun
tries it is the custom of the weaver'
birds to colonize and build one bi
flat topped platform, two or three1
yards across, which is so admirably,

Ii Vsitors to Indiana Fair Will See the
New Cars Months Before They Are
Shown Elsewhere.
The greatest autumn automobile
11 show in the United States is that
j staged by the Indianapolis An torn o
1 bile Tradft association and it will bo
diana state fair the week of Sept. '4.
It w.U bo 011 the same inammtth
scale whidi has characterized it for
the last two years and it will display
the motor cars for l9i?moDths before
they are exhibited in the winter
shows.
Tho.big motor show at the Indiana
fair has established itself as the great
est autumn exposition of its kind m
the country. Practically every promi
nent make and model is represented,
including touring, roadsters and closed
cars, and with them are to be seen the
great array of tires and other acces
sories. Never in the history of the motor
car industry have these vehicles
reached such perfection as those that
are being made for next year. Four,
si.Vj,. and twin-six motors, electric start
ing and lighting, clover leaf and other
seating plans, and luxuriant appoint
ments and graceful designs that wrero
unknown two or three years ago make
the cars for 1917 a revelation.
The motor show gives especial ad
vantages for seeing and comparing
the different makes in one great dis
play. Because of its size, there is :o
building Mailable on the Indiana: tJr
ground large enough' to house the
motor show, and the coming display
will be seen in an enormous tent.
Since no additional admission is
charged, practically all of the 200,000
visitors to the state fair will see the
auto show.
