LETTER FROM CAPTAIN HUME
Infirmary Soys Well Looated snd
Happy
The following is taken from an in
teresting letter received by Dr. A. M.
Home from his son. Captain Harold
A. Hume, commanding the Thirty
second Infantry infirmary, composed
of Owosso men, at El Paso, Texas:
El Paso, Texas, Saturday Evening.
My dear Dad, Mother, and Sister:
Your letter from Chicago was cer
tainly a dandy. Just like you. It
followed me into camp, almost upon
my heels in fact.
We are quite set now, and have
plenty to do; not too much, but enough
to keep our minds and bands busy.
This is a fine thing, because I've
settled down as you said in your letter.
I'll see the thing through and see it
through In the best way. There Is one
position I've taken. This whole affair
wonld be and will be a total loss of
time to me unless I do one thing, i e.
enter into the businest with my whole
heart, my eyes and ears open, grasping
every bit of information I possibly can.
That is my plan and I'm going to do it,
aud by so doing, save myself many
hours of lonesoineness.. I feel that I've
learned a lot already, and when niv
! little outfit comes home, If they haven't
learned and prohted It won't be my
fault. Some things they will learn:
lit, bow to care for themselves hy
gienically speaking; 2nd, the value of
money; 3rd, the value of discipline.
4th, the absolute necessity of antici
pating things and looking ahead; 5th,
the results of system and organization;
6th, tho value of attention to detail.
Besides these of course, will be the
knowledge of Banitary troops' work.
We are in a big school and by realizing
it we will surely profit.
Last night Major Lee, Dr. Hoslie
and myself attended the raising of a
Master Mason by El Paso lodge. It
was army night and a grand time was
arranged. Luckily I had my lode
receipts and managed to get in. After
lodge a banquet was served and a Dr.
J Miller of El Paso, brought us back to
camp In his car.
We are camped right in the city of
El Paso lower and it's only a short
walk to the heart of the city. They
have a beautiful Masonic home with
reading rooms, club rooms, etc., and
we already feel more than at home.
It sure seems good to have a place like
that to -go. Of course, I had to tell Dr.
Miller you were Past Grand Master.
He's a 33rd. Reflected glory you see.
But they sure were fine and we have a
home. You surely1 would have enjoyed
such a meeting. The work is much
different than Michigan, but Masonry
just the same.
All the boys are fine. We certainly
appreciate what the people did for us
and when we get a little more settled,
I'm going to write esch one separately.
Love to all. I hope you won't have to
grub stake me, dad. Have you anyone
to help you? (Of course this is to
mother and the girl, too). Love to you
all and don't worry because we are
exceedingly well located.
Lovingly, HAROLD.

Washington Letter.
Washington, Aug. 2. (Special cor
respondence) Democrats eudeavor to
convince farmers that they get no
advantage from a protective tariff, but
the facts are otherwise.
The Canadian government publishes
report written by its New Brunswick
representative in Cuba, relative to the.
Cuban market for bay, from which the
following Is quoted:
"Cuba is increasing its hay imports.
the total augmenting from 15,870 tons
In 1912 to 23 331 tons in 1915. Nearly
all of this comes from the United
States and Canada, and while in 1913
Canada supplied about the same share
as the United States, in 1915 the latter
country furnished 21,448 tons as against
only 1,717 tons from Canada. The
Canadian decrease is said to be due to
the war."
This Is just another windfall from
the European war which has been
picked up by tne farmers of the United
States, and which the Democrats will
credit to their administration.
The Democratic tariff law cut the
duty on hay 50 per cent, or from 4 to
$2 per ton, which pleased Canada im
mensely she being our chief competitor
In hay. Comparing the ten months
ended July 31, 1914. the first ten months
operation of the Democratic tariff law
before the outbreak of the European
war, with the ten months ended July
31, 1913, with the Republican tariff
law in operation, and the official
figures show that our imports of hay
fnyn Canada increased 50 per cent
under the Democratic law; while dur
ing the ten months ended July, 1915,
our Imports of hay from. Canada were
almost negligible because Canada was"
sending all she could spare to Europe,
Recently Imports of hay from Canada
have been picking up again, nearly
eight times as much coming in during
the ten months of the fiscal year 1916,
ended April, as during the ten months
ended July 31, 1915. The close of the
present calendar year will again fled
Canada engrossing a generous share of
our market for hay.
In a letter to an active Progressive
in Michigan, Col. Roosevelt says that
sevdn-eighths of the party in New York
had deserted before heaver considered
throwing in his lot once more with the
Republicans. The estimate is none too
high. For many states it is entirely
too low. The fact is that fully ninety
per cent of the Progressives of 1912
were Republicans prior to that time
and that they are Republicans again
now. None of the few "converts"
whom Democratic headquarters is
bragging about has yet been discovered
to haye had a Republican record. They
are all ex-Democrats.
U. S. Senator Reed Smoot. of Utah
" Exportation from the United States
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1916,
were the greatest in the history of the
country. They were over $4,000,000,000.
More than half of these exportationa
were munitions of war and to meet de
mands by the war. As soon as the war
closes, that market will cIbo. The
actual truth Is that there have been
less exportationa of products ots the
country that are generally sent to
foreign countries in the past year than
there had been for years and years
before. Just as soon as the war ceases
all the trade of all the Industries manu
facturing that $2,000,000,000 worth and
more will have to find a market else
where or the employees will be turned
out of employment.

us all rejoice in Democratic properity,
