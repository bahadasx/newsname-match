KITCHENER
DEAD, SAYS
VIEfIEGK!
XKW YORK, Aug. 4. —What
the Germans think al the rumor
of Karl Kitchener's death as a
hoax to fool Germany was toll to
day by George Sylvester Vicra_lt,
editor of "Fatherland," the Ger
man-American publication.
"Startling as the Idea •mist le
to many, 1 am not surprised to
learn from the uneensored story
brought to Xew York that .bore
are serious doubts in Kngl md as
to whether Lord Kitchener really
is dead.
"That the question wh?n rais
ed in the house of commons
should have been side-stepped '
must certainly mystify many peo- j
pie, but many things the English i
parliament does are inexplicable
to t|r Outside world.
A Legendary Hero.
"However, at the bottom of my
heart, I am convinced Kitchener'
Is dead, the victim of a German
mine or submarine.
"That Britain harbors the be
lief that lie Is living and that 'Us
death was agigantic hoax I i fool
Uermnny is due to the same kind
of phonomenon of war psychology
that gave birth to 'the angels of
Minis myth; il Is a child of bruins
temporarily unbalanced by the
horrors of war.
"Kitchener has become a le
gendary hero; from now till the
end of time his name will he as
sociated with a fascinating myth
ology. Kitchener died when his
work was done, his armies raised,
the munitions supply of the allies
reformed and enlarged.
"To England, Kitchener, discip
linarian of nations, was swallow
ed by the sea like a mythical
demigod when his task was done.
That lie lives is but a wish, father
to tlie thought!
llody Never Found.
"The whole story makes a grsat
appeal to my Immagination. That
Kitchener lives —that It Is his I
brain that Is now dlrettlng the
great simultaneous offensive of
the allies —Is not impossible, but
It is very improbable.
"Kitchener's body was certninly
never found; the circumstances
eurrounding his death are still
shrouded in mystery.
"That typewritten death no
tices were sent out within o few
hours of the sinking of the Hamp
shire and arrangements made for
King George to attend the great
memorial service in St. Paul's
cathedral are all facts upon which
weird rumors ran flourish, but
Kitchener IS dead!"

IHI 4, I iml.iinl entered the (treat
world-war.
You »ill read this article on Auk. 4,
11)10, exactly two years later.
Two years of the wildest war dunce
ever known, and now men can see
slow I) emerKliiK the uriin shape of the
. fiddler that will deiiiuiid the pay for all
this red sport.
Before long he will be stretching out
his hand for his coin, and when that
time comes there will likely be strange
doings on this queer old earth, believe
me.
What rips things up more than war?
Why, what comes after war, and that la
what we arc scheduled to find out.
Look at this for a starter.
Here is a worklngman, average of
his kind. You have heard nothing
about him since the dance began. Your
news has been all about rulers, poten
tates, chancellors, prime ministers, gen
erals and that sort; armies advancing
and retreating, digging in and digging
out; every day about a barrel of It.
But not a word about him, the huge,
overshadowing figure obscured in tlie
backgrond.
HOW IS THAT?
Yet he bears the whole thing on his
big, broad back. He digs up the hun
dred million dollars a day of war ex
penses that the dancers are slinging
around them.
He will pay every cent of the incon
ceivable debt that is being piled up, IF
IT IS EVER PAID AT ALL.
He does mos: of the fighting. His
muscles and his will and the way the
thing seems to him will settle the re
sult.
He could make peace now If he
wished to.
And with one sweep of his big, hard
fist he could push all the rest into the
sea—gold lace, many medaled and hot
stuff (ommanders, prime ministers and
all.
EVERYTHING in the end hangs
on him, for he is 73 per cent of the
game, and in some days !»... Yet no
body interviews him. talks about
him, or reports how he feels.

Covers
Session
As a result of Thursday's hear
ing at the Nlsqually power plant,
when M. .1. McMlllln, a discharged
city employe, was reinstated by
the civil service advisory board,
decisive steps will be taken to oust
A. J. Holmes from the position of
superintendent of the Immense
plant.
City Attorney 11. E. Harmon at
tended the hearing and took
copious notes of the testimony.
These notes will be prepared in
typewritten form and will be pre
sented to Commissioner Drake by
the city council with a demand
that Holmes be replaced by some
other man.
In din ( ImnKc.
Members of the council freely
predicted Friday that Holmes
would not remain much longer
in charge of the plant.
Several previous attempts have
been made by the council to re
move Holmes.
But the superintendent, who
was connected with Commission
er Drake several years ago when
Drake was local manager of the
Snoqualmle Power Co., has al
ways been upheld \tt the com
missioner.
Charges that he had Insulted
women at La Grande, followed by
a letter from the women residents
of the power plan town demand
ing his removal, caused a mild
sensation in the council a year

No Whitewash Now.
Several discharged employes
have told stories at the city hall
of utter demoralization of dis
cipline at the power plant, but
every attempt at investigation has
been whitewsshed.
"There will be no whitewash
this time," said one of the city
commissioners today.
"Supt. Holmes must go, and the
council is ready to see that he
goes. Our plant is too valuable
to take any chances with."
No Personal Feeling in
Matter, Declares Drake
Commissioner Drake Issued the y
following statement Friday:
"1 never had and do not now

In the matter of the discharge of
Mr. McMlllln. The superintend
ent of tlie plant reported that Mr.
McMlllln had failed to obey or
ders and had disregarded the
rules and left his post of duty
without permission, and for these
reason he was dismissed.
"I was not present at the hear
ing and have only received a par
tial report as to what the testi
mony developed. I have not been
officially advised of the ruling of
the advisory board, but if it ill
rects the reinstatement of Mr
