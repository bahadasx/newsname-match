Norfolk, Va., Aug. 4. The allied
(misers pntrnling the entrance to
Hamilton Koads to prevent the de
parture of the German submarine
merchantman Deutschland still were
in position within sitiht of shore dur
ing yesterday and there was nothing
to indicate they were aware of the
passage of the Deuschland out
through the Capes Wednesday night
Marine men here believed the sub

across the Atlantic on her return voy
age to Germany.
t'apt. 1 1 i ii st-h of the war-bound Ger
man liner Neckur. who, on board the
tug Thomas I . Timmins. directed the
departure of the Deutschland, said
yesterday that the underwater freight
er passed unobserved within inn yards
of a I'nited States destroyer on neu
trality duty about a mile off the
Capes. He also disclosed that the
submarine submerged twice on her
way down the bay to test her engines.
Capt. Ulnach said It would he un
wise for him to disclose whether the
vessel went up or down the coast be
fore striking out to sea, or whether
she steered an easterly course
straight out.
in response to questions regarding
the prospect of the Hremen, sister
ship to the Deutschland, arriving in
American waters. Capt. Hiusch said:
"You can depend upon it thai If the
Bremen was coming in the near fu
ture, 1 would not he returning to
Baltimore and neither would the Tim-
iniiis. lie declined to say when the
remen was expected.
"When we came to a stop in the bay
which I shall not disclose because W6
all probably have to use the place
lgain." ('apt. Hindi continued, accord
ing to a dispatch from Norfolk, "the
pilot aboard the submarine' was taken
off to the Timmins, 't was then
about 6 O'clock in the morning. The
submarine was submerged, -so that her
machinery and pumps could be tested
uxl the Cargo trimmed, should that
necessary. She went down in a
deep hole in the hay to a depth of 1:15
feet remaining there for some time.
'When she came to the surface
gutn ( apt. Koenig came up through
the conning tower and said that
3 nr thing was working perfectly. We
started orr down the bay and when
no trallie was in sight the Deutsch
land took another dive while running.
She Went down until only four inches
of her periscope was showing above
the water. Then I dropped behind to
see at what distance the wake of the
Deutschland or the foam crest of the
periscope could he seen. At 400 yards
with glasses I could not see a thing.
'In the afternoon we started for
the ( apes and you know how the bet
ter part of the trip was made. The
destroyer was pas.-.ed in the dark. As
soon as the men on the bridge sighted
the lights ol the Timmins the)
watched us closely and looked ml
around for tlx- submarine which

"Later, when I reported to the
destroyer that the Deiifsc bland had
cleared the Capes and was on her way
to sea the officers aboard seemed most
surprised. They had not observed her
at all. So you se that the British

ROME ANO ROMANS
uuiiiun
Amateur Actors Score Big Success;
in Julius Caesar
FIRST PROOUCIION LAST NIGHT
Histronic Ability of Participants and
Beauty of Outdoor Theatre Add
to Enjoyment of Audience.
The initial performance of the PUT,
"Julius Caesar," was given last niht
in Clark's Woods.
Despite the early threat of unfriend
ly weather a large and appreciative
audience gathered in Bennington's
natur! theatre and in the twilight
awaited the opening scene. The band
began the overture, the march from
Aula, its majestic strains a fitting
prelude to the lofty scenes of the
ancient World. The lights flashed
on and a laughing, turbulent mob
the Roman king burst upon the view
of the audience. Home was making
holiday. The pampered populace that
had greeted Pcinpey as a god, that had
dallied with a thousand conquerors,
was rejoicing in the triumphs of yet
another hero Caesar!
The Illusion was complete: "the
grandeur that was Rome" was again
a reality. The laughing crowd, single
minded, hent on pleasure, follows the
lithe, swaying lorm of a dancer,
played by Miss Jam: Burgess. The
wrestlers come forth and the excited
people gathered around them as they
writhe in eadi other's grasp, Louis
Levin and James Moore played
the wrestlers with professional skill
and with all the spectacular tricks of
the sport. As one falls, the applause
breaks forth, to be stilled in a moment
by the appearance ol two senators,
Casca and Trehonlus, played by Dr.
L. II. Ross and Nelson Payne.
The scene transforms. Rome In Its
complexity dawns upon us; it is no
longer a happy throng but a sullen,
bitter people who growl and taunt and
ridicule these aristocrats. The first
citizen, a cobbler played by William
Cushman and tho second citizen, a
carpenter, played by John ll.iyts.
standing stalwart above the crowd
hear the bulk of Casca's rebuke at
their holiday-making, and meet him in
turn with the rude wit of the people.
In the first words of the first scene
the eternal genius of Shakespeare
makes Itself tell, for in less than a
moment lie paints Route with its fac
tious and fickleness, its classes ami its
masses.
The most prominent characteristic
of the production is its grandeur. The
play has noon stage I with a ready eye
to all Its color and pageantry. During
every moment of the play, the scene is
striking; colors are massed, men and
women are grouped with the sole aim
of making a balanced picture. There
is never an awkward pause; in natural
easy manner, the enett upon the eye
of the spectator is always the thing
sought,
Among the most vivid of the great
scenes of the play is tho entrunce of
Caesar. At last evening's perform
ance, the actors were again and again
interrupted by applause during this
scene, for the audience itseit seemed
to Jiave a touch ol the Roman In it.
When Caesar With his soldiers and
train composed of senators, soldiers
and stately, graceful women passed
from view, followed by the mob. tho
audieiici could not be restrained and
its applause delayed the continuing of
the scene. Another of tho great
moments ol the play when the stage
picture was most striking was during;
Mare Antony's speech over the dead
Caesar. This was a scene of move
ment and force and the artistic group
ing led many to reel that the mob was
the hero of the play.
It was Will Irwin who Invented tho
term "highbrow-." for which may he
bo eternally cursed - lor people! un
thinkingly have applied It to Will
Shakespenre the botcher's hoy. Mo
might easily stand acquitted on the
evidence of Julius Caesar this mag
nificlent melodrama of war unci poli
tics, of superstition, envy, revenge,
courage ami campaigns has perhaps
the widest appeal of any of the
master';; plays.
And -while "the play's the thing"--Shakespeare
found a east last evening
nearly vvoilhy of him. Dr. Ross was
a perfect Casca shrewd, cunning,
with a show of blindness that permit
ted him m speak his mind. Ills
p laying drew muc h applause. NeNon
Payne proved n perfect foil as Tre-
bonlui Judge Edward h Holden
had all the majesty nf the great Jul
ius, the World's conqueror. J. Law
rence QrtSWOld was a suave nnd lint
taring IVdus. The thing that usually
makes Shnkespeaie difficult Is the
dramatic ability demanded in many
small parts. Gordon Burke as Pin
darns drew n round of SPPlaone;
Joseph ii mien as Mervius remiercti a
dramatic message with vividness and
tone; Dean Martin as the Soothsayer
made one nuirvol at Caesar skeptic

orator. It Is difficult to praise in
measured phrase so excellent an in
terpretation of so difficult a part; the
mob speech with its constant Inter
ruptions, its excitement and turbul
ence is a test for any professional
actor's knowledge of his lines. The
feat alone gains Mr. Jenney a name as
an amateur actor.
George S. Mills, as Casslus, was al
ways the envious, choleric politician;
Quick to anger, shrewd In his judg
ments, always striking fire. Yet It
was played with restraint and finished
art, always with the right pause, tone,
inspiration, always with the know
ledge of the value of a word. Casslus,
BS played by Mr. Mills, was a charac
ter the portrayal of which is rarely
Squalled upon the prolessional stage.
Arthur Kiliot, as Brutus, was of
Course, the artist above all else. If
Brutus has ever been played with
more consummate art since Booth
played the part. It has not been re
corded in theatrical annals. Ho
swayed Ids audience in every sceno
nnd was a reader of lines worthy of
the great mnstci.
The feminine half of the world was
very small in the Roman eye and as
th suffragists say "Where is them
Romans now?" If beauty and grace of
carriage were characteristics of the
Roman mntronSi Miss Jeanette Per
kins as Portia and Miss Susan Colgate
as Oalph Uinta were true ladles of the
great republic. Each has a beautiful
stage presence and one of the "six
gifts of a girl," a soft voice. Miss
Anustasia Pilsger.ild as Brutus page,
Lucius, played the part with charm
and in the tent scene proved a perfect
I i
foil lor Mr. Elliot as Brutus. The
Mines with LuslUI w-ore played with
a restraint and tenderness that makes
strong contrast with the vigor and
violence of the main a Hon.
