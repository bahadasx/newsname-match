COMMISSIONER IIILLEGAS VISITS
SUMMER SESSION.
t'ommissioner Milo B. Hillegns of the
State Department of Education was nn
interested visitor nt the Summer Ses
sion on Friday of last week. He gave the
entireday to the inspcction of classes,
conferenceswithinstructors und teach
ers, and discussion of plans with Dr.
Collms. Heexpressd his pleasure in vis-
lting Middlebury, and gave a veryinter
ing talk to the teachers and assembled
guests in the social hall at Pearsons at 8
o'clock in the evening. An informal
gathering of a hundred or more teachers
and friends and interested people from
the village greeted the Commissioner
and gave the closest attention to his
address. Dr. Hillegas explained the
plans of tho department by which
teachers will be certified under the new
arrangement which went into effect the
first of July. A large number of
teachers, probably more than half of
those in the State, will exchange their
old certificates for certificates issued
under the new regulations. Dr. Hillegas
referred to the antiquated methods of
instruction in the more common
branches which are still prevalent in
many sections, and stated that the
teacher of today must be one who can
lift herself out of such conditions. She
will do this only by more advanced
preparation for the special work which
she is to do. Above all. the nunils of
the schools must be shown that the
work of the school is of vital importance
nnd is closely connected with the work
of the work-a day world. The resnonse
which the teachers of Vermont hnvp
made to the call for better traininu has
placed more than a thousand of Ver
mont teachers in Summer Session,
within and without the Stale. Com
missioner Hillegas said this is some
thing which has never been witnessed
before, nnd it is a good portent of the
new order of things.

HONEY PRODUCED IN MIDDLE
7BURY. Some idea may be gained of the
honey producing possibilities of Ver
mont from the fact that the firm of J.
E. Crane & Son of Middleburv have for
some time boen bringing in from its
apiaries an average of a ton of honey a
day. Crane honey is known through
out New England and far beyond its
borders, and the containers used by this
firm carry the name of Vermont to far
distant points.
J. E. Crane, the seniormember of the
firm who is one of the State inspectors
of aparies, recently visited West Rut
land and burned up an entire yard of
bees, consistinc of some 20 hives. be-
longing to a resident of that town.

the bees.
iale Prices or War Prices?
Which Will You Pay?
This is probably your last chance to decide. All raw materials
trom wluch the Moosier Labinet is made have abvanced in
cost. This has compelled the maker to announce a comin?
advance iti the prices ofthese famous Kitchen cabinets, But
not iwtil the present stock is sold. We have a limited allot
ment of cabinets. So come before they are gone and the
prices are advanced.
