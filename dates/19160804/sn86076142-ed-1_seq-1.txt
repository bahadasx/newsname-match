GERMANS ARE AHEAD
AGAINATVERDUN
Recapture Heuryjaken By France
Last Month, at a Terrible
Toll of Human Life
I lly AanoelMleil Preaa.)
PARIS, August 4. Attacking simul
taneously from the northwest and
southeast, the French stormed Fleury,
ninth of Verdun, and captured sev
eral hundred Germans. Later the
Germans launched a furious counter
iltack, and, after several violent at
tempts, succeeded In Raining a foot
hold In the Bouth part of the village.
The French continue to hold the
northern section, where heavy fight
ing progresses.
Verdun thus again Is the center of
the war stage. The capture of Kleury,
which the Germans held over a
month, caused great elation In France.
The Germans appear less capable of
operating on the old overwhelming
scale and Initiative, and military men
believe they are about to pass from
France permanently.
While the German artillery con
tinues powerful, apparently the com
manders are unable to gather masse
of troops necessary to reap the bene
lit of artillery preparation. It Is
twenty days since the Germans made
the last big attack on the right bank
of the nieuse, whereby they obtained
small restilta at heavy cost. On the
left bank nothing beyond local at
tacks have been attempted for a
week past. The whole section from
Vacherauvllle to the approaches of
Souvllle gradually fell Into the hands
of French bombers when the higher
command Judged the time ripe for an
attack on all sides simultaneously.
The Germans offered desperate re
sistance, but the French bayonets
finally prevailed.

ONE STEP FURTHER
TOWARD LI
In a subway nearly a third of a
mile beneath the streets of Tonopah,
a mine superintendent is holding his
acetylene torch against the side of
the bore. "This," he explains, "is the
hanging wall of the Murray vein. It
is ore the entire distance to the
foot." ...,...., t .... ,- 1,.,. V.".;
That instant, from beyond a curve
in the crosscut, a motorman gave his
warning signal and a train of ore
cars came rumbling and roaring into
sight, the gentle up grade being
easily accomplished at big! speed by
the trolley locomotive.
The writer gave a hall- with up
lifted hand, as anyone would at a
crowded street corner, and the train
came to a stop. "Are you going to
the face?" queried the man at the
controller lever as the power was
reapplied. "No, the footwall will be
far enough." The train slackened
and stopped. "Footwall," called out
the motorman, and the Journey was
over.
The distance traversed was entirely
within a cross section of a vein of
silver and gold. Above from the
1540 level to the 900, beneath to un
explored depths, to the east for
known hundreds of feet and to the
west for a distance that has not yet
been measured or explored, extends
this giant of alluf Tonopah's great

today is at the 1540 station in the

Dr. John EX Worden, Elko county's

paralysis epidemic which originated
as usual in New York, is of vital
importance to everybody In this state,
because, in his opinion, after careful
investigation, he is convinced that
the dread disease is being scattered
throughout the country through the
medium of sweat shop goods sold
through the big mall order houses of
New York, Chicago, and other eastern
cities, which have branches at Seattle
and San Francisco.
"The father or mother," said Dr,
Worden, "who purchases by mail a
'bargain' garment from one of these
houses, may be bringing Into the
home one of the deadliest of dangers
known to science. I would no more
think of allowing a mall order pur
