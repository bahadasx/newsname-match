FAMILY ARRIVES
ON LONG AUTO TRIP
Martin llentlr, wife and duughter
of llrownsville, Tex., arrived In St.
Helen Krlduy Inst and after spend
ing several days with a relative, Mrs.
J. C. Wreford of St. Helens, left on
their return trip to Texas. Mr. lies-
tiro and family, after fixing up a
Kurd cur like a little home, left
llrownsville eurly In lust" May nnd
have heen motoring In a leisurely
way jiliico then. They ciiiiie via Kl
I'uso, Tex., mid through New Mexico
and Colorudu hefore striking the Cali
fornia line. From tho (iolden statu
they cume to Oregon. Since leaving
Texan In May they huvo driven their
cur 6,000 miles. Mr. Ilestlro gives
some very Interesting facts concern
ing the Mexican situation as H was
when he left Texas, and from his
Intlmute knowledge of Mexicans and
what Is going on In Mexico, ho Ih of'
the opinion Unit sooner or later the
I'nlted States will have to tuke a
hund In that benighted country's af-
fairs. Mr. Ilestiro, who is taking tlm
trip on account of his wlfe'a lieulth,
stutes he Is In no hurry lo get hack
and will go wherever ho takes a no
tion to go, hut expects to he huck
In Texas In September or October.
As stuted, ho has his machine so
equipped that ho cun enmp nt most
any old place, and bus many of the
enliven lances of the modern home.
II. K. Corntbwulte of this city Is nn
old ncciuHlntanco of Mr. HeHtlro, and
those old pals spent many liourB In
going over tho old times they had
down In the Lone Star State.
Tho Cerniun suhiiiarlno merchant
man Dcutsehland slipped quietly out
of tlm Virginia capes ut 8:30 o'clock
WediicHiluy night, and is now hcuded
for her homo port in Germany. The
open seu was reached uftor dusk, and
the submarine submerged within the
three mile limit. Only one warship
wuii seen off the Virginia const dur
ing the day mid It Is more ihan pos
sible tliut the submarine has eluded
this vessel. This wonderful . vessel
left lliiltlniore Tuesday afternoon and
proceeded down Chcsupike hay, und
when darknens begun to fall made
a dash for tho open sea. A private
telegram to tho Mist received at 4
o'clock Thursday afternoon, states
that nothing further hud been heard
of tho DeutHchlund, and it is the pre
sumption that sho is now well under
way to tho fatherland, carrying tho
vnluuble cargo uud nlcklo which she
loaded ut Baltimore. A sister ship
of tint Deiitschlund, the llremcn. Is
daily expected In soino I'nlted Stutes

THE DEAD

Joseph Keelan, 19.
George Hammar, 32.
Herman Voss, 20.
C. E. Winchell, 35.
Tho most horrible accident record
ed in tho annuls of Columbia county
occurred Monday forenoon at about
11:30 at the county quarry on the
Fred Adams place, on Tide creek,
eight miles noth of this place on
the Columbia Highway, when six
men lost their lives In a flush.
The scene of the accident Is horri
fying beyond description, as portions
of human bodies were scattered over
an area of nearly two acres. Pieces
of human flesh were hanging on
trees and parts of bodies were blown
nearly a quarter of a mile distant.
Out of the mass of human wreckage
only two bodies could be recognized,
that of Leroy Lewis and Joseph Kee
lan. The road workers had finished
drilling a "coyote hole," a "T"
shaped tunnel into tho solid rock,
und were storing and tamping black
powder and dynamite when the death
dealing blast occurred.
"Coyoting" a hillside is done to
save time and lubor and has been
followed In tho road work. Instead
of blurting away the obstruction bit
by bit, a tunnel is driven into the
hillside and a huge quantity of ex
plosives" rammed into place. The re
sult usually clears away the hillside.
Such force accompanied the fatal
explosion that the countryside was
shaken. Persons living and work
ing nearby came rushing to the smok
ing tunnel and in the flush of ex
citement were unable to take co
herent action. Mr. Akin was the
one to notify the coroner, who gath
ered the severed atoms of flesh and
hone to return them to this city.
J. W. Akin, superintendent of the
quarry, nnd the only survivor, was
at the mouth of the tunnel in which
seven cans of black powder had been
loaded. A few minutes before the
accident, F. H. Lewis, who was in
the tunnel with the other men, asked
him if he would take the cover off
a can of powaer. just as ne Dent
over the can to do so, the explosion
took place. An avalanche of rock
possed over him, thumping him on
tho head with small fragments of
rock, but aside from being badly
shaken he escaped with slight in
juries.
He sr.w the great volumo of dirt
and rock pouring out of the tunnel
When the dust cleared a little, he
went to the tunnel. Lewis had been
near the edge of the opening and
Keelan was directly at the mouth
when he saw them before the explo
sion, but they were nowhere to be
seen except bits of flesh and scraps
of clothing. Mr. Akln's coat wns
only a short distance from him and
it was torn into shreds.
Tho real cause of the accident will
remain a mystery. Mr. Akin is of
the opinion that it was caused by a
flashlight coming in contact with the
explosives, thus making a connec
tion. He Is quite sure that none of
the men were smoking, as smoking
was strictly forbidden by Mr. Lewis
Mr. Lewis was a powder, man of
many ' years experience and took
every precaution to" guard against
accident.
-Just before the explosion occurred
young Lewis came out for the ex
plosives, while the crew remained in
the hole helping to set the charges
This accounts for the fact that his
body was not mangled, as he was
nearest the opening. His body was
blown a distance of perhaps a qunr
ter of a mile and his head In the
opposite direction, landing at the
edge of tho creek. Keelan's body
was torn In two and found almost
a quarter of a mile from the mouth
of tho tunnel. The other bodies
(Continued on page 5)
A ballot taken among the 400,000
employes of 225 different railroad
Bystems of the United States in their
operating departments indicates a
general strike. The railroads have
urged congress to take swift action
towards averting the threatened
strike. President Wilson has been
appealed to and is watching the situ
ation closely. A strike just at this
time would seriously affect the whole
country. Running out of Portland
on the Astoria division of the S. P.
& S. Railroad are some 100 men in
tho train and engine service, and If
strike occurs the service will be
demoralized, which will affect St.
Helens and surrounding country. At
the time of going to press, the Mist
has received no definite word of what
the final decision is, but it is hoped
the federal authorities will intervene
and save the public the great incon
venience which is now threatened.
BACK FROM
BRITISH COLUMBIA
Glen R. Metsker and family re
turned Sunday from a ten days visit
to Washington and British Columbia.
Mr. Metsker, after driving his auto
mobile to Tacoma, left his wife and
daughter in the City of Destiny and
motored to Wenatchee to drop in his
ticket which entitled him (if he was
lucky) to a choice portion of the Col-
vllle reservation. Mr. Metsker did
not wait to see just what section he
would get, but drove back to Taco
ma, got his family, and for the past
week has been motoring through
British Columbia. Ho states the
roads are in fairly good condition
except the portion of It which crosses
the Cascade mountain range. During
the entire trip of more than 1,200
miles, he had no auto trouble except
one puncture just as he was about
to enter Oregon territory.
