point where the French have
scored advances. In an' attack on
a three mile front from east of the
river Meuse they pushed .north
along the river toward Vaucherau
ville wood, and further east at
tacked and gained possession of
the Thiaumont redoubt. They
found the Thiaumont position un
tenable, however, because of the
German bombardment and were
compelled to withdraw from it.
Meanwhile fi£htirfg on 'the
Somme front has dwindled to
minor, operations. London reports
the gain of some ground In oper
ations to the west of Pozleres.
After having been temporarily
held up In the Stokhod region by
the persistent Teutonic resistance,
the Russians succeeded in ef

cording to general belief here.

Preparing to Import Strikebreakers.
New York, Aug. 4.—Comferences of
the leaders of the four great brother
hoods of railroad employes, represent
ing 400,000 men, the majority of whom
are believed to have voted to strike on
225 railroad systems, were held here
today. These meetings were to en
able the leaders to decide on their
course of action if the representa
tives of the railroads again refuse
their demand for an eight hour day
and other changes. The railroad
leaders declined to discuss the ap
peal to President Wilson to prevent
the threatened national railroad strike.
It lies in their power by virtue of
the vote now being counted to call a
strike if the railroads do not accedc
to their demands. It is expected the
conference committee of the railroad
management will again refuse the
men's demands at the meeting next
Tuesday and that the managers will
advocate arbitration: or that the
strike be settled under the Newlands
act of 1914. by a commission of six
men, two to be appointed on either
side and two to be neutral. It is not
regarded as likely that the railroad
leaders will consent to this.
In case of a deadlock the railroad
managers look -,to President Wilson
to take a hand in the controversy in
calling representatives of both sides
to Washington and notifying them
they must compose their differences
in some manner in the public inter-
Chairmen of the trainmen's unions in
the west and southwest continued to
arrive in tlie city today bringing bal
lots marked by men on their respective
lines. Thus far more than 75 per cent
of the 400,000 votes has been counted.
Nearly all favor a ^trl^e.
AWAITING DEVELOPMENTS.

Until Vote is Counted.
Washington, Aug. 4.—Judge W. L.
Chambers, commissioner of the United
States board of mediation and concil
iation, conferred with President Wil
son today over the threatened strike
of 400.000 railroad employes. They
discussed every phase of the situa
tion, but Judjje Chambers told the
president he believed there was noth
ing formal that the federal govern
ment could do until the railroad man
agers and representatives of the
employes meet again next week, after
counting the strike voto has been
completed.
Judge Chambers thinks the situa
tion is not hopeless and there Is still
a chance for the employers and em
ployes to reach an agreement. The
board of mediation and conciliation
expects to be called in the case if a
break appears inevitable.

AUTO OWN.ER8 STUNG.
Maila Closed to League In- Buffalo
Which Promiaed Cheap ftuppHss,
Washington, Augi4.-rQrtes: ter- ven
geance from many automobile owners
in the United States-who admit they
were badly stuok brought results
today when tho postoffice depart
ment denied the use of the malls to
the International Automobile League,
Inc., and the International A/utomiblle
League Tire company of Buffalo, N.
Y., and A. C. Bldwell, president of
both concerns.
The action announced by Solictor
General Lamar Is tho resultrof com
plaints mnde last March by the Amer
ican Automobile association and the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the
World seeking to abolish fraudulent
advertising.
Bidwell was charged with amass
ing a fortune by employing agents who
solicited members for the league by
representing that membership en
abled the motor drivers to obtain
tires and accessories at manufactur
ers' prices.
Owners of advertised brands denied
the existence of contracts which
would make this possihle, although
it appears $200,000 in stock was sold.
Bidwell is under federal Indictment
for misuse of the malls.
It Is charged by the department
that nllexed "manufacturers' prices"
on standard automobile tires and
supplies were advertised merely as
ba.lt to secure a $10 annual fee from
members to whom the league might
sell inferior tires and supplies at a
stiff profit.
League members testified that when
they endeavored to realise the big
savings promised by the prices llated
on standard articles, they were In
formed that the league was "just out"
but that an excellent article manu
factured especially for the league
could be supplied In place of the one
ordered.
WTien members complained they were
referred to a clause In the member
ship contract which specified that
goods listed would be furnished when
obtainable.
"Crystad oil" was a lubricant lilted
In the league's catalogue as being of
"exceptional quality." Government
investigation indicates this oil came
out the same barrel from which orders
were filled for a cheaper grade.
Members testified that five or six
years after they had paid their initial
$10 annual fee to the leagua. an at
tempt was made to collect $10 for
each of these years on the strength of
a clause In the application making
membership perpetuating unless res
ignation was filed by registered mall
sixty days before the expiration of
the membership year.
