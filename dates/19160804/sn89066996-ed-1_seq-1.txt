GREAT GATHERING
AT FRENCH VILLAGE
That Splendid Old Settlement Again
Acquits Itself Most Creditably in
Its Hospitable Holiday Spirit
THE STATE PRIMARY
F. D. Gardner, Democrat, far in Lead for
Governor, Atkinson Second Lamm
Leads Among Republicans
Returns from Tuesday's primary
over the State arc incomplete, but suf
ficient to indicate with considerable
certainty who are the nominees for
the principal State offices.
Gardner, Democratic candidate,
leads his nearest opponent, Atkinson,
by about 30,000 votes, yesterday's re
turns giving Gardner 67,720 and At
kinson 31,678. There will be some
changes, as the returns from outlying
districts are received, but it is not be
lieved that Atkinson can by any
means catch up with Gardner.
Lamm, the Republican candidate for
Governor, leads his nearest oppo
nent, Swanger, by 34,000 votes,
Lamm being credited with 67,137 and
Swanger with 4,228. The latter will
have to make large gains in the re
turns yet to come in to get any way
near Lamm.

C. K Pratt, president and general
manager of the Lead Belt and Farm-1
ingtonj Telephone Company, called j
Monday to tell us that The Times did
the management an injustice in its
article ol last week under the caption
of "Unpardonable Negligence", in
which his company was held responsi
ble for the loose wire that was thrown
acioss the electric railroad trolley
wire aud attached to the wire fence
of thtf'Clardy lot, resulting in a dead-j
ly charge of the fence. Mr. Pratt tells
us that the wire in question was one
of a telephone line to DeLassus be
longing to the electric railroad, with
which the telephone company had
nothing to do. The wire was broken
when the Farmington municipal au
thorities were having the trees trim
med that interfered with the muni
cipal lighting wires. The end was
thrown over into the lot and eventu
ally sagged down until it came in con
tact with the trolley wire. The line
man of the telephone company ob
sc'' red it and gave notice of the situ
ation to some one who had to do with
the dangerous wire. We are glad to
make this amende, as The Times al
ways is when its information is er
roneous. In the course of conversation Mr.
Pratt referred to a former criticism
of the telephone service in Farming
ton which appeared in The Times.
He said that it had long been the pur
pose of his company to give Farm
ington an improved telephone service)
and that the contract for a modern
switchboard and telephone receivers
had been made some months since.
These were to have been delivered a
couple of months ago by the con
tracting company, but for some reason
it had defaulted in furnishing the
switchboard and receivers at the date
agreed upon, thus delaying the tel
ephone company in installing the new
equipment. Mr. Pratt expects soon
to be able to meet all the requirements
and give our town a much improved
telephone service, which he recognizes
is not all that it should be. All of
which is good news, for our people
will certainly appreciate any change
for the better and hope that it may
soon be made.
That hospitable old settlement of
French Village, nestling in the foot
hills of the Ozarks, in the extreme
northeastern corner of St. Francois
county, last Saturday again upheld
its well-earned reputation of giving
an annual picnic which, in point of
development ot the true holiday and
frolicsome spirit, is second to none, it
is claimed by those who have long
i attended these annual frolics, in Mis-
souri or any other State.
To reach this somewhat secluded
spot from Farmington means a ride
of about twenty-five miles, but the
roads generally are fair for an auto
and the trip can be made with assured
safety, in little more than an hous.
There is no other way to reach that!
uniting neighborhood than by wagon
or auto road, as it is located about 15
miles from a railroad.
The drive there is most enjoyable,
as it takes one through some of the
finest farming lands in this county.
The kaleidoscopic view the writer had
of that country last Saturday iin-
I pressed us with the fact that abundant
j harvests are In prospect generally
throughout that section of country,
! with the addition of one or two time
ly rains. While along the entire route
moisture was beginning to be needed,
little or no damage was apparent from
want of rain.
Final! v the" nicnlc irrounus we,e
leached, where were assembled in aj
shady grove 1500 or 2000 people, withj
ail tne amusement and refreshment
stands that usualy go with picnics, and
everyone appeared to be having a real
good time. It was more like a home
coming event, where all were ac
quainted with everybody, many of
whom had perhaps not met during the
past year, thus adding greater pleas
ure through months of separation. It
is such meetings, among staid, sub
stantial citizerrry, that has, in such
great measure, added to the fame of
the French Village picnics.
But there is at least one other dis
tinguishing feature to these annual
gatherings, that always keeps them
Iresh in the minds of thoso who an-
nually attend them. That is the
knowledge that here can always be
secured one of the best dinners it isi
possible to secure, and the long jour-
ney most of them have taken to get
there puts them in fine fettle to thor
oughly enjoy an appetizing feed. And
those French Villagers appear to live
to eat, and insist in all diners with
them having more, even after they are
"loaded to the guards."
These annual occasions have for
years been a part of the life of this
community, and with the passing
years has come a knowledge of how to
prepare for the crowd, no matter what
its size may be. So that after all
had eaten until they could eat no
more, there still seemed to be great
kettles, barrels and baskets of eat
ables that had never been touched.
In this way everyone on the grounds
contributed their mite to the Catho
lic church organization, under whose
nuspices these annual events are giv
en for French Village is a strong
Catholic community.
Another very pleasing diversion
was afforded when Francis A. Ben
ham of this city, in an eulogistic man
ner, introduced Hon. Walter L. Hens
ley as the speaker of the day. For
about forty minutes Mr. Hensley held
his hearers in rapt attention, dwell
ing on the devastated havoc now be
ing wrought by the v.rid war, in
which all countries involved are being
ravished, not only of their manhood
and wealth, but of ti:UL. eivUixation
and intelligence, tfs v.el. Yet, in spite
of such inexpressibly blighting havoc,
he said that, so far as this country is
concerned, the results of next No
vember's election meant more to the
citizens of the United States than
does the results of that war.
He said the Democrats had every
thing good on their side to fight for,
and that so long as President Wilson
remained in the Presidential chair
the people of this country would con
tinue to enjoy the greatest blessing
any nation can enjoy peace so long
as it can be secured through conserva
tive and wise statesmanship. He said
this was pre-eminently a Democratic
year, every sign pointing to an over
whelming endorsement of the Wilson
administration, both in the State mhu
Nation. It was easily discerned that
Mr. Hensley's speeech met with the
hearty approval of practically all
those who heurd him.
CHURCH CENTENNIAL
Sheriff Joe Williams returned home
Monday from Mineral Wells, Texas,
where he spent several weeks taking
baths in the medical springs there,
and his health seems to be considera
bly improved. He could not stay
away while the battle of ballots was
in progress, but will probably return
"vvn to complete his course of treatment
The centennial of the Caledonia
Presbyterian church was celebrated
this week, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday (today). Dr. E. C. McCor
mick and family with Rev. Warner H.
DuBosc as their guest, and W. E.
Matkin and family, accompanied by
Mrs. Ed Henderson, motored ever to
Caledonia Thursday morning to par
ticipate in the celebration. Among
the speakers for the occasion
are Rev. Warner H. DuBose of Farm
ington; Dr. J. F. Lawson of Cape
Girardeau; Rev. L. F. Ross of Jack
son; Rec. C. W. Anderson of Potosi;
Rev. Newton Smith" of New Madrid.
The organization of this church
was effected August 3, 1816, by a col
ony from North Carolina, and we be
lieve is the first Presbyterian congre
gation organized in what was then
the Louisiana Territory. Some of the
twenty names which appear among
the organizers are familiar, as many
of their descendants live in this sec
tion. Among them are the McCor
micks, Sloans, Robinsons, Boyds,
Alexanders and Stevensons.
Dr. D. H. Reed, formerly of Flat
River, now living in Des Moines, Iowa,
arrived in St. Francois county Tues
day and is visiting his old friend
Judge W. A. Mitchell, on his splendid
farm near Esther.
Close of Revival
The union revival meetings, which
were held in the tabernacle on the
Pirn lots in Farmington for six weeks,
came to a close Sunday night. During
these meetings a great religious
awakening had been aroused, which
is believed will continue to the infi
nite good of this town and county.
Several hundred souls were reclaim
ed, most of whom have already con
nected themselves with some religious
organization, and the spiritual uplift
of this community is most noticeable.
Among other good things that has
been accomplished through these
meetings has been the formation of
an exceptionally strong and vigorous
Gospel Team, which is composed of
about two hundred members all men
which will remain permanent. This
organization already has a course of
action and work mapped out, and their
awakening appears to be such as will
keep them constantly active in the
good work they have taken up. Burke
and Hobbs, who were in active charge
of the revival, left immediately for
Kennett, Mo., where they entered at
once, with their customary zeal, into
another revival meeting.
ENJOYABLE CONCERT
Through the public spirit of a num
ber of the music loving citizens of the
town, BarrolPs Orchestra was cm
ployed to give an open air concert on
the Band Stand last night, which was
enjoyed by a large crowd. This is a
highly pleasing feature for the sum
mer evenings, and we would be glad
fo see the concert repeated frequently.
Everybody enjoys it, and the orches
tra, as always, "delivers the goods."
Cemetery Work
Miss Azzie McMullin has handed us
the following list of additional donors
to the local chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution for the
improvement of the K. of P. Cemetery
and keeping it in order, a work which
the chapter has unselfishly undertak
en: George Mackley, 50c; John Mack
ley, 50c; A. P. Mackley, $2.00; Mrs.
W. R. Alexander, $1.00; Mrs. Wm.
Clay, Independence, Mo., $3.00; the
Haw family, $4.00; Mrs. Fred Gilles
pie, 50c; Mrs. Hortense Dalton Gra
ham, $2.00; Mrs. Frank Alexander,
25c.
The ladies of the chapter have al
ready done much work towards put
ting the cemetery in a presentable
shape, but there is still much more to
do, as they want to put in walks and
fix up the driveways, as well as see
that the graves and lots are kept in
good condition. It is a good work in
which they should be encouraged by
our people, and especially by those
who have loved ones and friends
buried there and all who own lots.
If you would help on the work don't
wait to be asked for donations, but
send any amount you feel like giving
to Miss Azzie McMullin through the
Farmington Post Office.
TESREAU KEATHLEY

New Subscribers
The following new names have been
added to The Times subscription list
