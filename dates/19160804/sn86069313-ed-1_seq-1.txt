Paris, Ky., Aug. 1. Paris has
gone "bathing crazy." The swim
mlng pool at tho local Y. M. O. A. is
being worked overtime; numorous
bathing parties go dally to Camp
Daniel Boone, and the banks of Ston
er creok are constantly lined with
throngs of society people ready to
take the plunge. .
Tho latest society fad Is automo-
Lllo bathing parties. A prominent
physician a fow dayB ago took n
party of young society belles In hU

hour's sport In the water thoy start
ed for town, hut became lost In the
woods and did not "get their bear

girls In two automobiles, clad only
In their bathing suits and pleasant
smiles, drove down Main street the
moro scdato mombcrB of the com

San Francisco, Aug. 1. Docu
mentary ovldcnco sulnclent to con
vict those In custody on a charge of
cuuBing the bomb explosion ten days
ago during the propircdness parade
wlu'ii nine persons wore killed and 40
injured, Is In tho hands of tho polloo
today, according to Dlrlrlct Attorney
C. M. Flckert.
A raid last night by tho pollco on
tho headquarters of the alleged lead
ers of tho plot resulted In the con
fiscation of tho prlvato lotter file and
other papers of Thomas Mooney, la
bor agitator suspected of being con
cerned In placing tho bomb.
According to Mr. Flckert, the let
ters contain Important evidence re
garding the explosion as well as In
formation boarlng on the wreckage
of the Los Angeles Times building
six years agp.
In one of vthe letters written by
Mooney Just prior to the prepared

Flckert: "It I can pull oft what I
am planning I will bo the biggest

HAY FEVER ATTACKS
"Thero are fow diseases wlilch
cause more discomfort and real suf
fering than that known as hay fe-i
ver. hay ostlAna or rose cold," says
Dr. M. B. Uavenel of the Department
of Provontlvo Medicine of tho Unl-
verslty of Missouri. Dr. Uavenel
says tho symptoms come on with
sneezing and watering of tho eyes,'
resembling In many ways tho symp
toms of an atuto cold, though It Is
much more prolonged and Is moro In- (
tenso. Often It is accompauled by,
asthma. I
It has been tho most difficult of
all diseases to prevent and cure,
and It Is only recently that tho cause
of it has been found. It has now '
been definitely proven that hay fe-(
ver Is duo to the pollens of various
plants. The most common of these
nro probably golden roiL, timothy
grass and rug wood. Tho albumin
ous portion of tho pollen produces'
tho disease. Somo people are sub-J
ceptible to various pollens, while
others are not us they have either
becomo Immunized or else they have
not the peculiar sensitiveness to the
albuminous constituents of tho pol-1
Ion. Tho dlseaso Is periodical, com
ing on each year, ulmost pn the samo
dny. J
Researches havo resulted In thO(
discovery of a vaccine for tho pre
vention of tho dlBeaso which Is qulto
successful. Much relief can bo glv-J
en by this treatment and In tho ma
jority of cases tho attack can bo ward
ed off. Vaccines nro now on tho
inarkot usually put up In little tubes
containing tho full dose with direc
tions for Injection under the skin.
It Is best to bgeln tho treatmont six or
eight weeks In advance of the tlmo
of tho expected attack. By the usoj
of tho vaccines, one is mado Immune
to tho pollens oi mo vuriuuo luuuio.
It Is llkowlso essential In tho pre
vention of hay fover, that all grass
and weeds be kept- down as much
as posslblo.

DUNDEE MAN PLUNGES
INTO WATERY GRAVE
TAKES TO UOUGH RIVF.lt WHILE
FLEEING FROM CONSTABLE
AND IS DROWNED.
While trying to escape from ar
rest at tho hands of Constable Char
lie Wedding last week Ferda Lee
-made his way through some bushe3
on the bank, plunged Into the waters
of Rough River and was drowned.
There wero no eye witnesses to the
drowning and most all who saw tho
flight of Leo believed that he had
made his escape, including Constable
Wedding. When ho did not show
up the next morning, however, a
search was begun. The river was
dragged but not until Saturday
morning was the body found. It I
nan uruifu up un uie uunuee mill
dam and was recovered by Tom
Smith, of Dundee.
A warrant had been sworn out
for Leo by Everett Maden, who claim
ed that he (Leo) had been discour
teous to his (Maden's) cousin, a
young girl some 15 or 16 years of
age. Constable Wedding approach
ed Leo Thursday afternoon near the
L. & N. depot. Ho was working
with the section crew, and bofore the
Constable could read tho warrant
he had started running in tho direc
tion of tho bridge. The officer gave
chase and claims ho fired three shots,
two Into tho ground and one about
six feet to tho right, In an effort to
stop him. Leo took retugo behind
some tics, then mado for some
bushes on the banks of Hough rlvor,
near what Is called the mill pond,
nnd disappeared. Ho was never seen
alive again. Wedding gavo up tho
chase at this stage and returned.
Tracks leading Into tho water flr3t
lead to suspicion, hut Leo was a
good swimmer nnd it was hard to
bollovo that ho could bo drowned at
that point. It is thought that ho
cramped.
A coroner's Inquest was held Sat
urday, tho body closoly examined and
Constable Wedding wns exonerated.
No bullet holes or marks wore found
on tho body nnd accidental drowning
wns given as tho cause ot death.
Young Leo wus tho son ot Mr. A. S.
Lee, ot Sunnydale.

States. Thesejatampa represent a
face valuo of 3221,875,000, and 1,

ed to print them. To make this pa
per 3,500 spruce trees, covering an

ONLY 1 PER CENT REPORT
Only One Man nt Rockport Ready to
Enter Shaft Nono at ' "v
Bevicr. '
(By Dan Walsh, Jr.)
Central City, Ky., Aug. 2. Thtf
first day of the attempt by the oper
ators In the coal field In and about.
Muhlenberg county to break the four
months' strike over wago and work
ing conditions had as little effect as
the order from the international or
ganization of tho union for the men
to return to their picks. In keoplng
with a promiso signified by the blow
ing of whistles of the mines belong
ing to members of the Western Ken
tucky Coal Operators' Association,
steam was up at all the mines this"
morning and tho shafts wero run
ning, but scarcely 1 per cent of the
strikers returned to work under the
condltlons proposed by the owners',""
approved by the Scale Committee
representing the union men, Indors
ed by the international organization,
but rejected by the district officers'
and their referendum vote.
Out of 400 men needed at Graham,
Ky., fourteen appeared this morning
with their cap lights and picks. At
Rockport one miner was ready to go
down In the shaft instead of the six;
the day before, this mine having ad
opte'd'tbo present plan of breaking
the strike?" At Bevler, where th
mines are owned by the Crescent Coal
Company, of which F. P. Wright,
header of the Western Kentucky Coal
Operators Association, is president,
i not a man offered to work. However,
the operators feel that, in view ot t hoover-Increasing
want among the 3,-
1 000 remaining miners who depend
for a livelihood for themselves and
their families upon the work in the
'mines, and the understanding that
the owners will not yield, the strik
ers gradually will yield:
Union Leaders Obstinate.
On the other hand, the union lead--
' ers are Just as confident that the''
miners will not surrender and that
the only way the strike can be
brought to a close Is for the opera
tors to sign a contract covering the
demands. H. H. Vincent, secretary
treasurer ot the district union, said
last night: "Wo have been busy all
day answering telephone calls from
miners who had been told by agents
of tho operators that despite our pro--testations
the district leaders would
not oppose the men going back to
work under tho conditions proposed
by tho owners. We have notified ev
ery miner In the district through the
officers of tho various locals that wa
have not relented one whit, that the
referendum has settled the matter,
and that the miners must not go back
to work until the operators sign a
contract for tho continuance of the
old scale In its entirety. Courier
