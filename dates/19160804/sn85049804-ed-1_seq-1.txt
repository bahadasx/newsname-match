EDITOR'S OBSERVATION.
Leaving Mt. Pleasant in the first
mud that he had experienced with our
car, we pulled into Burlington by
dark and found just about the same
people that we left here last year ex
cept at least the men were one year
older, also the ladies (but they won't
admit it). There is only one real
permanent church, the A. M. E.
church, pastored by Rev. B. F. Hub
bard, a young man of marked ability,
who is a hustler. He has charge of
the church at Fairfield. Mr. Peter
King, one of the oldest and best
known citizens here, is sick and he
has gone out to Colorado to spend
the summer. His wife and boys are
keeping house. They own a beautiful
modern home. The boys are very
musical and highly cultured.! Mr.
John L. Brooks has resigned as chef
at the Elks club and is back at his
old trade, that of paper hanging. He
owns a nice home out on Gertrude
street. Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Johnson
are still living at their beautiful
home
,W.

on Spruce'street. Mr. Johnson
is a chiropogist. He has ST first class

recently and it meeting with a large
sale in Burlington among the musi-.
cians and musical critics of that
town. She presented a copy to us
and the people Who have heard it
speak highly of it in Des Moines. We
commend herfor her ability and ef
fort. Mr. W. M. Ra gland is still
working at the Delany hotel. He is
a reliable citisen. Mr. John Olai
bourne is still a blacksmith and work
ing in the same shop. He is a splen
did artist in his profession. Mrs.
William' Ashby, Matilda Johnson, Eva
Jackson, Mrs. E. Williams, Katie
Boyd, Mrs. J. H. Brooks and Mr. ano.
E. Johnson are all living in the same
place and doing as well as could be
expected. Mrs. Josie Bland has mar
ried since we were last in this town
and is still running a rooming house,
also Mrs. L. Able. Mr. H. T. Moore
ter Mason last April 14th John D.
Reeler, present grand treasurer of
Mason City. Isaac L. Brown of Mar
shalltown held the largest number of
years grand master. William H.
Milligan of Cedar RapidB holds the
second place in length of service as
grand master. Edward T. Banks of
is working at the Tama building. He
owns a home in the suburbs of the
city. Mr. John R. Johnson on West
Barrett street irstiH running & truck
garden and chicken farm. He is do
ing well, considering the season. It
does seem tome someitmes it is nec
essary to deviate from the observa
tion to express our feelings as to the
carelessness of some of the subscrib
ers in paying their subscription. It
seems as though some of the sub
scribers try to beat us out, or rather
fail to pay. They seem to have an
excuse that they do not know when,
we are coming, when we have s6nt
them cards and they have received
them or some member of the family,
but they do not pay any attention to
the card. And the others have an
excuse by saying that it is not our
pay day. It seems me that if they
know we are coming they would try
and pay that $1.50, as we are only
there once a year, and cannot be there
for every pay day. Although we
have a great many honest subscrib
ers who pay every year, we do not
mean them, but praise. We are go
ing to write those members who
promised to pay, as they said they
would send in a day or so, and we will
wait and see if they mean to keep
their promise. Or if they fail to pay
our collector in the representative's
absence. Our next stop was in Fort
Madison, not at the penitentiary, but
with the citizens of that town. Here
we find about 200 colored people liv
ing. All of which are doing well.
Among them isMr. R. Harper, who
owns a small truck farm and is rais
ing chickens and hogs, and is making
a great success. He has several
daughters, all grown, and he is edu
cating them. Most of them passed
through high school and now are in
the universities. Miss Francis is in
Chicago attending the university, tak
ing a summer normal course. She
has taught several years in Illinois.
Her sister, Jennie, is still at Wes
leyan university, and another one is
a hair culturist in Chicago. Mrs. C.
W. Eubanks is still in the hair dress
ing business on Front street and has
a large business. She is an adept in
this line of work, and has the trade
of this town. Mrs. Ambrose Jackson
is living in the same place. Mr. and
Mrs. Payne, 1024 Fourth street, are
still there. Mr. Payne's health is
much improved arid so is his wife.
They are real race people. Mr. and
Mrs. Murphy own valuable property,
also Charley Turner. Mrs. M. Mack
owns valuable property at 1302 Des
Moines street, also Mr. Henry,' 226
Spruce street. Miss Jennie Harper
will chronicle the news from Fort
Madison this year. Both churches
are doing well, both have a pastor,
whose names I cannot recall at this
time. There are no secret societies
in this town, but several farmers liv
ing in the county, and'they are doing
well.
We forgot to state that Mrs. M.
Ashby, 1021 Brook, street, will repre
sent Burlington this year and as our
