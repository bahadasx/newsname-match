PROPOSED LIN
BE PUSHE
I. F. Jacobs, Chairman of the
Finaace Committee, Gives Out
Interview?Says People in the
Three Counties Must Give Fullest
Co-operation in Order to
Bring Results.
i
The proposed electric raliw&"y from
optiiiauuurg to Clinton win eventually
be built and built along lines of which
the people will be proud, says J.
"erdinand Jacobs, chairman of the
finance committee of the board of
corporators, in the accompanying article
which has been contributed to
The Journal. In order to succeed
in the movement which is now well
under way, Mr. Jacobs says it is nec
essary for the people of the three
counties?Spartanburg, Union and
I.aurens, to give the fullest cooperation
n,ot only in the matter of sub
s'-ribing liberally to the stock, but in
giving rights of wa*y, free franchises
and promises of good business, after
the road is completed.
Mr. Jacobs is sanguine over the
prospects for every success of the
venture and is entirely gratified with
the present progress of the work in
general.
The following is the interesting article
contributed by Mr. Jacobs:
"Mr. Reid Tull, formerly with the
Piedmont and Northern railroad, was
employed by the finance committee of
the board of corporators, Carolina
Rapid Transit companv. as chief en
gineer, and ha's been given authority
to organize a surveying corps and to
survey the line to connect Spartanburp:,
Clinton, Union and Laurens.
"A commission was issued by the
secretary of state some time since to
the hoard of corporators, and the finance
committee is operating undo*instructions
from the general board
of corporators to have the line surveyed
and to make up an engineering
report, secure rights of way, etc.
Mr. Tull has employed a right of
way agent who works with the sur^
-wejnng squad. . ?
"Two lines or more will be surveyed
and rights of way will be a'sked on
all lines that are surveyed. The final
adoption of a route will depend upon
the degree of cooperation secured
from the people on the routes; at least
in a large degree their cooperation
will be effective in locating the line.
If the people on a given route do not
give the rights of way and fail to
otherwise support the road from the
standpoint of stock subscription, it
is very certain that they will not secure
the location of the road, for
this line must be built by the people
of Spartanburg, Union and Laurens
counties if it is built at all.
"There will be no difficulty in floatin?.'
bonds to the amount of several
millions of dollars provided the rights
of way can bo secured and a stock
subscription with the territory cover<h!
approximating $500,000.00. It will
be necessary therefore for all sections
and for all of the terminal points to
.!> their part and to do it liberally
if the line is to become an accomi?!i<hed
fact. The proposition to build
a -ombined freight and passenger line
of good grades and easy curvatures
and to equip it with first class equipment
for the handling of fast pas^ppfnr
eprvifo nntl hpow frniu-Kf c/?v
vice originated with the people of the
throe counties.
"Financiers in the North and West
a're already interested in the proposition.
Proposals have been made by
several concerns, but in order to make
the litie the success which it ought to
be made it would be absolutely necessary
for the people to finance it
strongly, and their best interests will
be conserved by having the road
owned, built and operated by the
people of the three counties, with no
stock issue other than the common
stock subscribed by the people and
with no obligations other than the
bond issue necessary to secure the
bulk of ihe money with which to build
th? line.
i "s article is written in order
that the people of the three counties
t> y understand that the line will not
be in a position to buy rights of way,
an 1 that impediments put in the way
of 'he development of the proposition
wi".! ;;d to kill it, or at a'ny rate to
divert it from the routes in which the
impediments occur.
"It is the purpose of the finance
committee to put this road on paper
and then lay th ewhole proposition befo
" i he people of the three counties
with full data upon which to act. The
engineering report will show the probable
income and cost of operation, and
the probable earnings gross and net,
with 'he probable cost of construction.
fixed charges and 1 i"kely surplus
of deficit in operation.
"Now in order to make a success of
the proposition, it will be necessary
for the citizens of the three counties
E MUST
ID TO SUCCESS
to realize that the heartiest cooperation
will be needed by the line on
every point; first, on the matter of
free rights of way; second, on the
(matter of liberal stock subscriptions;
third, on the matter of free franchises;
fourth, on the matter of promises
of business.
"The line, if it is built, will be an
independent proposition, cooperating
with all other railroad lines which it
touches, with no special support from
n*ny line. Its greatest success and
largest earning capacity will be conserved
adhering to that policy. It is
highly probable that the line will be
received in a friendly way by all railroads
with which it connects, provided
only that it is not dominated
by one of the lines competing in the
Piedmont section. It must be a* people's
railroad, owned, constructed and
operated by the people. If the people
do not give this cooperation, the line
will not be built. If they do give the
Vooperation indicated above it certainly
wil lbe built and built along
lines of which the people will be
proud.
"It is the writer's judbment that it
will be a very profitable property, but
the degree of its success will depend
upon the cooperation of the people. If
they do not own it, it will not be a"nythink
like as great a success. This article
is intended to demonstrate that
the Carolina Rapid Transit company
will live by the favor of the people of
the three counties and will exist by
thier activity a'nd cooperation, and
without it that activity and coopera
tion will not exist at all."?Spartan?urg

German Submar
Pi
Norfolk, Va., Auk 2.?The German
merchant submarine Deutschland
passed out the Virginia capes at 8:30
o'clock tonight apparently unobserved
by the allied warships waiting for her
and, so far as kfiown here, is now
safely on her homeward voyage. No
untoward incident marked the departure
of the giant submarine. She
was accompanied only by her tug and
a' newspaper dispatch boat when she
began an 18 mile dash from lower
Chesapeake bay to the capes. After
proceeding slowly most of the way
down, she increased her speed at 6:30
and reached the capes just after dusk.
None of the allied cruisers was visible
as she passed through.
Whether she submerged before
reaching 'the three mile limit is unknown.
The two accompanying boats
report that she disappeared unharmed
and apparently had a clear field ahea'd
to a point where she could submerge
in safety.
Within half an hour after the last
light of the Deutschland disappeared,
her tug, the Thomas F. Timmins, hove
into sight seeming satisfied with her
work and headed up Chesapeake bay
in the direction of Baltimore, from
which place the Deutschland sailed

The Bremen, sister ship of the

the Deutschland's departure, thus far

The Deutschland started for the
capes after arriving early today at a
cove up Chesapeake bay.
For several hours prior to the
Deutschland's final dash for the capes I
she was hidden near Tangier island,
50 miles above Cape Henry. The
steamer Somerset and the government
buoy tender Ivy reported during the
afternoon that they had passed her at
that point. The press boat then took
a position near the dividing point of
the Old Point and Cape Henry channels
and awaited the coming of the
undersea" vessel.
Shortly before 6 o'clock the first i
sight of the craft was obtained. Apparently
she was about five miles

beat made for the same channel they
afaill changed their course and headed
directly for Cape Henry.
As the ^eutschl&Yid came on it was
apparent that she was carrying a
false superstructure, slogly lower
than her conning tower. It was straw
colored and blended with the oil skin
coats worn by her crew who crowded
the deck. When about a mile from
the press boat the submersible bega*n
to clear away the false superstructure
and take soundings as if preparing to
dive. The Timmins moved ahead of
the undersea liner and signalled that
she intended to pa'ss on the starboard
side. Immediately both vessels increased
speed and put over to the
starboard.

THIRTEEN MILLION BALES
IN PRESENT COTTON CROP
Government Report Indicates Sudden
Decrease in Prospects Owing to
Damage During July?Condition
in South Carolina
Placed at 55.
Washington, Aug. 1.?Heavy damage
to the growing cotton crop between
June 25 and July 25 has caused
a reduction of 1,350,000 bales in the
prospective production. The Aucust
cotton report of the department of
agriculture, announced toda'y, indicated
q production of 12,91fi,000
equivalent 500 pound bales compared
with 14 200,000 hales forecast
from the condition of the crop June
25. The condition during the month
dropped 8.8 to 72.3 per cent of a
normal.
Reviewing cotton conditions for the
month, the bureau of crop estimates
said: "The month ending July 25 ha's
been only fair for cotton in most of
the belt west of the Mississippi river
ihnd in Tennessee and unfavorable
east of the river and in Louisiana.
"Rains in the drought stricken
southern coastal region of Texas permitted
the planting of a' considerable
late acreage. The crop in the Western
belt is well cultivated and moisture
conditions have been favorable,
although the need for rain is now beginning
to be felt.
r,asi, 01 tne Mississippi a severe
tropical storm through portions of
Florida, Alabama and Mississippi
early in July and an extremely heavy
downpour at mid-July in the Carolinas,
together with heavy and almost
constant rains during July throughout
the entire Eastern belt have put the
crop badly in the grass, leached out
much of already deficient amount of
fertilizer and greatly facilitated the
activity of the boll weevil, where
present, and its continued spread. The
rains at the close of the period in
the Eastern belt were preventing
much needed cultivation."
? - * At ..I
v uiKiuiun en me growing cotton
crop on July 25 indicates ti total production
of 12,91(5,000 equivalent 500
pound bales. That compares with
14,266,000 bales forecast last month
ty the bureau of crop estimates
basing its calculations on the condition
of the crop on June 25, and with
11.191,820 bales, last year's final production,
