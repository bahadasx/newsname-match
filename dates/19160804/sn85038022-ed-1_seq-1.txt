Tka following Is an exterpt from a
letter of the President of the Women's
Clubs of the Bute of Keatucky:
"Echoes of our splendid Maysvllle
convention are reverberating from
club to club, and we hope ere another
meeting the spirit of Federation, so
apparent there, will have reached not
enly every club In our state but ev
ery woman. To the Maysvllle club
women and every citizen of Maysvllle,
we owe a debt of gratitude, for never
have we received a more whole
hearted and cordial welcome. Every
one vied in doing us honor and our
appreciation is beyond words. ' Four
clubs have come into our union since
the convention. It was voted to ren
der all the assistance posetble to the
Illiteracy Commission in this, its hour
of stress. We appointed a large com
mittee of active club women one
hundred to meet In the House of
Representatives at Frankfort on June
30tb. The meeting was largely at
tended and great enthusiasm display
ed as the women agreed to raise $10,
000 to meet the needs of the commis
sion. With each member raising $100
the work will not be hard on any one
Several hundred dollars have already
beeeen sent In, and we believe the
fund will be collected by the time the
moonlight schools start, the 14th of
AuguBt. The club women who so gen
erously responded to the appeal for
little deaf and blind Oma Simpson at
Maysvllle will be glad to know their
gifts were deeply appreciated and thv
little "girl will have a happy summer
with her teacher, Miss Alcorn. She
herself wrote me a very nice little
note of thanks on the typewriter."
A committee of one hundred women
have been appointed from all over the
state to raise this money. The Mason
County Woman's Club has agreed to
raise $200 and for this purpose they
have prepared socks which will be
distributed and persons will be asked
to put In some money for this work.
The amount asked Is one cent or. as
many more as possible. The ladies
feel that they wlU be able to secure
their portion In a ahort time.
This Is a great move In Kentucky
right now. Every person should be
able to read and write and those who
can should aid the more unfortunate
ones. Will you aid In the work?
SOMB CROWD
Was the One That Went to RJpley to
Attend the Fair Yesterday Five
Hundred Went Froat Here.
One of the largest crowds that ever
left Maysvllle all at one time, Jour
neyed from this city yesterday morn
ing en the 9:30 C. & O. westbound ac
commodatlon for Ripley. Over 300
round trip tickets were Bold from the
Market street Station to taat village
and IT one way. Almost a hundred
were sold from the depot making al
most Ave hundred that went on this
train alone. The attraction waa the
Ripley Fair, one of the best and most
well known fairs in Southern Ohio.
In addition to the large crowd that
went on this train a great number
went by auto and boat from this city.
The pleasure boat "Outing" and sev
eral others were loaded at each trip
and several autoes did a large busi
ness. It Is estimated that over seven
hundred people from Maysvllle and
vicinity went down.
A great number of those that went
did not go for the purpose of seeing
the fair. Wheu they departed their
tongues were hanging out but upon
their return they had lost this visible
means of thlrat and the necks of buu
dry bottles protuded from their vest
ment. The crowd waa very orderly uot
wlthatandlng the visit ta the oasis. Of
ficer Flier was sent to South Ripley
to handle the crewd on the return
trip and he reported that the crowd
was so good thai be did not have to
call one person. No arrests were made
and all went off amothly. The police
anticipated some trouble but war.

Girls' Gingham and Percale
Dresses Under Price
"I always find the prettiest and most girlish styles in your store," said a mother the olher day, and these are just such
dresses. That they are offered at reductions merely means we are desirous of a clearance. Kxcellem gingham and psr
calea in plaids, checks and plain colors, neatly trimmed and well made. Sizes 6 to 10.
Ye could not possibly buy these dresses at wholesale for the price at which we offer them. But the insistent cry for
"something new" compels us to close out the stock now so we can have an entirely new assortment for the coming season.
Mothers lose a splendid bargain opportunity who fail to sec these attractive little frocks.
