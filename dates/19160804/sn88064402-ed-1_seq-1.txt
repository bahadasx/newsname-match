THE DEATH OF P. P. UNKEL I
In chronicling the death of Mr. P.
P. Unkel, or *Pete," as he was fa.
miliarly known throughout this entire
section of the country, which occured
Thursday morning at eight o'clock,
the Journal records one of the very
sad events in the history of the com- pet
munity.
Mr. Unkel and his wife were both
stricken with typhoid fever a little a
more than three weeks ago, just fol. tat
lowing the recovery of their little he:
daughter from a long spell of illness. ho,
They were removed to the home of del
Mr. Unkel's parents, Mr. and Mrs. P. Br
J. Unkel, south of Welsh, where every ad,
attention and all that medical skill thi
could accomplish was rendered, and he
although Mr. Unkel's condition was
considered very serious, his ultimate
recovery was hoped for; thus the entry W
of the grim reaper has cast a shadow
gloom over the entire community.
Mrs.'Unkel and the little boy, Pete,
Jr., are still very seriously ill. let
Peter Paul Unkel was born at W
Sterling, Illinois, thirty-five years ago, Tr
t coming with thie family to Louisiana na
when about ten years of age. The est
family resided north of Jennings for
a short time, then came to Welsh,
t where they have since resided.
December 19, 1906, he was married
to Miss Alida Arceneaux, daughter of
Mr. F. A. Arceneaux, the present fri
police juryman from Ward seven.
A successful farmer and a good Po
business man, he has served in Im- re:
I portant capacities, in every instance
making good. His attractive person. we
- ality and cheerful disposition have we
made for him a close personal friend gi'
of every acquaintance, and this way he sr
became popular wherever he is known. by
lHe was manager of the Grand Canal
for a time, and then of the Lowrey
Plantation for a number of years un.
e til last year when he farmed just north
of Welsh, and was engaged in exten. o
sive farming operations near Kinder P.
this year. nil
The family of which he was a memr er
ber is one of unusual prominence in the Tai
community, in culture, in honor, and tw
in usefuliness, all of which winning c
qualities the deceased possessed to a nu
B marked degree. ca
t Besides a loving wife and three
children, Francis, Pete Jr., Elizabeth
the deceased is survived by father and
mother. Mr. and Mrs. P. J. Unkel, three Mr
brothers, Winn, Leo and Henry and de
three sisters, Mrs. Dr. R. R. Arce. at
neaux, Masses Katie and Vernie 1tnkel. W
Funeral services were held at the an
Catholic church this, Friday, morning it.
at 10:00 o'clock, and interment in the
Catholic cemetery, ca
The largest crowd that has as- fy
sembled at a funeral service in Welsh pi
for a long time gathered to pay their
last tribute to a kinsman, friend and
neighbor. Besides friends and rela
tives from every part of the parishi, pl
numbers were present from Lake
Charles, Kinder and other places, In* M
cluding a delegation of members of i
the Calcasieu Council K. C., of which fe
the deceased was a valued member, hii
The sympathy of the community is hij
extended to the sorrowing family in
their grief. ye

In answer to the request of many
grr
friends for information as to the thr
troop movement, country, climate, to
cot1
pography, etc., I take this means of joi
reaching all.
e Our encampment at Camp Stafford SO
was merely a preparatory move to
e work the new men into shape and
l give them discipline. There was con
e siderable discomfort at first, caused sio
by lack of equipment; in fact a num- one
ber of the men slept on the grouni Au
until we reached Donna. est
We received orders to move to the spe
border on July 17th, entrained at 1:30 tor
r p. m. on the 18th. Stopped in Jen- ish
nings to take on donations of the gen- wo
i. erous citizens. Were met in Welsh by Ric
e large crowd of friends. Were given on(
1 two sleepers at Echo, which added the
Z considerably to the comfort of the Sta
men. Were given free breakfast, post
cards and baths in Houston, where we P0
were received in true Hustonian style.
Our original orders were to go to
a Mercedes, Texas, but we received or- ses
6 ders to.move on to Donna. Arrived tut
at Donna at 9:00 a. m., July 20th, hot. ish

There is not an insect, or annimal or
plant that is not either equipped with dic
e thorn, sting or poison. Even the acr
SMexican, whom nature failed to equip Ho

his knife that it is almost a lait of hai

yesterday, and have become so used yei
to gnats in my food that it would not ar
a taste right without them. We are
fixing up now, floored our tents yes
terday and will screen them tomor
row. We are doing this at our own
expense, as a matter of self preser- Co
vation. Ve
Several of the boys have been sick, in

and stick a needle in us every day, th
just to keep in practice. br
A couple of Mexleans attempted to ou
kill one of our guards a few nights co

BEGIN NEXT MONDAY
Harvesting of one of the best and far
probably the most profitable rice crop mei
Uni
ever produced in this section will be- 26,
gin not later than next Monday, pro- Lo
viding the present favorable weather The
prevails. Mr. W. B. Gabbert reports met
that harvesting on the Gabbert & Mc- are
Millin crop of Early Prolific will be- an
gin next Monday. They have about T
one hundred acres of this new variety tens
which is very promising. It is earlier pre
by ten days than the Honduras va- A
riety, and pr~omises a heavy yeild of
and
a very excellent quality of rice. A a
number of other farmers in this sec
tion have fields of Early Prolific T
which the.' will begin to harvest at all1
about the same time. The
The Early Prolific will be followed of
closely by Honduras( Blue Rose and Dal
the Japan varieties, making a har- Car
vest a continuous performance from T
now on. Will
The acreage in rice this year F
throughout the parish is probably a
little larger than last year, and the
prospective yield is much larger. The A
season, especially the latter part, Sur
has been unusually favorable, and er
granting that favorable weather rules mu
throughout the harvest season the Ho]
country should have occasion to re- cer
joice over great prosperity. Fat
