IT'S FOOLISH TO SUFFER
When So Many Stanford People Are
Pointing The Way Out.
You mav be brave enough to stand
backache or headache or dizziness.
But. if. in addition urination is dis
ordered, look out! If you don't try
to fix your sick kidneys, you may
fall into the clutches of a dangerous
disease before you know it,n But, if
you live mpre carefully and help
your kidneys with Doan's Kidney
Pills, you can stop and avoid future
danger as well. Don't experiment
use the remedy Stanford people are
publicly endorsing. Read this case:

CHAUTAUQUA AT HUSTONVILLE
Much Interest Being Aroused In Big
Event Next Week.
"A long pull, a hard pull and all
pull together" seems to have been
the motto selected by the people of
the Hustonville section when they
began to work up interest in the
Chautauqua, which begins at Hus
tonville August 11 and continues
four days, for every man, woman
and child in that end of the good
county of Lincoln is boosting to the
utmost the delightful series of enter
tainments they have in store. And
well they may do so, as they have
not, nor will they again soon have
a more delightful treat. Stanford
had her first Chautauqua in June,
and the I. J. predicts that not an
other year will pass without its Chau
tauqua week. And there is a reason.
The entertainers sent out by the bu
reaus are high-class people and they
edify as well as entertain all who
hear and see them. There is some
thing pleasing about the recollec
tion of each of the numbers given
and something that makes one want
more of the same sort.
The Hustonville folks have an un
usually good program and that many
from the surrounding towns will go
and help them enjoy it, is certain.
Quite a number of Stanford people
have bought season tickets and oth
ers will do so before Chautauqua be
gins. The first day, Friday, August 11,
has been made "Homecoming Day"
and every ex-Hustonvillian in these
diggings is expected to be on hand
and get his good share of the good
things the Chautauqua affords, as
well as enjoy the hospitality of the
cleverest people on top of ground.
Hustonville is but another name for
hospitality and the people there will
exert themselves more than ever be
for to maintain the enviable record
she has had for the past half hun
dred ye,ars. It will be a great day
and if you miss it, you'll be sorry
for a long time.
Three programs will be rendered
each day of the Chautauqua one in
the morning, at 3 in the afternoon,
and in the evening. This is going
some, but the week is to be a gala
one and the West Enders want to
get all the pleasure and delectation
possible out of the rare entertain
ments that are awaiting them.
Go and insist on your friends
meeting you there. The I. J. pre
dicts that-you will be more than re
paid for the time and trouble ex
pended and is willing to back its
judgment in the premises.

HUSTONVILLE
A very happy event occurred on
Sunday, July 23d, at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. C. M. Back, of Huston

ered in the old home for a reunion
of the family which had not been held
for the past 12 years. The day was
spent in conversation, recalling hap
py times in the past when the chil
dren were all at home. At noon all
were called to the dining room where
a" good, old-fashioned dinner was ser-

makes the town look dull, sleepy and
unattractive, dirty and causes the
strangers to think that we are not
progressive but a very careless, in
dolent people. Let us not be like
the old clock which says "take your

Renzo King, Wouiv f in Head By
Blow from Corn Knife, Dies
at Moreland Wednesday.
Renzo King of Moreland, who was
cut on the head by a corn knife in
the hands of John Baker, of the
same community last unday, lingered
until Wednesday night when he pass
ed away. After the few lueid mo
ments, he had shortly after being
wounded, he did not regain con
sciousness again, and passed away
without having made any furtfeer
statement about the affair. The ex
planation he made o the attack
when he was conscious for a short
time, was that Wm. Baker and Levi
Kelley held him while John Baker
struck him.
Feeling is rather high in the West
End over the affair. The charge
against Baker has been changed to
a murder charge. His examining
trial had been set for today, Friday,
but owing to King's condition, was
postponed till Tuesday when he will
have his examining trial on a mcr
der charge.
Prominent residents of the West
End do not hesitate in declaring thafc
a strong case or premediated and
cold-blooded murder will be made
out against Baker, and it is said to
be probable that efforts will be made
to hold Wm. Baker and Kelley as
accessories. One West End citizen
told the I. J. representative that Ba
ker became angry because King had
teased him, and threatened to "get"
him; then went home, secured his big
corn knife and returned to the place
he had left King with his brother,
Wm. Baker and Levi Kelley. It was
alleged by this man that Baker toid
his brother and Kelley to hold Kiag
and that they did grab him and held
him while Baker struck him in the
head with the knife. This tale, it
is understood, Wm. Baker and Kelly
deny. They were the only witnesses
to the tragedy. Threats made by
some of this bunch before the affair,
are said to have been narrated since
and all three may find that they are
in a peck of trouble before they are
through with it.
The body of Mr. King was taken
to his old home in Casey county Fri
day and laid to rest in the Poplar
Grave cemetery Friday morning. J.
L. Beazley, of this city, went up and
embalmed the body for Undertaker
Pruitt, of Moreland.
