X Why Business Interests In North Arc

1 of the Present Governor.
"The Provo Post, on July 7th.
R lished what vc believe to be one of
the greatest indictments against a
public official ever produced in the
state of Utah," says the American
Eiulc, published at Murray, Utah.
"If the same is true, which it no
doubt is, it constitutes the greatest
scandal the state of Utah has ever
known. We arc told that when
Governor Spry was elected to the
highest position the state of Utah
could offer him, 8 years ago, he did
not hold a single office in the many
companies mentioned In the Provo
Post indictment, so that in the
short space of 8 years time, we
have a governor of the state who
lias used his office from all indica
tions, for personal gain.
"From an ordinary man of mod
erate means and no more conspicu
i ous in ability than the average, or-
s dinary man of moderate means, lie
has apparently arose phenominally
t to a man of predominating wealth
and power. So much so that he
lias been sought after and placed in
an official position in a score or
' more of business institutions of the
state, and many of those arc dcal
l ing directly with the state, and
hv-"ir- .,must necessarily comcunder the
r -"i""" supervision of the governor of the
; state in an official capacity, as the
people's representative, to properly
1 regulate and control them.
I 'b "The statutes of. the state of
( " Utah make it a crime for any pub-
I lie official serving the people under
oath of office to be an official mem
ber of any firm, partnership or cor
poration which is party to or inter
I estcd in a contract or any business
which their oath as a servant of
the people would require them to
supervise, to safe-guard the inter
ests of the people. Yet we find
Governor Spry closely affiliated
with many of the corporations of
; the state which his high office re
quires him by law to supervise in
the interests of the people.
, $ "Two terms as governor of the
state should be enough Tor any cit
izen, especially for a man who has
used his office for personal gain.
The article from the Provo Post
follows, and we would advise our
readers to follow it to the end and
read the Provo Post editor's com
ment on a governor who is using
his office as a recruiting station for
personal interest:
"IS THE SPRY-KEARNS
COMBINATION FREE FROM
THE OFFICEHOLDERS"
X, "A meeting wns held the other night
1 in the Utah hotel by the friends of
Governor Spry, to demand his rcnomi-
fi nation and election.
fj "In substance the Salt Lake Tribune
1 states that the meeting was the most
unique and largest ever held in the
state of Utah. That it was virtually
j free from office holders, very few be-
Ing in attendance, and that those prcs-
1 cnt were for the governor for patriot-
ic reasoiiB and had no political or ul-
,' ferior motives.
"So that the peoplo may have a
chance to judge for themselves, The
Post nrints the names of nearly all
i those printed In the list furnished by
the Salt Lako Tribune, and gives the
I occupation and business and political
I standing of those montioned. Tho
