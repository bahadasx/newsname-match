NO PARALYSIS
AT GOOD WILL,
DOCTOR SAYS
i Camp Officials Declare Child
Who It III Merely Has
'Tonsilitis.
SEE NO DANGER OF SCOURGE
ttttement Is Made on Author
ity of Physician in Charge of
Kiddies.
Emphatic denial that there even
wu a suspicion of infantile paraly
sis at Camp Good Will was rriade
today by Acting Secretary Faust,
of the Social Service House, which
has supervision of Camp Good
Will.
"There never was at any time
the slightest suspicion that the
child under Dr. Heinecke's treat
ment had infantile paralysis,"
stated Mr. Faust this morning.
"The child had a very clearly de
fined, though not serious, attack of
tonsilitis. Yesterday it also devel
oped a slight stomach trouble, 'the
combination causing a convulsion
such as infants frequently have
under such circumstances.
WOMAN SPREADS ALARM.
"One of the foreign women at the
camp mw the child at the time it had
the convulsion and apparently rushfed
out of camp with her baby and stated
that a case of Infantile paralysis had
occurred. Another woman also left tha
camp, also an excitable foreign woman!
"There was absolutely no idea that
the sick child bad Infantile paralysis at
any time. Her actual ailments were
clearly defined and correctly diagnosed
by Dr. Kelneeke.
"The precautions that are- adopted at
Camp Good Will would, we are told, ab.
aolutely prevent the Introduction of In.
fantile paralysis or any other contagious
dlseaae at the camp.
Puxzled by Report.
Wa are at a loss to understand why
such a, report regarding tho camp could
be circulated, even if such persons aa
the highly excitable and naturally solid
toua foreign women, shauld start them.
We would be glad to have those women
in camp again tnat we might convince
them of their error.
, "Today the camp Is perfectly normal.
were is no excitement, ana the sick child
la doing well."

6. W. W. Hanger, of Federal
Board, Likely to Be Picked
to Take Up Controversy.
The railroad brotherhoods to
day won a victory in their dis
pute with the railroads when Um
Senate Interstate Commerce Com
mittee tabled the Newlands reso
lution directing the Interstate
Commerce Commission to investi
gate the subject of pay and hours
of service of railroad employes.
After a conference today be
tween President Wilson and Judge
Chambers, of the Federal Board
of Conciliation and Mediation, it
was announced at the White
House that the President is keep
ing in closest possible touch with
the developments in connection
with the threatened nation-wide
railroad strike.
MAY NAME HANGER.
tl Is thought probable that O. W. W
Hanger, the new member of the Board
of Conciliation and Mediation, wlU be
named as a mediator between the
ployers and employes. ,

It
The position of the brotherhoods has
been that they wanted to fight out thstr
trouble with the roads directly, but that
they would as a last resort submit te
fedlstlon by the Government board.
The railroads do not want medlatten
by this board. The railroads have rot
many Increases of freight rates in re
cent months from the Interstate Com
merce Commission, and take th rlaw
they would have a good chance of win
ning If the commission Investigated.
Considers Letters.
The Senate committee on Interstate
commerce today considered a Utter
from the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States In favor of the resolution
and a letter from the brotherhood op
posing It. The brotherhoods said that
as the matters of difference would be
the subject of mediation under existing;
law, the Interstate commerce commis
sion should not Investigate.
After discussion, accordingly, tha cosa
mlttee tabled the resolution. This means
tho law as to mediation will probablf
take Its course.
In some quarters, it is predicted that
If there Is a railroad strike on a big
scale a powerful effort will be made In
Congress to secure compulso.T arbitra
tion legislation. . .
Snmn of th railroad brotherhood lead
ers fear this nnd are opposed to It. That
the Government ownership movement
would gain great headway from a strike
Is believed, too, by many.
