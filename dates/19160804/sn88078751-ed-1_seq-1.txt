Tug Timmons' Report Relayed
to the Navy Department,
Norfolk. Va , Aug. 3. Tho Doutsch
land, the German submarine mer
chantman, passed out of the capea
and past tho three mllo limit st 8-3f
last night, recording to tho tug
Thomas F Timmlns. Tho Tlmmlns'
report was relayed to the navy de
partment at Washington by the de
stroyer Sterrett.
With no moon, mariners believed
thero was more than an even chance
that the vessel could get away with
out detection by the allied cruisers.
Tho submarine and the Timmlns were
lost to a newspaper dispatch boat, the
only vessel following them, during a
storm in lower Chesapeake bay.
Only one allied warship was seen
off the capes. It was a two-funneled
cruiser flying the British naval en
sign. Passing vessels reported that
thero were two peculiar buoys near
her. This gave rise to some specula
tion as to the possibility that a net
Viad been flung across tho channel, but
pilots familiar w Ith the waters did net
believe so
The submarine apparently was un
observed by the allied warship patrol.
Whether she submerged before reach
ing the three mile limit is not known.
The two accompanying boats only
know that she disappeared unharmed,
and that to a" appearances she had
a clear Held head to a point where she
could completely submerge In safety.
Half an hour after the last light of
tho Dcutschland had disappeared, the
Timmlns seemingly satisfied with her
worlr. turned back and hpaded up
Chesapeake bay hi the direction of
Baltimore.

Horses Cremated.
Winnipeg. Man . Aug. 3 A large
part of the plant of the Winnipeg
Paint and Glass company was destroy
ed by fire. The loss Is estimated at
5100,000. Nineteen horses perished.
True Patriotism.
Patriotism, like religion, is a matter
of service, of lifting others by lifting
up ourselves. Patriotism Is love of
country, love of one's fellow men, love
of honesty, of purity, of decency, of
courage, of fairness, and ho whose pa
triotism does not Include thee la no
patriot and ho should go nway back
and sit down when public issues are
up. In the nature of things, a grab
ber, a jingo or n spoilsman cannot be
a patriot. Ohio State Journal.
