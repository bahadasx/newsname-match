BROADER SCOPE
FOR COMMISSION
ASKED BY MEXICO
Gen. Carranza's Reply to Last
Note Accepts Suggestion
For Joint Body
NOT TRANSLATED YET
Wants Original Subjects Dis
cussed, Including Withdrawal
and Protocal
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C.. Aug. 4.—Gen
eral Carranza's seply to the last Ameri
can note accepting its suggestion for
a joint commission to adjust border
difterences. but proposing a broader
scopt for the commission's work, was
deli\ered to the State Department to
day by Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador-designate. It announces
the appointment of three Mexican
commissioners with instructions to de
vote their attention preferably to the
resolution of the points mentioned in
the previous note.
Thus the de facto government ap
parently rejects the proposal that the
commission consider other questions
than the military situation and limits
its discussions to the subjects origi
nally suggested by Carranza—with
drawal of American troops from Mex
ico, formulation of a protocol to cover
future operations against bandits and
investigation of interests which may
have promoted border raids. Whether
this will be satisfactory to the United
States government has not been indi
cated. The note was in Spanish and
when he went to to-day's Cabinet
meeting Acting Secretary Polk de
clined to discuss it until an official
translation could be made.
Hope for Karly Settlement
If it is accepted, the next step will
be negotiations between Mr. Polk and
Mr. Arredondo to fix the time and
place for meetings of the commission
ers. President Wilson already has
under consideration a score of names
suggested for the American member
ship.
Hope for an early solution of pend
ing difficulties was confidently ex
pressed by Mr. Arredondo after leav
ing the department. He said he ex
pected to reach an agreement with
Mr. Polk by to-morrow as to the date
and place of meeting and that there
upon he would wire the Mexican com
missioners with the expectation that
they would be here In at least ten days.
He said Asbury Park, N. J., or Old
Point Comfort, Va., probably would be
selected.

National American Woman's Suffrage Association; Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, former president, and Mrs. Norman
De R. Whitehouse, chairman of the New York State Wu.nan Suffrage party, were the three whose arguments did
more to cause Charles E. Hughes to announce himself for federal action on the woman suffrage question than the
work of any others.
Mrs. Catt, Dr. Shaw and Mrs. Whitehouse called on Mr. Hughes In his New York headquarters July 17 and
urged him to help the women of the country in their fight for the ballot by giving an endorsement of suffrage
"without any strings to it." Mr. Hughes listened to them attentively for more than an hour, and at the conclusion
of the interview assured them that the National American Woman Suffrage Association would be satisfied with his
stand on the suffrage question. The Republican candidate's assurances were lived up to by him both in his recent
telegram to Senator Sutherland, of Utah, and his speech before the Women's Roosevelt League at the Astor Hotel
In New York City on August 1.

Desperate fighting Is in progress
north of Verdun where the French
three days ago took the offensive and
have scored notable gains in the ef
fort to drive back the Germans who
had been hammering at the gates of
the fortress for more than five months.
After pushing to the outskirts of the
village of Fleury, three miles north
of Verdun, on Wednesday night, the
French brilliantly attacked the place
yesterday and carried it by storm.
Last night the crown prince's troops
launched furious counter attacks and
succeeded in retaking the southern
section of the village, being unable,
however, to wrest the northern por
tion of it from General Nivelle'B
forces.
British Winning
Fleury, however, is not. the only
point where the French have scored
advances. In the attack on a three
mile front east from the river Meuse
they pushed north along the river to
ward the Vacherauville wood and the
Cote du Polvre and further east at
tacked and gained possession of the
Thiaumont redoubt. They found the
Thiaumont position untenable how
ever, because of the German bombard

from it.
