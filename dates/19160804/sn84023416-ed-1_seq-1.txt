Margaret Montgomery Moore.
Tuesday, July 25th, Margaret
Montgomery Moore, weary from
long, patient suffering, passed into
that quiet, peaceful rest which the
Master promised to his faithful.
Mrs. Moore was born in South Dur
ham, Que., July 16, 1855, and was
the daughter of Alexander and Eliz
abeth Montgomery. From these
Scotch-Irish parents she received
deep settled principles which she
carried through life, and which
were the foundations of absolute
fidelity and veracity. When but
twelve years of age to her fell the
task of mothering a younger sister
and three brothers, the youngest be
ing but five months old. Two years
later the father, too, passed away
and the task of caring for the four
children became hers. Feburary,
1874 she married Samuel Moore and
unto this union were born nine chil
dren, all of whom are living: Wil
liam A., Robert, James A., ot
Brighton. Mass.: Edward, of New
ton, Mass.; Edwin, of Island Pond;
Ella J. Morris, of East Thetford;
Melissa Clark, of Essex Junction;
Effie M. and Lettie R., of Cam
bridge, Mass. Early realizing h.?r
responsibility to her country and her
God, she labored with true womanly-
skill until she achieved an almost
perfect model of a fond, self-sacrificing
mother and devoted wife, deftly
arranging and throwing around her
family all those Christian virtues
with which God and nature had so
richly endowed her.
For months Mrs. Moore has been
gradually failing in strength, until
Tuesday afternoon "the silver cord
was loosed" and she quietly accepted
the invitation, "Come unto me and
rest." The funeral services were
held Friday afternoon at Christ
church, the bearers being her five
sons and Merle Clark, a son-in-law
Interment was in the new cemetery.
The floral tributes were many and
beautiful.
sleep, mother, sleep, with your
hands upon your breast;
Poor weary hands, they needed their
rest;
Well have we loved you, but God
loved you best;
.Tis thy God giveth rest."
