JERRY LEE OF WILLLVMS
FOR COUNTY RECORDER
Williams has not been very exteps
'ively represented as to county offices
during the past few years and while
they are not asking a great deal this
?year, there are many peopfe in that
end of the county who figure that
' they ore at least entitled to a few of
tho offices that are going to be dealt
?out this fall, presumably to thoue
best fitted to serve the people. Jerry
?Lee, who is counted as one of the
'best equipped men in the west end of
the county for anything requiring
clear-headed clerical work, has decid
ed that he will accept the Republican
nomination for tho offlco of County
Recorder.
While Jerry is not so well known
in this end of the county by other
than the business men and those who
have had business in Williams, those
who know him are willing to take any
chance on his qualifications, with full
confidence that he will be able to de
liver the goods and do it to the satis
faction of all people, no matter what
may happen to be their political be
' lief. i
He has been a resident of Williams
for the past ten years, is a bona fide
resident of tho state, and one who i
, a property holder and a tax payer.
He was at one time connected with
' tho branch of the Arizona Central
bank at Williams and has held other
I responsible positions where ability
t and integrity were his chief recom
mendations. He has never held an
electivo office until recently elected
city clerk of Williams by ah over
whelming majority, which, fs good

Harry Hibbcn flagged down the
train as it passed his place and ad
vised them of the storm and possible
washouts.
The flood however had washed the
ballast out from under the ties in
such h manner that it was not notice

Mr. Hibben says the cloud burst

camo down Miller canyon 100 yards
wide and ten feet deep a perfect tor

notice of the extent of the storm,
though they were feeling their way
along when they struck the unexpect

The wreck occurred about ten miles
south of Wilaha.
Fred Holdcn Announces for
the Office of Supervisor
T. F. Holdcn, of Williams announ
ces himself in this issuo of The Sun
as a candidate for the democratic
nomination for the office of Super
visor, believing that he can fully and
honestly represent not only the people
of the west end of the county, but the
whole county as well.
Mr. Holdcn is better known throu
out the county as "Fred" Holden,
though he is officially labeled as T. F.
His first introduction to Arizona was
away back in 1881, when he came to
FlagstaC where he remained a num
ber of years before finally taking up
his residence in Williams. He is a
cattleman with a bunch of cattle that
makes him a taxpayer of a consider
able amount. This fact makes him
feel that he should be responsible tp
all other taxpayers as well as himself
in handling the county funds.
He has held many a responsible
position -during his residence ins the
county, both in the federal and state
service. He was one of the first for
est rangers appointed by thogovern
ment, was Inter a County Ranger and
has held commissions as deputy sher
iff under many administrations.
If he is favored by the voters of the
county and elected to the office, he
promises without reservation that
each and cverV section of the county
will receive an adequate share of the
expenditures of the county funds and
that he will take a special interest in
the improvement of county roads
cast and west, north and south, not
overlooking the ranch roads in the
interest of a few, transient people
who pay no taxes and aro not inter
ested in the development of the coun
ty. Mr. Holden is capable, almost ener
getic man with unswerving integrity
who would bring good executive abili
ty to tho office.
MRS. BOZENA ALLEN
FOR CO. SUPT. OF SCHOOLS
At tho earnest solicitation of
friends, Mrs: Bozena Allen, (Mr3. F.
0. Allen), has consented to make the
race for the nomination for County
Superintendent of Schools oh the Re
publican ticket.
Mrs. Allen is a splendid woman and
one of tho popular members of the
Flagstaff Woman's Club, which is un
doubtedly one of the best organiza
tions of the kind in the state. She has
demonstrated her natural executive
ability in numerous successful under
takings and has the happy faculty'of
bringing her jovial, whole-jsouled,
sunny nature to bear on many of the
cold, frosty problems that have con
fronted her, with the result there was
a general thawing and a pleasant way
out for all concerned. A happy facul
ty is very necessary in public life.
While Mrs. Allen is naturally fond
of home life, the insistent requests of
friends and the exegencies of the oc
casion, prevailed and she consented to
make the race for the office. As in
all her undertakings, having agreed
to become a candidate, will make
every effort toward bringing about a
successful conclusion to her first ef
fort in the political world, with a per
sonal practical need behind the effort.
She has been a resident of Flag
staff for the past seven years and dur
ing that time has demonstrated her
ability as a high class musician, both
vocal and instrumental, anil has given
freely of her talents to all .charitable
or other entertainments which needed
her ability to forward the movement.
Mrs. Allen is thoroughly competent
to fill the office and will give a most
creditable account of herself if the
people see fit to elect her to the 'place.
The Coconino Cattle Growers' Asso
ciation held their sixth annual meet
ing in Flagstaff last Tuesday It was
an all day session and one of the most
interesting meetings held since tho
organization of tho association. There
wcro about fifty present, representing
nearly every cattle outfit connected
vith the organization.
The association wa3 organized in
1911 with a small membership 'and
has. grown until there, are nearly 200
members who, take an active interest
in its work.
The meeting was called to order
Tuesday morning at tho Empress
theatre by President T. C. Frier.
The morning session was devoted
to "the report of President Frier, who
gave a resume of the work done dur
ing tho past year by the association
as well as the questions of import
ance which had been taken up with
the National Association and other
conventions of cattlemen.
Secretary and Treasurer H. B. Em
bach gave a detailed report of the
work done by him during the past
year and showed a handsome sum
still remaining in the treasury after
all the expenses of the organization
had been paid.
The big drift fence built by the
cattlemen and turned over to the For
est Service camevin for its share of
discussion by those 'directly interest
ed. The fence cost a total of $11,000
and is fifty-eight miles in length,
built of wire and was completed last
year.
A resolution was passed, addressed
to the State Tax Commission protest
ing against another raise in the value
of cattle, as it was understood that it
was their purpose to make another
raise in valuation this year.
Secretary Embach was instructed
to investigate the proposed increase
of freight rates on live stock .pro
posed by railroad companies, believ
ing that the present rate was all tho
traffic would reasonably bear.
E. H. Crabb, former president of
the association, made an interesting
address, urging the cattle men and
the association as a body to assist
and support .the new Arizona Game
Protective association and gave inter
esting data as to why it should be
done by all men interested in range
matters.
Mr. John Kerr, chief of grazing,
was present representing the District
' A
PHENOMINAL STORM
ON GRAND CANYON ROAD
County Attorney C. B. Wilson 'H
visited the scene 01 the wreck v
on the Grand Canyon rail-
road, where Fireman Fred Terry
was killed last Saturday. Mr.
Wilson said he was some scept-
ical as to the stories told of the
big hail storm but when on the
ground he realized that it was
really one of the phenominal
kind that happen only once in a
great many years. The storm
happened Saturday and on Wed-
ncsday when he visited the scene"
of the disaster, there were still '
some fourteen feet of hail stones
banked up in under the bridge at
that point. He avers on his
"affy" that within this bank of
hail washed down by the flood,
there were still hail stones that
would measure up to the size of
a quarter of a dollar in silver,
American. That the flood was
deep, ia evidenced by the marks
1000 yards wide and ten feet deep
left by the flood along the side
canyon walls. In many places it
showed a depth of twenty feet ?.
or more where the water had
reached the high banks in its
rush toward the railroad and $
down the canyon. Over one and
a half miles of track was abso-
lutely rendered useless.
Every effort was made to clear
up the wreckage and to get pas-
sengers through, but the extent
of the washout made it impos-!4
siblc to do more than transfer
passengers for, the next two
days after the flood.
Hugh Anderson's Son
Dies in New Mexico
Word waff received yesterday morn
ing by W. H. Anderson from his son
Hugh at Mountainair, New Mexico,
advising him of tho death of his 11
year old boy Wayne, who .died the
evening before from spinal meningi
tis. The little fellow had been ill for
several weeks when he passed away.
Forester's office at Albuquerque, also
Supervisor John D. Guthrie of the
Coconino Forest and Harold Greene,
supervisor of the Tusayan national
forest, of Williams. A telegram was
read from District Forester Redding
ton, in which he sent his regrets at
not being able to attend the meeting
as ho had intended.
W. J. Randall one of the prominent
members of the association from the
Pine country, gave an interesting ad
dress on conditions in his section of
the country, pointing out some 0$ the
drawbacks tho cattlemen in that part
of the country were compelled to con
tend with.
Correspondence from the secretary
of the National Live Stock Associa
tion was read relative to the question
of making five year ownership of
stock necessary before it coul.d be
be sold and the permit trans
ferred to tho purchaser. The Forest
reserve rule at present puts the limit
at three years. The Association went
on record as favoring the three year
rule rather than the raise to five
years.
A copy of a letter from the -Santa
Fe railroad company addressed to the
Arizona State Corporation Commis
sion showing why they should be al
lowed to raise the present freight rate
on stock, was read by T. C. McCul
lough. The- reasons given did not ap
peal to tho stockmen.
The following officers were un
animously elected for the coming
year:
President William Babbitt
Vice-President;- John Zalaha.
Secretary and Treasurer H. B.
Embach.
Mr. Babbitt made a short address
on taking the cTiair, thanking the
members for the honor and hoping
that the coming years would be as
successful in every way as the past
. year had, been for the association.
Jl 'special committee appointed by-the-
president for the purpose of pre
I paring" a banquet and special enter
tainment for the members at their
next annual meeting. There is every
reason to believe that there will be
something doing for the entertain
ment of their friends next year, for
far be it from the cattlemen to do
things by halves.
The meeting adjourned with the
feeling among the members, that it
was one of the best and most inter
esting, meetings ever held by them.

NEW ORPHEUM TO BE MOST
SUBSTANTIAL BUILDING
Most of the heavy work on the in
terior of the new Orpheum theatre
building being built by J. W. Weather
ford, is completed and ready for the
finishing touches. According to Con
tractor Reynolds, who has charge of
the work, it will be one of the strong
est and most substantial theatre
buildings in the state.
Over the stage the roof is upheld
by what is technically known as a
"queen truss" where the weight must
pull the timbers apart length ways
before there is any giving overhead.'
The balcony is held in place with
heavy beams at the front, taking the
strain from -the wall of the building,
and is held in place at about the
center with iron stirups about tho
timbers and at the end of the balcony,
underneath, are iron posts for sup
ports. Mr. Reynolds, who, has done
similar work under the direction of
architects who mako a specialty of
theatre buildings, claims that no ad
ditional, precautions could possibly be
taken that would strengthen the
structure.
As near as the layman can see at
this stage of the work, ' the interior
will be one of the neatest and best
'arranged theatre buildings in the
state.

furiated helper in his plumbing shop

Mrs. Eva Marshall Seeks
Nomination for School Supt.
Mrs. Eva Marshall is a candidate
for the nomination on the Republican
ticket for County Superintendent of
Schools and has announced her candi
dacy in this issue.
There is hardly need of telling
those who have lived in Coconino
county for any length of time, who
Mrs. Marshall is, for she has lived in
Flagstaff for' the p"ast tKirty-four
years, having made Flagstaff her
home since its very birth. She came
to Flagstaff with her husband in the
year 1883. Her husband, tf. A. Mar
shall, died in Flagstaff in 1905.
Mrs. Marshall was the first school
teacher to teach a school in what is
now Coconino county; at the time she
came here this was a part of Yavapai
county, fehe is a native of the state
of New York and comes from the
famous General Schuyler stock, whose
sole purpose was to do things.
As an evidence of her ability, Mrs.
Marshall successfully conducted the
Flagstaff postoffice from the time of
her appointment in 1906 to 1914, two
terms, until the present democratic
administration caused a change in
political affairs.
Mrs. Marshall is a graduate of the
Courtland Academy in her native
state of New York and a lady who is
held high in tho estimation of every
one of the people in the county who
have known her. She is asking for
the office at the solicitation of many
of her old time friends who believe
she is especially fitted to properly ad
minister the affairs of that office in
the best interests of all concerned and
they are earnest in their support of
her candidacy.
Judge Harrington to Register Voters
At the request of the Republican
Central Committee, who were unable
to secure the appointment of a regis

the County Recorder, Judge J. O.
Harrington has agreed to take all
registrations of those who are unable
to go to the court house for
that purpose. Phone him and he will
call on you with the proper blanks.

and others who are unable to go" to
the court house to register and vote
this fall.

dent of this section of Northern Ari
zona. For a number of years he has
made his home at Williams owing to
his railroad work. He was married
and leaves a wife and two children
who at present arc living in Los An
geles. Few of his old friends here knew
of his condition as he had alw'ays
seemingly enjoyed the best of health
and was able to withstand the hard
work and exposure entailed on brake- .
men and only a short time ago the
dreaded white plague fastened itself
upon him, and when he learned there
was no hope of recovery and that
there was left to him only a few
short days of life, deliberately short
ened his misery and ended it all in a
fit of dispondency.
There was but a brief inquest as
all was too patent why and how no
came to his death.

examination of the .development work
done, which includes over 350 feet of
tunneling which was necessary to
bring the water into the big natural
lake bed.

the big body of water has not as yet
been definitely decided upon, but there
is a proposition up to supply the town
of Williams by pipe line, also Grand
Canyon and stockmen along the line
when it is constructed.
It is a water project with many
big features behind it with wonderful
possibilities of future development.
t F. M. Gold for County Attorney
Attorney F. M. Gold, of Williams,
was in Flagstaff last Friday and-announced
his intention of making the
race for the nomination on the dem
ocratic ticket for the office of County
Attorney.
Mr. Gold is well known in this end
of the county by the business men
though better known at Williams
where he has made his home during'
the past four years.
As he expresses, it, ho 's a democrat
"born, raised and educated that way." j
When he first came to Williams, he
was connected with the Williams
News as a part owner, but some two
years ago, sold out his interest to
enter the active practieo of law at '
WilUams, which is his sole occupation
at the present ttme.
Mr. Gold was a graduate of the
Kansas University in 1904 and admit
ted to the bar in Arizona in 1914. He
is an active, energetic young man,
firm in his convictions of right and
unafraid of doing right in the face of
any opposition. Ho has built up a
good clientage at Williams during the
time that he has practiced law there
and has many warm personal friends
on both sides of the fence 'politically
who are boosting him for the office.
He is a pleasant, congenial, likeable
man and one who naturally takes well
with the people. whether you happen
to agree with him or not
S, S. Acker for County Treasurer
In this issue appears the announce
ment of S. S. "Boss" Acker forvthe
office of County Treasurer. Mr. Acker
promises the people that he would try
and be the right man in the right
place, and his friends think he has
made good.
According to the present law no
treasurer can hold this office but two
terms, and he asks that you-support
him at the coming election with the
same liberal vote you gave him two
years ago.
His motto is the same now as then,
"What is just and right for one is
just and right for all." In the year
1915 he collected $18,350.13 back taxes
that were delinquent from one to five ,
years, and not withstanding, the twice
a year payment of taxe3 which makes
twice as much work in the office the
expense of running the office has been
less than in previous years.
Mr. Acker is an old timer coming
to this country in 1877, he worked
bard and spent a good deal of his own
money to defeat the bill granting .a
subsidy to the Seligman and Prescott '
R. R. and on this county is now pay- '
ing interest on $159,000.99, their pro- A ,
portion of that debt that was assumed
when this county was formed. .
