PARIS, August 1.?Attacking simultaneously
from the northwest and
from the southeast, French troops yesterday
stormed the village of Fleury,
three miles north of Verdun and cap1
incu several hundred Germans. In
the evening, however, the Germans
!ktunchd a lwrious counter attack and
after several violent attempts succeeded
in getting a footing in the
southern part of the village. The
French today continued to hold the

heavy fighting still is in progress.
Verdun is agin in the center cf
the war stage, lhe recapture by the
French of the village of Kleury. which
had been held by the Germans for
more than a month, has caused great
elation in France. It is the first
fruit of the French slow and methodical
offensive begun three days ago
and skeins in the opinion of French
military obst rv < rs to mark an epoch in
the six months' battle for the great
fortress on the Mouse.
Germans Less Capable.
The Germans appear to he less and
less capable of operating on their old
overwhelming scale and the initiative,
^ military men think, is about to pass
/ W to the French for good.
While the German artillery continues
to l)e as powerful and as well supplied
as ever, the Germans no longer
arc able to gather the masses of troops
necessary to reap the benefit of artillery
preparation.
It is twenty days since the Germans
i made their last big attack on the right
bank of the Mense by which they obtained
more results at a heavy cost.
On the left bank of the Mouse nothing

French Throw Ilnnihs.
French bomb throwers for a fortnight
past in anticipation of the present
offensive had been creeping forward
hv the Vignes ravine west of
Kroid Torre with the object of getling
near Thiattmont by working
around hill No. 365.
The bombers first reached the [trasflery
road. They then separated into
two parties, one going 10 the eastward
toward the Thiattmont works and the
second pushing northward toward
Vacherauvilie and Pepper hill.
I.ast week the first parly stormed a
redoubt west of Thiaumont and after
a stiff fight went beyond that position.
The second party reached the little
wood of Vacherauvilie.

The whole section from Vacherauvilie
to the approaches of Sottville
thus were in the hands of the French
and the higher command judged the
time ripe to attack from all sides at
Attacked from the northwest and
the southeast the Germans in Fleury
offered desperate resistance but the
French bayonet finally prevailed. Some
Germans managed to escape to the
Vaux-lo-Chapitre wood but a majority
was taken prisoner.
To stmt up. the French in their last
three days' offensive regained all the
ground that the Germans had taken
several weeks to eonepter.
They took all the positions for a
depth of about a mile from the slopes
of Sottville fort to lite approaches of
hill No. 321 as well as in the wood

ravine. The French also installed
themselves in positions southwest and
southeast and south of the famous
Thiaumont woods.

Today.
Mont M. Mclntyre one of the
coaches of the West Virginia University
football team was a business
visitor in the city Friday. Coach
Mclntyre is calling on members of
the Clarksburg Alumni association
and looking for prospects for the
staf'- team this fall.
The training cainp at Mt. Chateau,
on the Cheat river will be opened
September 5, when twenty-five or
I thirty of the state squad will go into
Tamp and train for fourteen days
when they will be moved to Morgantown
as school opens on the
eighteenth of September. All the
old men of last year's squad and the
most promising new material will
| be at the camp.
Any local young men who are iL
tcrested in athletics are invited 10
jthe camp. Of course they will have
to pay their own expenses but they
| are guaranteed a good time.
Coach Mclntyre expects at least
lot) men out for the team when they
'return to Morgantown.
The big game this season will be

has only 1,000 students and
not more than 100 men eligible and
fit for football, Coach Mclntyre
hopes to win from the Pennsylvania
team.

Will Be Satisfactory is
Not Yet Disclosed.
WASHINGTON, August 4 -General

joint commission to adjust border
differences but proposing a broader
scope for the commission's work was
delivered at the state department to:
day by Elese A r red on do, the Mexican
ambassador designate. It announces;1
the appointment of three Mexican
commissioners with instructions to
, "devote their attention preferably to
the resolution of the points mentioned
in the previous note."
Thus, the do facto government apparently
rejects the proposal that the
commission consider other questions
I than the military situation and limits
: the discussion to the subject origlnaliv

of American troops from Mexico; formation
of n protocol to cover future
operations against bandits and Investigation
of interests which may have

will be satisfactory to the United

note was in Spanish and when lie wont

Polk declined to discuss It until
an official translation could be
made.
President Wilson already has under

letter of Stuart ! '. Hoed, secretary
of Hfato, to the executive commit too
of the Socialist party of West VirginIt,
in which lie rules that that party
cast live per cent of the vote in the
last general election and has a right
to place a ticket in the field this
year, is as follows:
Your inquiry as to whether or not
this office would certify to tin* clerks
of the circuit courts the names of the
Socialist party's nominees for presi-j
dentlal electors and judges of the supreme
count of appeals in the event
of such nominations heing made by
a convent ion called by the .Socialist
party in accordance with tin- provisions
of section 2!) of chapter 2f>, acts!
of the West Virginia legislature in
1915, known as the primary election
law. was referred to the attorney
general who wrote an opinion which
has been transmitted to you and a
copy of which is on file in the ofllce of
the secretary of state.
In discussing the legal status of
the Social ist party, the attoriey genjeral
says: j
"In section one of the primary law
a political party is defined, 'an uiilliatlon
of electors representing a po-|
litical party or organization, which I
at the last preceding general election
polled for its candidates for reprcsen
tatlves In Congress in tne several districts,
at least five per cent of the entire
vote for that olllce In the state.'
If the Socialist parly conies within
this definition of a political party
within the operation of the primary
law."
* * * * "I am at a loss who would
determine whether or not the Socialist
party would be a political party
under the definition given In the primary
law."
* ' * "I do not find in terms that
it is the duty of the secretary of state
to decide whether or not the nominations
certified to him by n convention
represents a political party as defined
In the primary law. What position
he shall take in that regard is entirely
with that ofllcer."
It will be seen that the attorney
general leaves undecided the question
as to who has authority to determine
the status of political parties In this
state.
As secretary of state I am custodian
of the election returns and am
authorized by law to certify all proper
nominations of political parties.
Therefore. I deem it my duty to Inake
such investigation of the returns of
the vote for representative In Con
gress at the general election held In
1914 as will enable me to determine
the status of the Socialist party and
my duty In the premises.

who made a brief ^oa for woman sufIrage
and heller Amuo conditions.
Miss lOudotn K.tmsny made u plea

When Mrs. Unit was Introduced the
grout audience rose to its foot and
cheered again and again. Mrs. Catt
said:
My good friends, men and women
of West Virginia: There Is no power
<01 earth that can prevent the coming
of woman suffrage. One might Just
as well put his little weak hand
against lite the .tide of Niagara In
the hope that he might keep It back
as to try to stay the coming of this
great cause of human liberty. It 1h
as certain as the sun is sure to.rise.
When the women of this state ask
the men to give the vote they are
not asking West Virginia to try a
new experiment. 1 wish that every
man and woman of this state might
join in the effort to further this
great movement. Miss IJlake has
told you of all the states In tills
neat West that have already granted
flu* vote Hut there is something
which is f;ir greater in its offoct than
Hint. We think of progress, when
we think of the great Wost Having
Indorsed this great cause and inarch- ' M
lug eastward because it is right and
Just and a success. There is a meaning
In the color of this map which I
wish that every man and woman in
llils whole country could understand.
II Is ncross our northern bordor.
There in the northern country the
women have more privileges than
we do on llils side. My grandfathers
on both sides of the family wero in
the devolution, 'order that there |H
might be established a government
of the people, in order that they
might make good tholr slogan that
"Taxation without representation is
tyranny," and It was George the
Third,' remember, against whom they
revolted because he deniod them rep- H
reseniatlon, and you remember that
King George was worsted in that
light; now there Is a George the
fifth ruling over the great empire 'MH
tnd ncross our northern border is
me of his great colonies. Except up
liero in the West where polar bcara
live where people live It is white In'
the East and grey In the West whero
women have all the rights to voto
rote except for members of parlia- Bfl
ment, a territory equal to all our
territory east of the Mississippi
river. Now, isn't It curious that wo
American women with the blood or
Die Revolutionists in our velnS,
should be traveling over the country
loday appealing to the men to give
us the vote when it might have been
granted by Great Britain?
Women Vote Elsewhere.
Ask yourselves what kind of an
Impression it is going to make. Are
they going to be us loyal, are they
going to I'eel that they have been
fairly treated by their land? There
s one grpat difference betwen these
two countries which accounts tor
this delayed privilege. In the provncc
they grant the vote by act of parliament.
Parliament passed the law
md gave the vote to the women.
That is the reason that we have been
so slow on this side, whUe we lift
our eyes north and see that our
continental sisters have out-won us
In this race. That is not all. It
was my privilege to travel In Britain,
