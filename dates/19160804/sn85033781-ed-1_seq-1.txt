RELIC OF OLDEN
BASEJBALL DAYS
Base Rail on display used
in game 45 years ago.
Howland and Wildcy
Battery.
In the window of the Paw Paw
Drug Co., is a base ball that was
used in a game 45 years ago. Boys
who think the balls used in those days
were not hard, just feel of it. The
game played with the ball in question
HI at (ioblevillc between South Ha
ven and a team of farmers known as
th( "Plow Hoys". The score was .",!
to 16 in favor of the "Plow Boys".
The ball grounds were cast of where
the old Bush Hotel stood, in a field
from which the stumps had recently
been pulled, and many of the holes
had not been tilled up. At that
time masks, pads and gloves were
unknown in the National game, and
the many "Bum" fingers that the
old boys have, indicate that every
thing was handled bare handed.
Among the members of the "Plow
Boys" who played on that ragged
field 45 yean ago, there still re
main Henry Howland (who has kept
the ball all these years) and E. A.
"Wildey who formed the battery;
James Kingsworth, O. J. Butler, Cap
Cross and C. YY. Reynolds. Frank
Rhode.-, C. H. Butler and Ad. Gleasoil
have pasicd to the great beyond, but
their memory is till green in the
hearts of the remaining "Plow Boys"
who helped swat out the 80 runs
that won the game.
KICK EOl HORSE
Ben Lofts was kicked full in the
face by a horse last Wednesday. The
animal was in the shop and Btn v. as
getting ready to .-hoe him. He
started to pick up one of its feet,
when the horse kicked with full force
striking him in the face. Ben was
unconcious for a time, and it was
thought the injury was serious, but
he recovered and it was found tiiat he
uffered from a broker, nose and se
vere cuts and bruises. He will
probably be laid up f r some time,
but even then it is fortunate for if he
had not bf en standing BO ( lose to the
hoic, it is probable that he would
have been killed.

SPEAKS WELL FOR VAN
BUREN COUNTY TEACHERS
Ninety-two teachers from Van
Buren County are attending school at
Kalamazoo Normal this summer and
many are attending other institutions
of learning. This means that half of
the teaching force of this county are
enjoying (?) this hot summer in
study. New legislation is partly re
sponsible for the large number. Cer
tificates are not now granted until
unless the applicant in addition to
applicant shall have had at least six
week's work at some normal. Cer
tificates are not renewed this year
other requirement! shall have done a
summer school of normal work dnr
ing the life of the certificate then
held and next summer this require
ment is raised and made two sum
mers. Pet these reasons some at
tend who otherwise might be tempted
to do something else these hot days.
Van Huron County ranks third in
number enrolled at Kalamazoo being
exceeded by Kent and Kalamazoo.

GRAM BEST EVER
Strong features will be pre
sented everyday. Special
features for the boys and
girls. Same platform
manager.
Many complimentary comments
are heard on the excellence of the
program arranged for the coming
chautauqua. Dr. C. E. Varney who
has had years of experience with
Chautauquas and Lyceum bureaus,
states that the program announced
for 11)10 Paw Paw Chautauqua is
the best general program he has yet
seen. Every days program will be
strong, and a greater interest should
be manifested in this event this year
than ever before. The grounds will
be located on the Old Court House
spuare, right on main street, which
will pi on id many who have always
found it a hardship to walk to the
Thayer grounds. Henry Shaffer, lo
cal manager is working hard to com
plete all the preliminary arrange
ments and everything will be ready
on time. The program will be great
the location good . and everything
should combine to make this the
greatest of all Paw Paw chautau
quas. Let ( very one boost now just
as hard as they can, for the time will
soon be here. August 19th to 26th
is the date, both days inclusive. Buy
your tickets early and offer what en
couragement you can to the manage
ment. Tickets are on sale at most of
the business places. If you haven't
already promised to buy of someone
else, The True Northerner will be j
pleased to furnish you with tickets.
A special program is planned this
year for the boys and girls. Every
boy and girl within reach of the
chautauqua will want to be in on
this. Further details of the boys and
girls program will be given later.
It will be good news to friends of the
chautauqua to know that Mr. Zim
merman, the efficient and courteous
platform manager of last year, will
be with us again this year.
The True Northerner was misin
formed in regard to the accident of
the Smith boy. It was Harold Smith
son of Mr. and Mrs. Loren Smith who
was kicked in the face by a colt. He
is recovering from the effects of the
terrible injury.
The One Register
HOMER FURNACE
is Meeting with Wonderful Success
Everywhere
They will work entirely satisfactory in three
houses out of four,
They use less fuel than the ordinary pipe fur
nace. They do not heat up the basement.
They are quickly installed. You do not have
a force of mechanics around for a long time. The
average job can be completed in one day.
If we set a HOMER in your home and it fails
to heat each and every room to the required degree
of heat, the furnace will be taken out.
Fair, isn't it?
They cost much less than the other kinds.

another big slash OUR NEW TYPESETTING MACHINE
IN THE FORD PRICE . ... ,
lb INS I Nihil AND IN UftnflllUN
Well, it has happened. Another
big cut in the price of Ford Automo
biles. Many predicted that the price
would raise for the coming year, but
instead of a raise the price has been
slashed to $.'J60 for the coming year,
beginning August 1. Packer & Gid
dings, the popular County agents for
the Ford cars have an attractive ad.
in this issue, that will be of special
interest to every prospective custom
er for a car. Packer & Giddings are
the most successful auto salesmen in
the country. This latest reduction in
the price of cars will increase their
popularity and success as county
sales agents. Read their advertise
ment in this issue. It reads good
whether you want a car or not.

Our new typesetting machine has
at last arrived and is in place. The
machine arrived last Thursday, and
Friday morning Mr. C. C. Roush, an
expert machinist from the Intertype
shops arrived to install the machine.
He started to unpack the various
parts Friday afternoon, and had the
job completed and ready for business
Saturday noon, when the first slug
cast in any newspaper office in Paw
Pan bj il own machine was made.
lie has been with us during the week
to assist in getting every part ad
justed and the operator started. The
paper this week is set on the new ma
chine. It is new business however,
which takes some time to master, so
this is hardly a fair sample of the
paper we expect to publish after
j everything is organized and we are a
; little more familiar with the opera
tion of the machine.
The above cut gives a good idea of
the appearance of the machine. As
heretofore stated, it is a Model "A"
Intertype, a standard maehine and
one of the very best manufactured,
complete in every detail. Very lew
people have any idea of a typesetting
machine. It is a wonderful piece of
machinery , weighs 3,300 pounds,
and is almost human in operation.
The public is cordially invited at any
time to call and see the machine in
operation. We naturally feel proud
of this latest addition to our equip
ment, and will be pleased to show
and explain it to our friends.
The Northerner plant is now
equipped to handle all classes of
work in a systematic, workmanlike
and expeditious manner. On new
machine, together with several r.ew
styles of job type, added to our
equipment makes our plant complete.
We shall endeavor to publish a first
dasa newspaper in every respect,
and will riv i special attention to
our splendidly equipped job depart
ment. Our large and constantly
growing circulation, makes the col
umns of the True Northerner most
desirable advertising mediums, and
we shall spare no expense or trouble
t' uivc our patrons the very best that
is in us. Whether you are a sub
scriber, an advertiser or a patron of
our job department, it will be our
constant aim to please you. We
promise you all courteous treatment
and a square deal. If you are plan
ning a piece of job work, let us fig
j ure on it. If you have some
j thing to advertise, let us tell the peo
I pie about it through the paper. If
! If you have a piece of news that will
help to make our columns more in
teresting to our readers, send it in
or call us on the phone. Feel that
you have an interest in our business,
and help us to publish a newspaper
of which we may all feel proud.
We are yours to serve and please
