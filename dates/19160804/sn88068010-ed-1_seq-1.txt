Small Vote Everywhere instate

gressman Rucker Triumphs
Over Only Argument
Against Dim.
Gardner Distances Opponents.
Ticket Generally Satisfactory.
Elections are growing quiet,
and matters of apparently less
interest to the people every year
tney are held. It is surprising
that not onlv no individual can
didate for an office can inspire
sufficient interest in an election
to bring out the vote, but com
bined field fails. It is so with
Republicans as well as Democrats
while some of the offshoots ap
pear more than fully represented
at polls.
Salisbury fbwnship was the
principal battleground in the
election this year, the contest
over one or two offices in that
precinct being vigorous and sub
acrimonious, and while the inter
est there had centered on candi
dates for judge of the eastern
district and congress, the hand
ing of the nomination lor coun
ty treasuer over to their candi
date by his opponents with grace
ful celerity having relieved the
minds in that regard, leaders
did not neglect side lines in the
form of aspirants for other offices.
While betting on results was
not marked by any big money
being placed, there were plenty
of small wagers and almost every
kind of nroDOsition. the element
of doubt concerning every race
which bore the marks of a con
' test appearing to obsess and ac-
tunate bettors to name small
sums.
The vote all over the state was
unsually light, even the cities
showing unexplainable indiffer
. ence. Candidates of all parties
suffered exactly alike. Work on
farms was in such shape that no
excuse for failure to turn out
could be located there, but that
elections are generally becoming
matters of less concern to voters
unless some financial feature
arouses, is obvious.

Our next Governor, Col. F. D. Gardner
Hon. Frederick D. Gardner won but in the gubernatorial race by a
plurality of between 10,000 and 15000.
Hon. J. M. Atkinson was second and Hon. Cornelius Roach third
in the race so far as returns to date indicate, Hon. J. P. Gordon
won the nomination for state auditor, J. Kelly Pool for secty. of
State, and of course Middlekampjr treasr. -McAllister atty. gnl.
Judges Woodson and Williams are the lucky men for the supreme
bench. Of course Hon. Jas. A. Reed will be the successor of him
self. Our next Lieut Governor will be Crossley.

Our Congressman,
Again have the voters of the
Judge Rucker their choice for the very important post at all times
but much more important for the next two years. The splendid
fight made against our home man by Hon. Ralph Lozier was al
together founded on the length of time the people had debired "Our
Bill" to fill the office.., There can be no doubt about the pleasure
the administration will feel over the return of Judge Rucker to
congress and there is no doubt about his friends all over the district
and no feeling of bitterness among the great majority of his for
mer constituency who voted against him this election solely from
the belief that it would be well to give another worthy and able man
a start." Had there been a full vote out, Judge Rucker's majority
would have been much la rger than what it is, which appears to be
about 600.

mate by some one in the crowd
