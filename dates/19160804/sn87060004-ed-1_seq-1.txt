VARIETY OF FOOD
FOR THE SOLDIERS
Beef and Potatoes Diet Va
ried to Suit The
Taste
Fort Thomas. Ky., Aug, 3. Capt.
Armstrong, United States Army, has
taken complete charge of the Quart
ermasters and Commissary arrange
ments for the troops and his admin
istration was ushered in by a com
plete change and rejuvenating of the
system of issuing commissary sup
plies.
Instead of the conventional beef,
potatoes, bacon, bread, prunes and
coffee, it will now be possible to draw
a part of the ration in beef and the
balance in some other kind of meat,
such as sausage, liver, mutton, etc. ,
while flour may be substituted for
bread and supplies not drawn or re
quired are credited against other artt
cles purchased from the commissary.
It is anticipated that the new system
will result in a more evenly balanced
ration, and that there will be much
satiffaction among the men when the
the ration can be varied from day to
day. The qualities of the supplies
is excellent and the quantity abun
dant, and the company cooks of
most of the organizations are compe
tent, but the sameness of the meals
his been the only cause for com
plaint .

SEVEN CHILD
REN SAVED
UNESS
School Inspections Resumed
by Visiting Nurse off
County Health
League
TWELVE COUNTRY
SCHOOLS ARE INSPEC-
TED THIS WEEK
The Hopkins County Public Health
League Work is being pushed again,
in school inspections. Miss Frede
rick, visiting nurse of the League,
has, with the assistance of several
physicians, inspected eleven schools
since Monday morning and is today
inspecting Suthard's school with the,
assistance of Dr. W. P. Ross of this
place. The other doctors who have
assisted Miss Frederick this week in
the South end of the County are :
T. R. Finley, W. L. Morse, of St.
Charles; M. S. Veal, Daniel Boone;
and L. E. Nichols, Dawson Springs.
Up to and including yesterday 239
children has been examined in these
inspections. There were 44 cases of
trachoma found and 22 children with
adenoids and enlarged tonsils needing
surgical treatment. The eleven '
schools inspected are Gilliland, MisV r-l
Ruth Ashmore, teacher; Cranor, Miss
Maud Blane, teacher; Hamby, Miss
Elsie Terry, teacher, Nortons. Sam
Franklin, teacher; Goodhope, Porter
Hudson, teacher; Cross Itoads, Miss
Aattie Gamblin, teacher; Ferguson,
Miss Charlie Sisk. teacher; Walnut
Grove, F. K, Beshear, teacher; Union
Grove, Miss Bonnie Beshear, teacher
Menser, Frank Dunn, teacher.
Two of the schools mentioned
above, namely, Cranor's and Fergu
son have no trachoma at all amonj
tbe pupils. The largest nuniber of
cases found in any one school were
nine cases at Walnut Grove.
The Health League work was pre
sented before the teachers institute ttf4
Dawson Springs last Thursday after
noon by Miss Frederick and Paul M".
Moore, president of the Hopkfns
County Public Health league, at
which time nearly all ot the County
teachers wrre present and showed a.
lively intercut in the subject. Ilk
Frederick was given personal assur
ance bv many of the teachers of the
cooperation when she could arrange
to visit and inspect their schools.
Miss Frederic'; was in Earlington es
teiday and slid she expecled to con
tinue the campiign actively until ev
ery rchot 1 in the County had been
in.pected. She said that the approv
al of tlu teachers and patrons cf Ihc
s hools and the proleiiional services
tre.ly given by 1I1: doctors ot the.
county were a 1 most encouraging forv
the future continuance if the bij
work of health improvement that Ins
b;cn undertaken by the League or
ganized for llu benefit of Hopkins
County. A general membership
campaign will soon be inauguratH,
before the beginning of the League s
fiscal year, in an effort to give every
body an opportunity to j i.i the
League and assist in the good work.
One very powerful argument in fiver
of the continuance and broadentii.; c f
this work came out in a atemeut
made at Dawson by Miss FieJeikk
that through the Inspection and clit
ics held in the County since lat Oc
tober at least seven chi d e i have
been saved from total blindutss,
