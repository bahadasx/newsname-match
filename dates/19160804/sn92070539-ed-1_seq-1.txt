DEMING WANTS
MDITION
Every available method being u,ed to get troops
from Border to Deming. Simply a town-boosting
proposition regardless of Border Protection
It has now been eight months since the citi
zens of Deming started a campaign to take the
soldiers away from Columbus that they might
have the advantage of their payroll. Every
means that has ever suggested itself to Deming
has been used, except they have not the nerve
to say they need the protection of the soldiers.
Last December it was thought among them
selves that everything had been arranged, and
that soon Columbus would be left without any
protection whatsoever. They thought that the
Department cf War at Washington was satisfied
that Deming was the logical place for the estab
lishment of a camp, and that the Southern De
partment had also agreed. This at the expense
of the trips of two commitces, one to Washing
ton and one to San Antonio. The matter of
the decision, finally, however, was left up to
Colonel Slocum. Me knew the situation, saw
its danger and refused to entertain the thought
at all.
Since that time we have seen several of our
most prominent citizens, both men and women,
bathed in their own blood. We have seen Co
lumbus, tnc place we call our home, looted and
burned by Mcxicun Bandits. The fact that there
is any of us left to tell the story is due to the
presence of the soldiers, and that Deming had
not succeeded in her greed for gain. After they
saw they had failed, one of the prominent citiz
ens of Deming made the remark to one of onr
prominent citizens that "they did not give a
d - - for the soldiers, that all they cared for
was the pay roll." A similar admission was
made to an officer of the 13th Cavalry.
Some of the Deming citizens, conscience
stricken, apologized to Columbus for the part they
had taken in trying to get the troops removed
from Columbus to Deming. Columbus did not
think that Deming Would ever have the audacity
to even suggest such a thing again. Wrong.
Deming is now using every conceivable
method to get the base of supplies. We are told
the assistance of a United States senator is
being solicited for this purpose. We of Colum
bus do not bilieve that the senator could so far
forget his duty to the border as to lend his as
sistance to Dcming's unworthy scheme.
It has been reported and generally circulated
that the citizens of Columbus had held up the
government in prices for leases on ground for
camp site purposes, which is absolutely untrue.
Columbus has always co operated with the
military, and recently they have been given
leases on 1280 acres of land, the same having

Petition to Remove Police
A petition is being circulated
in Columbus to Sheriff Simpwn,
asking Hint tin roinove the
civilian police which has been on
duty since the raid. Them are
now twenty seven men on the
force, twenty having been dis
charged about one week ago.
The reasons set forth in the
the petition is incompetency,
neglect of duty, brutality, pre
sence unnecessary and other
things too numerous u mention.
It is not known with what suc

of tile trucks have already been
put into service between Doming
and Columbus', taking supplies
from this point to the camp at
Deming. It is learned that a
large portion U tile supplies for
that camp will be received from
the base here.

Bootleggers Can Be !
Fined by Justice
Letter from Clancy explains that
violators of the liquor law can
be fined under ordinance.
That boot leggprs can be lined
by the police judge and the
money so collected be paid into
the city treasury is the substance
of a lottur received from II. S.
Clancy. assistant attorney gen
eral of the State of New Mexico.
In order to do this it was
necesary to pass a village ordin
ance providing a i enalty of a tine
not to exceed $100, and imprison
ment not to exceed three months.
Under the existing laws no ordi
nance prohibiting the side of in
toxicating liquors cm be repealed
without u vote, and an election
cannot be held at this time. It
was found, however, that the pro
hibition ordinance, on account of
a s'uall technicality, had not been
legally adopted by the first Hoard
of Trustees elected in thu Village
uf Columbus.
Mr. Clancy status in his letter
tluitall prosecutions for bootleg ,
ging mustcoine under the Village
ordinance. Not haying any legal
ordinance, the Trustees adopted
one, which will, in the future, give
tiie police judge the authority to
tine those who violate the liquor
laws, the tine remaining iiore ut
home.
The laws of thu state compel

ordinance or ordinances to place
the result of u prohibition elec
tion into effect. Jurisdiction in
all cases where the prosecution
is made under town or village
ordinances is given the Justice
of the Peace.
The letter from the assistant
attorney general follows:
Santa Fe, N. M. July 27. 1910
Mr. G. E. Parks,
Columbus, N. M.
Dear Sir:-
I am in receipt of your letter
of the 25th instant in which you
inquire whether a justice of the
peai e has jurisdiction to impose
a tine or imprisonment, ur both,
upon persons who are convicted
of the offenso of "boot legging".
As I am informed, Columbus
is an int orpo rated town or village,
and that the barter, sale or ex
change of intoxicating liquors is
prohibited within t h e munici
pality and within two miles of the
limits thereof, such prohibition
having been authorized by the re
suit of an oleqtlon held under the
provisions of Sees. 20-10 to 2946 of
the Codification of 1915. The last
paragraph of Sec. 29411 makes it
mandatory upon the municipal
ity, in case the majority of the
votes cast at the'electlon shall be
in favor of prohibition, to pass
"such ordinance or ordinances as
may be necessary to carry such
provisions into effect," so that all
prosecutions for boot-legging
must be had under thu town or
dinance. As to whether a justice
if the peace would have jurisdic
tion to indict a punishment upon
conviction of a violation of such
ordinance, would depend upon the
wording of the ordinance. If the
ordinance follows tho language
of Sec. 29 1H and tixes the punish
ment, "by a line of not more than
tlve hundred dollars," a justice of
the peace would only have juris
diction to hold tho accused for
action by a grand jury, but if the
ordinance provides that the
punishment may be by tine of
ono hundred dollars or loss, thu
justice would have jurfsdict Ion t

Thure wore several now candi
dates to be installed, and after a
rare and refreshing shower of
ruin, about 12 -to ovoty thing was
gotten in readiness, and the
members of the society, with a
supply of refreshments and
other necessary paraphernalia,
loaded themselves into two large
trucks, driven by Messrs. Hill
house and Sims, and started on
their journey.
Going out on the Deming road
tlvo miles, the curavan turned off
to the left and went over to a
windmill about a mile distant
from the main road. Here every
one unloaded and immediately
set to work to prepare them
selves for a real rainstorm
(which only came in part), and
to prepare for the ceremonies
thru which the candidates were
to pass. Under the directorship
of El Gringo Pequeno, the candi

Sims, Stoney, Hruhlmeier, Prey
and Faer, were carried thru
the mystic rights of the "Burn

thereafter a most serious shoot

was mostly done with a camera.

a late hour, the approach of night
sending all back to Columbus.
Columbus a Motor Truck Town
"Columbus of to day does not
look at all like the Columbus of
a year ago," said A. II. Hud
speth, United States marshal,
who returned to headquarter's
last night, after a visit to the city
mentioned, which is now the big
military base on the border.
"The New Mexico regiment Is
stationed there, and also one
from Massachusetts, in addition
to the troops of the United
States army. What appeals
most to the citizen is the enor
mous amount of work and pre
paration required to take care of
the truck trains. Tho town
seems to be tilled with agents,
salesmen and demonstrators
representing the companies
which manufacture motor
trucks. Hundreds of these
trucks are now running in and
out of Columbus, and experi
ments are being made with dif
ferent makes. The aviation corps
is also stationed there, and every
day the machines are tested nnd
tried out. Keeping the expedi
tionary force supplied, under
the present circumstances, cer
tainly is no easy task." New

Washington, J uly ill. High
commendation for Colonel Her
bert J. Slocum and his men of
the Thirteenth Cavalry for their
"prompt and valorous action" in
repulsing and pursuing Villa and
his bandits when they attacked
Columbus, N. M., last March, is
given in a soecial investigator's
report on the incident, which the
war department announced today
had been approved by Secretary
Baker.
The raid, which brought rela
tions between the United States
and the do facto government of
Mexico to a crisis and caused the
dispatch of General Pershing's
punitive expedition, was investi
gated at the department's order
by an officer of the inspector gen
eral's office attached to the staff
of General Pershing, disposed
tinally of the incident so far as
the department is concerned.
The inspector's report said-
"I recommend that Colonel
Slocum be advised that no stigma
rests upon his conduct of com
mand at Columbus at the time of
Villa's attack, and that he and
his command are highly commen
ded for their prompt and valorous
action in the repulse of Villa's
forces and the pursuit of the
sime."
Police Court Proceeding,
This has been the most quiet
wek in police court since the
raid. Very few arrests have
been made by the officers. Lieu
tenants Donnelly and Williams
paid the villngo $5 each and costs
on a charge of indecent exposure.
Ivy Edwards and Ruby Blair
paid the same tine for a similar
offense. Jose Puchi was assessed
a tine of $5 for disturbing the
peace.
