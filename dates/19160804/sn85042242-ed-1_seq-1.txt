WARSHIPS STILL NEAR
ENTRANCE TO THE CAPES
Sub-Sea Boat Submerges Twice
Before Getting Past Three-
Mile Limit
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 3.—The Allied
cruisers, patroling the entrance to
Hampton 'Roads to prevent the de­
parture of the German submarine
merchantman Deutschland, still were
in position within sight of shore dur­
ing today and there was nothing to in­
dicate they were aware of the passage
of the Deutscliland through the capes
last night. Marine men here believe
the submersible had entirely eluded
the war vessels and- was safely on her
way across the Atlantic on her voy­
age to Germany.
The captain of the North German
Lloyd Neckar who, on board the tug
Thomas F. Titnmins, directed the de­
parture of the Deutschland, said the
underwater freighter passed within
'100 yards of a United States destroy­
er on neutrality duty off the capes.
He asserted the submarine submerg­
ed twice down the bay to test her en­
gines.
"When we came to a stop at a point
in the bay, which I shall not disclose,
because we probably shall have to use
the place again," said Captain Hintz,
"the pilot aboard the submarine was
taken off the Timmins. It was then
about 5 o'clock in the morning. The
submarine was submerged that her
machinery and pumps could be tested
and the cargo trimed, should, that be
neceBsary. She wentdowfttnadeej^
hole in the bay to the depth of 136
feet, remaining there for some' time.
"When she came to the Burface
again, Captain Koenig came up
thorugh the conning tqwer and said
that everything was, working perfect­
ly. We started off down the bay and
when no traffic was in sight, the
Deutschland took another dive while
running above the water. Then I
dropped behind to see at what dist­
ance the wake of the Deutschland or
the foam crest of the periscope could
be seen. At 400 yards, with glasses,
1 could not see a thing."

Columbus, N. M., Aug. 3.—Hugh
Clark, a recruit of the 2nd Massa­
chusetts Infantry, was placed in the
stockade tonight for sending to a
home newspaper an article in which
he accused his company's officers of
neglecting their -men. The article,
clipped from a Holyoke, Mass., paper,
was sent to Columbus by the war de­
partment and a strict investigation
ordered.
After questioning Clark, the offi­
cers of his regiment placed him un­
der arrest for making false and mis­
leading statements. They say the
soldier failed to substantiate state­
ments made in the article. A general
courtmartial has been ordered to sit
in his case tomorrow.

Jamestown, N. D., Aug. 3.—Suppos­
edly influenced by I. W. W. agitators,
workmen employed by the E. C. Ev
anston company of St. Paul, on North­
ern Pacific construction operations in
this city, struck yesterday for an in­
crease from 25 to 35 cents an hour.
Their demand was not complied with,
the men laying down their tools, and
the company is now organizing a new

MERCURY GOES UP TO
WITHIN ONE-HALF DEGREE
OF JULY RECORD DAY
With 96 as the highest point
reached by the mercury yester­
day, a new record was nearly set
for the extraordinary hot spell of
1916. The hottest day in July
registered 96.5.
Children on the capitol ground*
in the afternoon adopted the fash­
ion of going barefoot after two
little girls had talked with their
mothers over the telephone in the
office of Fire Marshal Runge.
"It is so hot," they said, "please
let us go barefoot,"
The request was granted. The
shoes and stockings came off.
The other children reaming in
the park soon followed suit
do more than anything else to insure
the good health of every member of
the First.
The Fargo Forum said last night:
"So far as known no concerted ef­
fort has been made in Fargo for do­
ing its Bhare toward purchasing a
motor ambulance for the First (North
Dakota infantry, now in camp at Mer­
cedes, Texas, with an unknown period
of service before it. Other towns of
the state are getting very busy on
this proposition and some of these
towns are ones that did not send com­
panies or men to the front.
At latest reports Bismarck has rais­
ed $252.50 among its citizens and sub­
scriptions are still coming in. At Dev­
ils Lake the president of the federa­
tion of women's clubs of the city has
called on the presidents of the indi­
vidual cltfbs with a view of enlisting
these clubs in the campaign. Grafton
is busy on the proposition while all
over the state the press is urging the
matter.
At the present time the North Da­
kota regiment is provided with only
an antiquated, mule-drawn ambulance
which would not come up to the de­
mands should the regiment be called
into actual war service as there is a
great possibility it will be. A motor
ambulance is needed and it is esti­
mated that this ambulance will cost
about $2,700 delivered. It is needed
now."
EXPECTED IN
HE* DAYS
Report From Carranza On Quest­
ion of Joint Commission
Eagerly Awaited
MEXICAN MEMBERS OF
vmm
ABOARD- AiJitiADY
Washington, Aug. 3.—The final
word from General Carranza neces
sary to initiate organizatin of a joint
commission to settle border disputes
is expected in a day or two, and the
belef is the commission's work will
begin within a week or ten days. The
official announcement in Mexico City
today that the Mexican commission­
ers had been selected was taken to
mean that the American suggestion
to broaden the scope of the subjects
to be considered had probably been
discussed. Neither the state depart
ment nor any officials had been ad
vised tonight of the naming of the
commissioners.
There was nothing to indicate that
the three commissioners named,
Messrs. Cabera, Bonillas and Pani,
would not be entirely acceptable to
department' officials. President Wil
son has a score of men under consid
eration for appointment as the Amer­
ican representatives.
High Army Officer Mentioned.
There are many indications that a
high army officer will be one of those
selected. Major General Goethals has
been mentioned. The other men un­
der consideration include members of
the supreme court and men in close
touch with commercial and financial
conditions. The commission's power
will be only that of recommendation*.
Whatever plan Is proposed for settle­
ment of the border controversies, or
for withdrawal of troops, or for any
other purpose, is in no way binding
on either government.
FOR BELLIGERENTS
Violent Fighting Continues Be­
tween Russian and Austro-
German Forces
London, Aug. 3.—Thursday passed
in all the war theaters without not­
able gains for any of the belligerents.
In the Stokhod region of Russia vio­
lent fighting continues between the
Russian and Austro-Germans, while
German counter attacks against the
British in the Delville sector in
France were repulsed, and bombard­
ments characterized the operations in
France.
Battles also took place along the
Derrich and Dnietzer rivers, while in
the Caucasus region near Dalibeker
the Russians carried out a bayonet at­
tack against the Turks. In the Tra
vananzos valley, of the Austro-ltalian
theater, the Italians have made fresh
progress against the Austrians. In
the Vigge valley, in the upper Posina
regions, and in the district of Cortina
d'Ampezzo, the Austrians are bom­
barding Italian positions.

MEETINGS TO BE HELD
For Compliant of 400,000
Workmen
Washington, Au£. 3.—While the
strike vote of 400^)0 railroad em­
ployees was being ^counted in New
York, every agency affected by the
situation was doilig all possible to
prevent a break between the rail­
roads and the workmen.
MPENiC STRIKE KILL TWO MEN
TO CONSIDER ISSUE
Hours of Labor .Is Chief Cause
Wm. H. Chambers, president of the
board of conciliation, communicated
with President Wilson, though board
officials pointed ou that nothing for­
mal could be done until the railroad
managers and representatives of the
employees resumed negotiations next
week.
A ireeting called for tomorrow
morning of the senate commerce com­
mittee to decide whether hearings
will be held on Chairman Ntewland's
resolution proposing an investigation
by the Interstate Commerce commis­
sion of hours on railroads and urging
employers and employees to postpone
a settlement of their differences until
a report can be made. Hours of labor
Jb one of the chief causes of the pro­
posed strike.
Urge Action On Resolution.
The Chamber of Commerce of the
United States, which yesterday ap­
pealed to President Wilson, is urging
action on the resolution. The Cham­
ber is considering calling a confer­
ence of representatives of commer­
cial organizations to impress on con­
gress the necessity of taking some
immediate step. 4
ThcK department,,designated
G. W. W. Hanger, Assistant commis­
sioner of the board of mediation and
conciliation, as a member of the
board. The law stipulated that there
shall be three members, but Judge
Martin Knapp, chairman, and Wil­
liam L. Chambers, commissioner,
have served alone because an official
of the department of labor, designated
as a third member, when the board
was formed, was not qualified to offi­
ciate.
Judge Knapp and Mr. Chambers
asked the president to increase the
membership because the work of the
board already has become great.
Administration officials said every­
thing possible would be done to avert
a strike. If all other steps fail, it
is probable President Wilson will
make a personal appeal to the rail­
road managers and employes, urging
them to effect a settlement in the
interest of the public. The question
may be discussed at tomorrow's cabi­
net meeting.
Start National Campaign.
Chicago, Aug. ?.—A national cam­
paign among all railroad employes
not embraced in the four Brother­
hoods who are voting on the strike,
was started today to obtain legisla­
tion by congress to empower some
body to settle all disputes as to
wages between railroads and employ­
es, whether organized or unorganiz­
ed.
R. T. Frazier of Nashville, Tenn.,
chairman of a committee of railroad
employes, outside the four brother­
hoods, said petitions for such legisla­
tion had been signed by a majority of
men employed on some southern road,
and that the movement would be
made national in scope.
The committee contends that the
•80 per cent of railroad employes are
not included among the trainmen.

Mercedes, July 29.—Leaving Bis­
marck on the evening of July 22, the
First North Dakota infantry landed
here at Mercedes, Texas, late in the
afternoon of the 26th after'a^ieasant
trip. It Was raining, the firtt'time in
13 months, and the drdp du&t'thade a
splendid gumbo which, fo^ tenacity,
haB that article of the. Red river val­
ley variety .We were
marched outside toWrj1 ahf^
(aSsigned
to a field of cactus, "muskeet" and
weeds. Not having time to get up
our tents we pitched our pup-tenta
and slept in the mud. The next day
it rained, also, and after we got the
cactus and other obstacles cleared
out, the tents up and all settled for
housekeeping, the sun came out and
smiled. It was a warm reception, but
the gulf breeze makes it bearable.
The only disagreeable feature about
the climate is the fact that it remains
damp. If one's clothing is dry when
he arrives, it immediately absorbs
moisture and when once wet it re­
mains in that condition. The atmos­
phere seems permeated Witji salt and
all iron work rusts readily.'-
Exercise on Way.
We were exercised at Huron, S. D.,
Hawarden, la., Parsons, Kansas, Mus­
kogee, Okla., St. Antonio and Kings
ville, Tex. We were received well at
all places, but San Antonio did the
best of them all. We were taken to
the Alamo where Davie Crocket and
"Capt, Bowie wittf tbeir comrade?, lost
their lives many years ago. The
Daughters of the Confederacy then
treated us to ice cream and cake.
The North Dakota regiment is lo­
cated within three miles of the Rio
Grande with naught but jungles be­
tween us and the river. We are warn­
ed not to go to exceed one-half mile
without arms, and it hardly seems
possible we are in the danger zone.
But there are snipers, tricksters and
a bad class of greasers all through
this section. All railroads and bridg­
es are heavily guarded every minute
day and night. Thousands of troops
are stationed along the roads and
railroads clear up to San Antonio,
about 250 miles. A few days before
we arrived some Mexicans drew the
spikes from one rail and there at­
tached wires to it. As a troop train
approached they jerked the rail out,
wrecking the train. The engineers
and firemen were killed and 20 sol­
diers injured. The Texas rangers got
six of the greasers and shot them on
sight.
Rangers Paid by Texas.
The Texas Rangers are employed
by the state of Texas and are a troop
of detectives thoroughly acquainted
with this country. They are an in
vincible lot—all crack shots. The
Mexicans fear them absolutely. In
fact, they shoot a Mexican upon the
least suspicion or provocation, and
are never asked to make an account
ing. They merely shoot them, kick
them into the weeds and go on about
their (business. The rule is to say
nothing about the killing, but should
one tell of his act, he may be required
to make an affidavit explaining the
job—that's all.
All in Good Health.
The whole regiment is in good
(health and good spirits, and Co. A is
making a fine showing for itself. It
is located about the middle of the
line, has nice, clean quarters and the
boys are strictly on their good be­
havior. It gets dark here before 8
o'clock and 8:30 finds them in bed,
Silence reigns in camp at 9 o'clock.
Capt. Welch and Lieutenants Gra­
ham and Preston have as neat quar­
ters as any officers in camp. I, visit
with them and the boys and Co. A
nearly every evening. The boys have
been doing pretty well, but their
funds have run out. The hardest art­
icle to get along without is ice. It
is scarce here and high priced. Meats
spoil and the water is actually hot.
The boys have not received one cent
of pay since entering the service June
19, and it may be September before
they are paid. They are broke and
need at least a small fund for a few
camp necessities.
Hunt Reptiles.
The Bismarck boys are making a
record for hunting reptiles and in­
sects. They have killed two rattle
snakes, two tarantulas, several scor
peons, centipedes and other hideous
creatures.
First Lieutenant Dan Mulick, who
is assigned to the machine gun com­
pany, was badly upset yesterday,
while attending officers' meeting.

Sir Roger Casement Dies by the
Noose in Pentonville
Jail
ACTIVITIES IN REBELLION
WAS CAUSE FOR SENTENCE
London, Aug. 3—Sir Roger Case­
ment, former British knight and con
flul, was hanged at 9:00 a. m. today,
in Pentonville jail, for high treason.
Sentence of death was carried out
for his activities in Germany and Ire­
land in connection with the recent
Irish rebellion.
Deprived of Title.
Honoi'fed with* knighthood—a title
since taken from him by King
Ceorge's order—for his many years
of service for Great Britain as consul
and consul-general, Roger Casement
assumed leadership, at a period of
his country's crisis, in the recent
Irish rebellkn, the plans for which
were laid while Casement was in Ber­
lin, where he was reported to have
negotiated an understanding with the
German imperial authorities.
British naval supremacy brought
an abortive close to Casement's plans.
Tne German tramp steamship on
which there was transported an arm­
ed expedition from Germany nearly to
the west coast of Ireland in April
of this year was blown up by its own
crew when the latter foresaw that
it was inevitable that the blockading
English warships would capture it.
The crew were made prisoners. The
tramp had been convoyed from Kiel
by a German submarine, from which
Casement and a companion landed on
Irish soil, where they were taken
into custody before their plans ma­
tured.
In May, Casement was given a pre­
liminary hearing and was committed
for trial on a charge of high treason.
Late in June the trial was begun,
Casement pleading not guilty and ut­
tering a denial that he had worked in
Germany's interests and that he had
accepted German gold as a bribe.
Sentence Confirmed.
The court's verdict was guilty, and
the sentence of death by hanging was,
after appeal bv his counsel, confirmed
by the court of criminal appeal, late
in July.
The London press gpnerally approv­
ed the fate legally fixed for Case­
ment, but in America persistent ef­
forts were made to save the noted
prisoner from death. In Washington,
a resolution was adopted in the sen­
ate which would have President Wil­
son intercede with the British govern­
ment, and numerous petitions receiv­
ed at the White House from many
sources asking that a plea for clem­
ency be cabled. In England, the Man­
chester Guardian and a number of
other papers pleaded for mercy and
petitions asking for a reprieve were
circulated in London. Adherents of
John Redmond forwarded to Premier
Asquith a petition signed by six bish­
ops, twenty-six members of parlia­
ment and fifty-one other persons, in­
cluding at number of educators.
Pope Interceded.

ment's behalf, endeavoring to obtain
