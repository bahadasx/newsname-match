ALLIED CRUISERS REMAIN
OFF VIRGINIA CAPES
Nothing to Indicate They Are Aware
of the Passage of the Deutsoliland
Norfolk. Va., Aug 3. The allied
cruisers patrolling the entrance to
Il-mpton Roads to prevent the depar
ture of the German submarine mer
chantmen Deutsehland still were in
position within sight of shore during
today and there was nothing to indi
cate they were aware of thr passaae
of the Deutsehland out through the
capes last night. Marine men here
believed the submersible had entirely
eluded 'the war vessels and was safe
ly on her way across the Atlantic on
her return voyage to Germany.
Captain Hinsch of the war-bound
German lir.er N'eckar, who on board
the tug Thomas F. Timmins, directed
the departure of the Deutsehland, said
today that the underwater freighter
passed unobserved within 100 yards of
a United States destroyer on neu
trality duty about a mile off the
Capes. He also disclosed that the
submarine submerged twica on her
way down the bay to test her engines.
Captain Hinsch said it would be un
wise for him to disclose whether the
vessel went up or down the coast be
fore striking out to sea, or whether
she steered an easterly course straight
out.
Captain Hinsch returned to Balti
more tonight, leaving the Timmins in
Norfolk with instructions to pick up
a tow for Baltimlre if one could be
secured within a day or two. If no
tow is available, the tug, he said, will
go back to Baltimore anyhow.
In response . to questions regarding
the prospects of the Bremen, sister
ship of the Deutsehland, arriving in
American waters, Captain Hinsch
eaid :
"You can depend upon it that if the
Bremen was coming i.i the near fu
ture, I would not be returning to Bal
timore and neither would be the Tim
mins." He declined to say when the Bre
men was expected.

GOVERNMENT PREPARING TO
AVERT RAILROAD STRIKE.
President Wilson May Make Personal
Appeal to Managers and Employes.
Washington, Aug. 3. While the
strike vote of 400,000 railroad employes
was being counted in New York, every
agency of the federal government af
fected by the situation was preparing
today to do all possible to avert a final
break between the railroads and the
workmen.
William L. Chambers, commissioner
of the board of mediation and concilia
tion, wis in communication with
President Wilson during the day, al
though, board of mediation officials
pointed out that nothing of a formal
character could be done until the rail
road managers and representatives of
the employes resumed negotiations
next week.
A cail for a meeting was issued for
tomorrow morning of the senate com
merce committee to decide Whether
hearings will be held on Chairman
Newlands' resolution proposing an in
vestigation by the interstate commerce
commission of hours of labor on rail
roads and urging the emplovers and
employes to postpone a settlement of
their differences; until a report can be
made. Hours of labor constitute one
of the chief causes of the threatened
strike.
The chamber of commerce of the
United States, which yesterday ap
pealed to President AVilson for federal
intervention to' prevent a strike, is
urging action on the resolution. The
chamber is considering calling a con
ference of representatives of commer
cial organizations to impress on con
gress the necessity of taking some im-
meaiate step.
If all othr steps fail, it is probable
President AVilson will make a personal
appeal to the railroad managers and
the employes urging them to effect a
settlement in the interest of the public.

sacrifice characteristic of his profes
sion." The letter adds that the king
has learned with the deepest indigna
tion of Captain Fryatfs fate and that
the Icing "regards the outrage with
abhorrence."

LORD BALFOUR REVIEWS
BRITISH NAVAL SITUATION
Says British Blockade is Tighter Than
Before the Bettle of Jutland.
London, Aug. 3, 10.13 p. m. The
first lord of the admit alty, A. J. Bal
four, has issued a statement for pub
lication, in the course of which he
says :
"The second anniversary of the
British declaration of war provides a
fitting opportunity for a brief survey
of the present naval situation. The
consequences, material and moral, of
the Jutland battle cannot be easily
overlooked; an allied diplomatist as
sured me that he considered it the
turning point of the war.
"The tide, which had long ceased
to help our enemies, began i'rom tl.at
moment to flow strongly in our favor.
This much at least is true, that every
week which has passed since the Ger
man fleet was driven damaged into
port has seen new successes for the
allies in one part or other of the field
of operators. It would be ftn error,
however, to suppose that the naval
victory changed the situation; wha it
did was to confirm it.
"Before the Jutland battle, a-3 af
ter, the German fleet was imprisoned.
The battle was an attempt to break
the bars and burst the confining pates.
It failed and with Its f.iilurr-. ''.ie high
seas fleet sank ag-aln into Impotence.
"The Germans claimed Jutland as a
victory, but in essence they admit tho
contrary, since the object of a naval
battle is to obtain command of the
sea and it is certain that Germany has
not obtained that command. whilst
Great Britain has not lost it. Tests
of this assertion are easy to apply.
Has the grip of the British blockade
relaxed since May 81. Has it not, cn
the contrary, tightened?
"The Germans themselves will admit
the increasing difilculty of importing
raw materials and foodstuffs and of
exporting their manufactures; hence,
the violence of their invectives against
Great Britain."

soundly his nerves were completely '
calm."
