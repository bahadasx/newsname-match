THE REAL HUGHES
CLOSE
POISON C1P SMS i
PHOENIX, Nov. 4. Prohibition has
caused a scarcity cf labor in tbe pris
on camps and it is probable that one
of the camps will be abandoned, ac
cording to the report of the state
engineer to the state highwa com
mision Just Issued.
The report states: "We are endeav
oring to kep two prison labor camps
n operation, an honor camp of thirty
five to fifty men, and a guarded camp
of from 75 to 100 men. It is possible
however that we will have to abandon
one of these camps as the number of
prisoners in the state prison has de
creased to such an extent since the
passage of the prohibition law that it
is doubtful if we can secure a suf
ficient number of men in the two
camps."

to RESUME WORK
SPREGKLES
rom
SI
A matter of interest to tb0 people
of this alle) u tuund in the blale
mt.ni. of tliu promuters of the new
i ail way lm0 that work has been ro
cumed on the sail Diego & Arizona
lailrodd. It will be remembered that
when the road was turned, it was
tne general idea that the road, wiieu
completed to Yuma, would connect
with the El I'abO & Southwestern,
which bad then been completed to
idcbcn and had made surveys by way
of Mesa, Phoenix and the Buckeyo
v alley to Yuma. For some reason the
work was suspended ou the San Diego
mil of the proposition and loo E. I.
i. S. W. stopped work at Tucson.
One of the regions given was the ad
verbu railway legislation enacted by
the law making body oIArliona.
From san Dii;o, the road has been
loinpiiicu as tar as Mampo, a moun
tain vlliagQ Cd xullis distant from
oan Dii-bO. lhat is a. very difficult
en am for railroad building. To a

i'here is another section of the road
completed from El Centra west to tho
mountains, a distance of 33 miles,
mountains, a distance of 33 miles,
lion of 22 miles and a new survey is
to be made for the remaining dis
tance.Al present trains are run dally
to Campo. from which place auto
stages carry the traveler to El Cen
tre. The SanDiegans have already fig
ured that 100,000 carloads of freight
9ram, cattle and metal, principally
will be transported over this road an
nually. The Vail Interests not the
Tucson Vails have a plan to trans
port cattle in large numbers to Santa
Uosa Island, off the coast, where they
will be fattened on the native moss.
Cattle for this purpose will be pur
chased in Mexico and crosed at Ca
lexico. The resumption of work on this
road, and the fact that the right of
way for the Clarkdale-Mesa road is
now being surveyed, leads to the be
lief that the E. P. &. 3. W. will Boon
eitenil its line to this valley and
connect with the latter road, presum
ably establishing a connection later
w 1th the Spreckles road at Yuma thus
opening up a very large and exceed
ingly rich section of country and giv
ing a through line to the coast.
REV. AHDSEN TAKEN

The many Tombstone friends of
Rev. Amundsen, pastor of the local
Congregational church will bo sorry
to hear that he is seriously ill and
was removed to tho Bisbee hospital
for treatment. Mr. Amundsen has
been ailing for some time and a turn
for the worse yesterday made it nec
essary for his removal to the hospital
Word today is that hla condition Is
not much improved.
