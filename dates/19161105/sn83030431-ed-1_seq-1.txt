DR. DVMBA RETIRED
AT HIS OWN REQVEST
Washington Regards Action ns
Indicating New Austrian
Envoy to V. S.
Vienna, via London, Nov. 4. Dr.
Theodor Konstantln Dumba, former Aus
trian Ambassador to the United State,
at his own request has been retired
from the diplomatic service by the Em
peror. The announcement of the retire
ment of Dr. Dumba Includes imperial
recognition of Dr. Dumba's excellent
services coverlng'a long period of years.
Washington, Nov. 4. Acceptance of
the resignation of Dr. Konstantln Dumba
as Ambsesador to the United States was
taken by State Department officials to-
night as a plain Indication that the Aus
trian Government Is about to name a
new diplomatic representative to Wash
ington.
Dr. Dumba returned to Austria after
he was declared to be persona non grata
by the United States Government more
than a year ago and the fnct that Aus-
rla lias not sooner accented his rrslini-
tlou from a post In which he could not
serve was looked upon as showing that
Emperor Francis Joseph desired to ex
press displeasure with the United States
in this fashion.
Sufficient time having elapsed since
his recall to make this displeasure clear
to the world, the ornclal view Is that
Austria Is now ready to send another
Ambassador to this country", for more
than a year the Embassy here has been
In charge of subordinate officials, and
Austria has been the only one of the
more Important European belligerents
not represented by a diplomat of higher
rank.
In the summer of 1915 Dr. Dumba
made himself unacceptable to the United
States Government whan lie attempted
to transmit through James F. J. Archi
bald, an Amerlean newspaper correspon
dent, a report to the Austro.Hungurlan
Foreign Office which disclosed the Am
bassador's participation In plans to crip
ple American munition plants by strikes.
British agents round the proof on Archi
bald when he arrived nt Falmouth.
The Washington Government cancelled
Archibald's passports and demanded the
recall of the Austrian representative. A
proposal that Dr. Dumba quit the United
States on leave of absence was not con
sidered satisfactory, and President Wil
son insisted on his recall. Dr. Dumba
left the United States on October 5 for
Vienna by way of Rotterdam.
BATTLE WITH GREEK

Outaide Ktrina.
London. Nov. C (Sunday). The Clreek
army arrived outside Katerlna and an
encasement with the vcnlzeltsts negan
to-night, says a despatch to the Sunday
Obicrver from Athens aatea Tiaay.
Londom. Nov. 4. Vlce-Admlral Du
Pournet. commander of the Entente fleet
n the Mediterranean, nas aemanaeu inai
tha Greek Government consent to the
use of a light flotilla carrying the Frencn
flag and French crew as a protection
against submarines, says a neuter des
patch from Athens. The Creek Cabinet
held a meeting to-day under me presi
dency of King Constantlne, the despatch
adds, and decided that the Vlcc-Ad-
mlral's demand was inacceptable be
cause consent to it would be equivalent
to a departure from neutrality.
The Greek Government has sent reen
forcements from Larlssa to the garrison
from Katerlna which recently evacuated
that place before the advance or Insur
gent forces. The regular army has or
ders to summon the insurgents to evacu
nte Katerlna under penalty of attack by
the Government forces.
In diplomatic circles there Is ssld to
be confidence that a satisfactory solu
tion of the difficulty will be reached and
bloodshed avoided.
The withdrawal of Greek troops from
Thessaly has been postponed, the des
patch states, pending the establishment
of what will virtually be a neutral zone.

TEUTONIC POWERS
WILL FREE POLAND
Governor-General von Header
of Warsaw to Issue Procla
mation To-day.
INDEPENDENT "KINGDOM"
Entente Governments at Odds
as to Who Shall lie the
New liuler.
AilsTxnDAM, Nov. 4 (via London, Nov,
6). According to a Ilerlln despatch re
ceived here. Gen. von Deseler, Governor
General of Warsaw, will Issue a procla
mation to-morrow, saying that the Ger
man and Austrian Emperors have agreed
to establish an Independent Ktate of Po
land with a hereditary monarchy and a
Constitution. A precise definite con
cernlng the frontiers of Poland Is re
served.
The proclamation will say that the
glorious traditions of the Polish armies
In the present and former wars will be
perpetuated In the national army, whose
organisation and training will bo regu
lated by mutual agreement.
"The great western neighbors of the
Kingdom of Poland," the proclamation
will conclude, "will nee with pleasure at
their eastern frontiers a free and happy
State which rejoices in Its national life
rearlse and flourish.
The proclamation will be published by
the Austro-llungarlan Governor-General
at Lublin.
Hope to llrerult Army of Poles.
The proclamation of an autonomous
Poland by the Central Powers has been
forecast recently In many uespalcnes,
In the Entcnto capitals this action lias
been regarded as an excuse to recruit
an army of Poles to fight the battles of
Germany and Austria.
It was reported that In August Ger
man and Austrian diplomats agreed that
Poland was to have her own constltut.on
under certain guarantees. These des
patches said the Poles would be called
upon to form an army for "national de
fence." A step In that direction was
taken about tho same time, when the
Austrian Foreign Office ordered that In
habitants of the part of Russtan Poland
occupied by Austrian troops be regarded
as "citizens of Poland," not as "Russian
subjects."
The question of who should be placed
upon the throne of the new kingdom of
Poland Is said to have caused disagree
ment between Berlin and Vienna.
Plan to Fight Raawlaas.
The Kaiser. It is said, wants a Ger
man Prince as the King, and Francis
Joseph wants to proclaim himself King,
Either would order a general mobilisa
tion to defend the Independence of the
country, that Is, to fight the Russians.
Lata In August a despatch from Petro
grad Mtd that'the-Russian Government
would soon make a definite announce
ment of Its policy In the future toward
Poland, "thus anticipating tho expected
proclamation of Polish autonomy by
Germany and Austria-Hungary."
Poon nfte rthe war commenced. In Au
gust, 1914, n Russian imperial manifesto
was Issued promising Poland autonomy
after the war If the Poles remained loyal
to Russia. Ixist May Sergltis Hasonoff,
then Premier of Russia, said that Po
land s autonomy under Russlnn suz
erainty was sure. Since then the more
reactionary M. Pturmer haB become Pre
mler of Russia.

NEW U. S. INQUIRY
OF GAR SHORTAGE
Interstate Commission to Ex
tend McChord Hearing to
Entire Country.
SHTATION NOW MENACE
Railroads Suggest Increased
Demurrage Charges and
Calling of Conferences.
Washinotov, Nov. 4. The nation
wide shortage of freight cars, tho most
acute for years, will be the subject of
a general Investigation covering every
part of tho United States. The Inter
state Commerce Commission announced
to-day that the Investigation would go
It to questions of supply, exchange and
return of freight cars, "with the view of
Isiulng such orders as the commission
tm.y deem appropriate."
A copy of the order was served on
representatives of all Interstate carriers,
and the first hearing was fixed for next
Wednesday at Louisville before Commis
sioner McChord, who 5s already there
conducting an Informal conference on
car shortage.
The action in extending the informal
conference at Louisville Into a sweeping
general investigation of a formal char
acter, with hearings probable In such
shipping centres as New York, Chicago,
Omaha, fit. Louis, Kansae City and
others, Is the result of complaints tiled
with the commission from all sections
recording serious conditions as the re
sult of the cer famine. Traffic commit
tees msy be organized to cope with the
situation, as was done last spring.
geek to Increase Demurrage.
The railroads already have taken one
step to help themselves In tneir ill-
lemma by filing tariffs Increasing !
murrage charges on cars either loading i
or unloading. They want thi" Increase rf-
fectlve December 1. but shippers, an In
the paBt. have protested nRalnst It and
may force either suspension or cancellu-
tlmi of the demurrace tariffs.
The car shortage Is mostly felt In the
middle West coal fields and nt ports
where export shipping facilities are In
adequate, but the shortage Is felt In
some degree In every State. The rail
roads contend that the commission has
not been sufficiently liberal In allowance
of re.'.es to permit them to spend much
money In new equipment. Shippers say
the roads for approximately three years
past have been generally lax In ordering
new cars.
An effort will be made to learn how
much additional equipment would be re
quired on each road to handle all traf
flo offered; whether shippers are being
discriminated against In car distribu
tion; whether thy are, really coofyrut
Inr with the fbaas'torrte the situs-
tlon : how many cars have been dls
carded recently and how many new ones i
have been ordered and wh
men neiivory isi
to be expected.
Mar Call Conterener to Help.
Louisville, Nov. 4. Proposals that

Commerce Commission call a conference', ,. ' ,,
of the executive heads of the railroad ""iv" !.'0'
conferences of the Kast. South and West j."" L ,,,.'.
were communlcatd by railroad repre-
sentatlves late to-day to Commissioner
C. C. McChord, w o has been presiding
over the Informal Inquiry held here.
Tho communication declares It tho
sense of the railroad representatives that
"the Immediate nctlon desired by you In
the present situation can be best ob-
tallied by a request upon Messrs. A. if.
Smith, Fairfax Harrison and It. II.
Alshton, chairmen of tho conferences of
the Kast, the Houth and tho West re
spectively, to meet you upon such date
as you may flx, together with such of the
members of their conferences as they
may designate. In order that a commit
tee with power may bo constituted to
cenfer with the commission."
C. H. Phelps, superintendent of trans
portation nf the Louisville nnd Nashville
itallroail, was tna principal wltnesx to-
day before Commissioner McChord.
Itoads, ho said, which give to other lines
more trnftlc than they receive must liavu
returned to them from foreign carriers
many empty cars It the car supply bal
ance Is to be maintained. All Northern
and Kastern connection, nf the Louis
ville nnd Nashville, he ald, had failed
to return empty cars and had used them
in their own trnfllc.
He recommended that the Interstate
Commerce Commission assume direction
of the enforcement of car service rules,
that demurrage charges be put on a
progressive basis and that the per diem
charges against carriers holding a for
eign car be Increased.

Already il.ign were fluttering like red

was a pounding of feet, terrific Jarring,
