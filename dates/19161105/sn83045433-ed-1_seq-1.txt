Wrilson Says Criticism Has En
dangered Nation's Safety.
4By the Istervatienal News Service.)
Shadow lawn. N. J., Nov. 4.-PresIdent
Wilson in his closing speech of the cam
paign here this afternoon said there was I
a tine when .the Republicans controlled
the credit of the country, but that now
they only controlled the betting. The
only reply to the criticism of his foreig.
policies was this:
"It seems to me that men calling them
selves statesmen would spread tinder In
this country when spIrks without number
are blowing over from the terrible con
flagration abroad. They have sought to
make party capital out of things which if
not settled wiseg might bring this coun
try into the world confiet which is
devastating Europe."
Mr. Wilson made a direct appeal for
votes with the argument that the coun
try yan never before so prosperous. He
said:
"With this outlook is it worth while to
stop and think of party advantage? Is
It worth while stopping to think how we
have voted in the past'"
In beginning Mr. Wilson delivered a
broadside against the campaign of the
Republicans on the State ticket In New
Jersey. He declared they were endeavor
ing to re-establish Invisible government
In the State, adding:
"And after all. the thing that is being
attempted in New Jersey Is only a part
of what is being nitempted In the United
States with even more transparency of
purpose.
Gov. Fielder introduced Mr. Wilson as
"Ihe man of the honr.
The President wild In part:
lilt. Proterilve Tariff.
-e have heard a great deal of talk
condeination of invisible government.
Invisible government never existed in
more lateful forms tnan it has existed in
Iast years in this State of New Jersey.
and that invisible government never had
Inore suc'essful places of concealment
than it had in such localities as Atlantic
('it,. front which the candidate for gov
ernor on the Republiean side has been
'ho-en. and it never received more suc
;essful and persistent defense than it
has received from the newspapers which
he owns and controls.
"After searching in vain for an issue
the Republicans came down once more to
the only thing they have in recent years
ever in"wn how to talk about, and that
u as the protective tariff.
They know perfectly well that all the
pretenses about the protective tariff have
been torn away not by the oratory of
Dbemocratic speakers. but by he patent
demonstration of fact.
"They know that the working men of
this country may have been deceived for
a litt# while, but theyeannot be de
ceived all the time. They know just as
'well as we know that the industries In
which the highest protective was given
protected the lowest wages and they
know that the highest wages were pro
lec ted in the least protected industries.
That is a matter of record."

GET U-BOAT DATA
U. S. Officials Receive Rowan
more and Marina Facts.
The State Department has received by
cable from the American Embassy in
London summaries of the affdavits made
by American survivors of tLe British
steamers Rowanmore and Marina.
From the information at hand it is be
lieved that there no longer is any poes
bility of a serious controversy over the
Rowanmore. That vessel admittedly at
tempted to escape when It was sunk.
It Is thought that the case of the Marina
in whose destruction. supposedly by a
German submarine, six Americans lost
their lives, will center in the determina
tion of the character of armed vessels.
Before that question shall arise. however,
the State Department must await the ar
rival by mail of the afidavits which alone
constitute appiceahle evidence. It has not
yet been established beyond doubt wheth
er the Marina was sunk by a submarine
or a mine.
As concerns the position this govern
ment will take In case it is established
that the Marina was torpedoed. there is
much doubt. The United States had up
held the right of belligerent merchant
vessels to carry defensive armament, but
all nations do not accept the American
doctrine as regards neutral obligations re
lating to such ships.
No nation during the present war has
defended more resolutely neutral rights
and championed more heartily the law of
nations that Holland. insisting upon re
spect for her rights in regard to inter
ferences with the mails where the United
States made concessions.
Holland refuses to permit armed mer

that she is "obliged to place such vesela
