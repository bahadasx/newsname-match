THE REPUBLICAN STATEMENT,
By Chairman Willcox.
THE result of next Tuesday's election Is not In
doubt, nor jt is a matter of uncertainty. It is
not a question of rival claims.
This fight has won for the ticket of tho reunited
Republican party.
After recelvlnp; reports from moat of tho States
throughout tho country, it is the, unanimous belief
of the members o'f the national campaign commit
tco that Mr. Hughes will havo at least 100 majority
in tho Electoral Collego and doubtless this majority
will be very much larger. I have made this report
to Mr. Hughes, as it is based on reports received
from all over tho country.
Thcso extravagant claims aro the invariable
accompaniment of tho Democrat in Presidential
campaigns. Our opponents havo always elected
their candidates by a large majority in tho days
immediately preceding the election, but (they fail on
election day, and they will lamentably fail on
Tuesday next. 4
THE DEMOCRATIC STATEMENT,
By Chairman McCormick.
WOODROW WILSON will bo re-elected Presi
dent Tuesday by a popular plurality and a
majority in tho Electoral Collego.
Tho votes of Democrats. Progressives, Inde
pendents, and Republicans in countless thousands
will contribute to tho approval of the President
and his policies.
These some elements will combine to elect a
sympathetic Senate and House of Representatives,
to co-operate with tho President in the extension
and perpetuation of his policies, foreign and do
mestic. .
President Wilson will have not fewer than 864
votes in the Electoral College, with the probability
that this number may bo increased to 41G, and the
possibility that it may be swelled to 461.

i'n6'- I have made this report to
Mr, Hughes this afternoon, as it
In , 5. .un rePor.t8 received from
all over the country.
So far as the claims of oar oppo

not improper to call attention to
the fact that when Mr. McCormick

they have the best chance now even

while even money was bet that he will

made that Hughes wilt carry New

dismissed as nbHurd by members of
