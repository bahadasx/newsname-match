Reoubllcan A. P. Leased Wire
NKW YORK, Nov. 4.- Charles K.
Hughes dosed his campaign for Hie,
presidency in this city tonight with a
big meeting at Madison Square Garden.
The speech he delivered was his fifth of
the day and followed four in the open
air in different parts of the city durin
the afternoon.
Before the night meeting Mr.
Hughes rode at the head of a great
torchlight procession called a ' Wheel
of Flame," the nine "spokes'" of which
converged upon Fifth Avenue. Many
thousands of men, each carrying a
flaming torch were in line as the pro
cessions came together, one after an
other. So long was the parade lhat it
was split into two sections, one of
which marched tip Fifth Avenue and
the other up Madison Avenue to th"
Harden. ;
The broad avenues were filled with
long ribbons of light, as the republican
cohorts moved onward. Interspersed at
frequent intervals were hands which
played martial and ttriotic airs. The
car in which the candidate rode was
the only automobile in line.
Much excitement was caused by an
I explosion in North Street only a few
j feet from Mr. Hughes as he sat in his
.iiiiuiiioinie waning ior one or the di
visions of the jiarade to start. It was
believed at first that a bomb had been
hurled at the nominee, but Inspector
F.gan of the Rureau of Combustibles
declared a photographer's flash light
powder caused the explosion. The only
persons injured, the police say. were
two newspaper men .who were hiisKtlv
hurt.
With Mr. Hughes in his car were A.
R. Hepburn and two detectives. The
nominee did not seem perturbed by the
incident and smilingly acknowledged
the plaudits of the crowds through
which he passed as the jiaraders moved
on, fourteen abreast.
A drizzling rain, which began falling
just as the parade began damened
somewhat the ardor of the demonstra
tion which greeted the republican can
didate but cheering crowds lined Fifth
Avenue from the time he passed under
the Iiewey Arch in Washington square.
Madison Square Garden was com
fortably filled by seven o'clock and ev
ery seat was taken, when the blare of
bands heralded the candidate s coming.
Mrs. Hughes accompanied by her
three daughters, Helen, Catherine and

of .th.e city of New York, speaking i f a
"Pfunited republican party, referred t
that "wonderful American" Theodore
Roosevelt. The demonstration i 'ted
several minutes when Mr. Hughes en
tered the hall. The crowd settled down
after thirty-five minutes to a steady
rythm of "Hughes. Hughes. Hughes."
The cheering had been going on twenty-six
minutes when Mrs. Hughes was
escorted to the balcony beside her hus
band. At this the audience redoubled
its noise. Charles K. Hughes. Jr.. and
his wife followed, then the nominees

family was grouped around him. A
mammoth flag was unfurled from the
i ceiling, the band played the "Star

ceased cheering to sine The demon
stration had lasted forty minutes.
"My voice is worn but my heart is
stout and my confidence is complete
that we are marching to a triumphant
victory next Tuesday," began Mr.
Hughes. He said he desired to express

"God's in His heaven, the cause is

amid loud applause.
