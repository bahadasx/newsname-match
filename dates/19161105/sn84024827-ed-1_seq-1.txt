PHOENIX, Nov, 4. Congressman
Carl Hayden today sent the following
self explanatory signed communica
tion to Chairman Stoneman of the
Democratic state central committee:
"My attention has been directed to

appeared in the Aritona Republican
on November 1. Permit me to advise
you that I knew absolutely nothing

Score of Bands Join
The ftroad avenues were filled with
Jong ribbons of light in which the Re
publican cohorts moved onward. In
terspersed at frequent Intervals were
bands which played martial and patri
otic airs. The car in which the can
didate rode, was the only automobile
in the line.
Much excitement was caused by an
explosion in Forty Fourth Street on
ly a few feet from Mr. Hughes as he
sat in his automobile waiting for one
of the divisions of the parade to start.
It was believed at first that bomb had
been hurled at the nominee, but In
spector Egan of the bureau of com
bustibles, declared a photographer's
flashlight powder caused the explo
sion. The only persons injured, the
police said, were two newspaper men
who were slightly hurt.
With Mr. Hughes In his car were
A. B. Hepburn and two detectives.
The nominee did not seem perturbed
by the incident and smilingly acknow
ledged the plaudits of the crowds
through which he passed as the par
aders moved on, fourteen abreast.
Rain Rains in Vain
A drizzling rain which began fall
ing just as the parade started damp
ened somewhat the ardor of the dem
onstration which greeted the Repub
lican candidate but cheering crowds
lined Fifth Avenue from the time he
passed under the Dewey Arch in
Washington Square.
Madison Square was comfortably
filled by seven o'clock and every seat
was taken when the blare of bands
heralded the candidates coming.
Mrs. Hughes, accompanied by her
three daughters, Helen. Catherine and
Elizabeth, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E.
Huehes. Jr., occupied a box.
William A. Prendergast, comptrol
ler of the city of New York, speaking
of a reunited Republican party here
referred to the "wonderful American
Theodore Roosevelt." The demon
stration lasted several minutes when
Mr. Hughes entered the hall. The
crowd settled down after 35 minutes
to a steady rythm of "Hughes. Hughes
Hughes." The cheering had been go
ing 35 minutes when Mrs. Hughes
was escorted to the balcony by the
side of her second son.
A mamoth flag was unfurled from
the ceiling, the band played the Star
Spangled Banner, and the audience
ceased cheering to sing.
The demonstration had lasted forty
minutes .
"My voice is worn but my heart Is

Hughes. "I believe that the Ameri

business could be considered "reck

in reply to the temporary injunctions

against the Ford Company last Thurs

using its assets to develop its busi
ness along lines recently announced

Shadow Lawn for Speech.
(By Review Leased Wir:
LONG BRANCH. N. J.. Nov. 4.
President Wilson closed his campaign
for re-election at Shadow Lawn today
with a speech in which he accused,
the opposition of attemuting to coerce
workingmen and charged that political
capital is being made out of unset
tled questions "which if not settled
wisely might bring this country at any
time into the world conflict"
Predicting Democratic victory next
Tuesday, the President declared:
"Having despaired of an issue they
are filling the country with alarms.
They are not only filling the country
with alarms, but they are attempting
coercion of laborers. They imagine
that the men are not their own mas
ters and dare not vote as they think,
but at last. I thank God, the American
laborer is awake.
President Confident.
"Let them fill the country with
alarms: the alarms are their own. not
our. They used to control the credit
of the country; now they control no
thing but the betting. So, my fellow
citizens." he continued. "I feel rising
in my pulse already the inspiration
and impulse which is to come not only
to the Inited States but the whole
World next Tuesday. I do not identify
myself with this. To me has fallen
the unspeakable good fortune of hap
pening to be the spokesman of the
American people at this critical and
fateful tin?."
The Tariff Bugaboo.
Mr. Wilson asserted that the Re
publican party had fallen back on the
protective tariff as its only issue.
"They know perfectly well." he
said, "that all the pretenses about the
protective tariff have been ftrn away."
adding that the industries with the
highest protection have paid the low
est wages.
Difference in Parties.
"The difference between the Repub
lican party and the Democratic party
is this." he continued. "The Republi
can party offers them masters; we
offer them comrades and leaders. The
Republican party offers to take care
of them; we offer to go into a flsht
shoulder to sl.oulder with them to get
the rights which no man has a right
to give them."
Enormous Crowd There.
The President's address was deliver
ed before a large gathering which
came from Jersey City. Newark. Tren
ton. Princeton and other towns and
cities in the state, including a delega
tion of Princeton professors and stu
dents. Ctn-ernor Fielder of New Jer
sey presided.
The President said in part:
"invisible government never existed
in more hateful form than it has ex
isted n past years n this state of New
Jersey.
"When I see this unblushing, thit
impudent attempt to reinstate these
forces without any Concealment of any
kind, do you wonder that I would like
to get out again and denounce th-
whole crowd as I know them? Because
the purpose is to do exactly with the
