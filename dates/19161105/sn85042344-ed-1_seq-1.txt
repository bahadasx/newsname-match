prevent the Democratic party from a

In the I'nited States. If the Demo

the Democratic party is responsible
for the war In Kurope. If it claiiiu

the hour produced ty the most ap

escaping the responsibility for that
devastating disaster which threatens

OWN RECORD FOUL
WITH DEEP CRIMES
Was Indicted for Introduc
ing Liquor; Bully and
Bad "Gun Man."
JAMKS S. DAVENPORT has seen
fit to take a vicious, unwarranted
personnl attack on the editor of The
World, in which the congressional
nominee attempted to cast a shadow
on the personal affairs of the editor.
The editor of Tho World is not a
candidate; and bo far as he knows,
there has been no enmity of a per
sonal nature heretofore existing be
tween the two men. Davenport's at
tacks on the editor are for no other
reason than that The World is a Ke
p ii til I ca II newspaper, doing Its duty to
the Republican party, ami supporting
tho Republican candidate, T. A.
Chandler.
Tho World In Its uterances has been
fair and honorable.
Stories by the scoi have reached
the editor's desk claiming that Haven
port was guilty of every crime in tne
calendar, from being Indicted for in
troducing liquor to that of murder.
The World for the past six you is
has refused to print these reports on
Davenport; but Inasmuch as ho has
seen fit to bring the name of the
editor of The World Into his dirty
campaign, we propose to show the
proof we have of the character of
the man who is now asking again tho
suffrage of the decent, honer.c, hon
orable and law-abiding citizens of
the Klrst congressional district.
The fact that he did kill a man, an
unarmed woodchonpor, in the pres
ence of his little daughter, was tried
and sentenced to seven years in the
penitentiary on June 29, 185, is loo
well known to go further Into dctuils.
That he always has been an asso
ciate, defender and protector of the
criminal element, especially the boot
legger, is proved by 18 citations In the
1'aolflc Reporter, nnd the fact that
he absented himself from congress to
defend bootleggers whom his .ow'i
correspondence shows he knew them
to be guilty, Is also proved. Not only
did he neglect his duties as a con
gressman to defend them, but he
wrote them to have a witness perjure
himself. Ilu defended criminals he
knew to be guilty, and by his own act
attempted to make others criminals by
perjuring themselves.
The proof of this is in the follow
ing letter:

college in tho season's classic yester
day afternoon at Association field
In spite of itself.
Those orange uml black, '.''i d gladia
tors which comprise tho mjchlno of
the institution of burning on Tulsa's
eastern border emerged from Ihe an
nual clash exhausted, battered beyond
any specific shape and not a little
ushamed of themselves but bearing
nevertheless on their padded shoul
ders that long-droainod-.if trcphy. The
final soore whs 17 to 13, which dot-3
not j resent ill any d 'gree the re
spir!ie strength of the twj aggrega
tions. It was a madcap game. A night
mare of fumbles, Jagged defenses and
hapbuzurd offensives. No two teams
ev r met on a wlutc-chalked gridiron
who so ultcrly and comp'otely did not
live up to exptet itions as the con

Kendall Willi Wild.
Kendall, touted as a scintillating,
meteoric bench of speed and nerve,
wont harum-scarum from the first
whistle, while the Aggle3 compact and
so'ld. played stolidly, oold-hcurtedlv
and lumberingly but without the fire
to stay their opponents.
There was little seiu'ilance of me
chanical perfection manifest through
out the fray. Kendall's baokfield
tried to go around left end and
couldn't. Kelidnll't bncufied tried to
go through the lino and couldn't. Then
Kendall resorted to Its only pi her of
fensive, nerlal warfare and wen.
Vbtorv came to the local vhlele
at the last heartbreaking lap. With
hut three more minutes In which to
play, with nlsrht gathering and ohsoiir.
!ng for the t-pootiitors field and play
ers, and with the score 13 to 10 In
fnv'r.r of the visitors, Kendall executed
a foiward pass, which amocnted to a
touchdown, and the game was won.
At the time the last touchdown was
made the ball was in Kotidi.ll's hands
on the Aggies' 30-vnrd line. The teams
lined up. the ball was snapped Into

It will be well for the oters o

So far as tho remainder of the Re
