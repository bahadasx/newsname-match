"n inJay morning nn tinidenti-
'icd thief entered the home of Mr,
mm. J. T. Sanford, No. 817
"eitli Third avenue, end rtole there-
,'iom diamonds and other Jewelry
.i.servuively valued ot $2,000. The
robbery took place while the house
was untenanted, both members of
JTe family and the servants having
vuiigrcgaiea in me ousincs3 dis
trict to watch the parade of the Con
federate Veterans, which then was in
progress. Tho thief climbed through
a cellar window, then forced open a
door to c stairway leading to the
main floor, and proceeded to ran
sack the house..
The articles known to be missing
'.rc v. diamond pin, a valuable dia
mond brooch, four rings and a pair
of tuff button. Other things may
also have been taken, as the burglar
sccmsjo have leisurely ransacked the
whole house, teking whatever he
chanced to fancy.
Other houses in the neighborhood
wero also visited, the burglar having
?one to the home of Mr. and Mrs. W.
.1. Harrington, who live just across
no street from tho Sanford home,
where lie told the servant who an
swered his ring that he was a tele
phone repair man, and asked for per
mission to examine. the phone. The
servant told him that the phone was
'a good shape, and declined to let
him in. After having been refused
admittance to the Harrington home
the marauder proceeded to a house
in another block which was former
ly occupied by the family or Mr.
Thomas Keith, but which is now un
tenanted. He evidently intended to
rob this house, but, finding it vacant,
proceeded on his way.
Servants who saw the thief de
scribe him as being a white man of
medium height, about 35 (rears old
and having light hair. He wore a
:i"at suit of dark clothes, while a
g-ay cap rested jauntily upon his
head.
It is generally understood that
Ilaraloff Chelzceski, who was found
hiding in the belfry of a negro church
on North Sixth avenue last Sunday,
anu wno was later identified as the
murderer of May Goodwin, the
wealthy demi-monde, had a pal here
with him, and many people believe
that he is the man who entered the
Sanford home. Ever since Chelz-.
ceski was arrested local police have
been looking for his pal, but have
not yet succeeded in locating him.
Mr. Sanford has offered a reward
of ,$100 for the recovery of the iew.
elry and an additional reward of $50
tor the arrest of the thief or for in
formation which will lead to his an-
prehension.

van found hiding In the belfry of a
n.gro church in North Columbm lat
Sunday, and who was Inter identi
fied as the murderer of May Good-
win, queen "of the Memphis un ler
uorld, arrived in the Bluff City last
Wednesday night, after having made
an ineffectual attempt to escape from
Al Ilurtt, the detective who had him
in charge.
Notwithstanding the fact that
( helzceskl has been positively iden
tified as tho slayer of the Goodwin
woman he still persists in declaring
that he is innocent of the crime.
Chelzceski attempted to make his
getaway by throwing snuff in Hurst's !
eyes while the pair wero walking
from one depot to another in W
nona Wednesday afternooon, but
this effort failed to succeed on ac
count of the fact that the detective
wore glasses, which protected his
eyes and prevented the snuff from
getting into them. His vision was
only slightly impaired and he drew
out his revolver and fired threo shots.
While none of the bullets hit Chel
zceski, they scared him so badly that
he surrendered to Hurst, and was
quite docile throughout the remain
der of the trip.
On his arrival in Memphis Chel.
ceski gave a representative of the
News-Scimitar the following story of
his career, ivhich will prove interest
ing to readers of the Commercial, as
it includes several of his escapades in
Columbus:
Chelzceski was clad only in his
shirt, his underwear and his sock.,
the rest of his clothes having been
taken away by the police. Under
his right eye was a livid scar, his left
thumb was off and there was a ring
tatooed on the third finger of his
hand. He readily explained how he
obtained tho scar.
"I served in the British army in
the South African war against the
Rocrs in 1901," he said, "and tlii
I scar was caused by a saber cut. I
lost my thumb a year ago while ho
boing when it was mashed off be
tween the bumpers on two cars. I
had the tattoo work done while in
Cape Town with the army.
"I left my home in Poland in 18DP,
after having been educated in a Rus
sian school, and went to Kngland.
After the war I returned there, and
18 months ago I came to America,
working my way on the Cardiff, a
tramp steamer, to Tampa, Fla. The
only time I was ever arrested wa3 in
Baltimore when they grabbed me for
being drunk.
"I have hoboed around, working a
a day laborer anywhere I could find
a job. I blew into Columbus on a
rattler last Saturday night. I was

hungry and I searched around for
something to eat. I found a refrig-j's
cuter on somebody's back porch,
opened it, ate all I could and put the
rest in my pockets. It was chilly and
I wanted something to cover me, so
I twisted the padlock off a man's
garage, stole a laprobc and started
out to find n place to flop for the
niht. I picked out a negro church
as a place where I was not likely to
be disturbed.
"At 5 o'clock Sunday afternoon I
awoke. The negroes were holding
services downstairs, and one climbed
up Into the'belfry to see what caused
the noise up there. He took one look
at me and beat it. I came down and
tried to get away but the cops caught
me."
Reward Increased.
Governor Theo. G. Bilbo ha3 in
formed Mr. II. J. Dashiell that he
would increase the statutory reward
to $300 for the arrest or for any
information that will lead to tha Ar
