Balfour Assailed for
Submarine Successes
andChannel Raid
EXPERTS FEAR
SHIPPING CRISIS
Commons to Hear Demand
for Immediate Check of
German Campaign
By ARTni'R S. DRAPER
I flMfl Ifl Th' Trtlune.]
London, Nov. 4.--British reportg on
the German Channel raid and the havoc
wrought on shipping by the new sub?
marine campaign have exciteij a tre
mendous amount of d:??atisfaction in
and out of Parliament. S;r Henry Dal
ziel has asked frr a special time in
? ? HOBse of Commons for discussion
nf the British Admiralty administra?
tion.
Attacks on Arthur Balfour, First
I.ord of the Admiralty, appear in sev?
eral of to-day's publications. "The Na?
tion" contains an especially bitter crit
' icism, which says: "No incident of the
war could be more wounding to the na?
tional pnde, even though others may
have been judged to touch more inri
rnately tho issues of war and the fort
unes of the power on which they hang.
Hut, there are graver considerations
! than those of injured pride.
Stop I'-Boats, I* Demand
"Now that the long-hidden results of
the secoiid German submarine cam
paign are being revealed the country
. asks why the Admiralty has failed to
1 repeat Lord Fisher's brilllant repulse
' of the first campaigr.. Why, indeed?
The navy is practically on the defen
-iv*. Vet the primary purpose of da
f.-nee is unfulfilled.
"No one b'ames our sailors and their
j able and accomplished Admiral in
' Chief. They are magnificent. But did
any one knowing Balfour's character,
I intellect, temperament and methods of
? work imagine for a moment that he
I was the man to play the part of direc
: tor to a machine that wants, above
I everything ilse, prompt, ingenious,
i praetieal and forethinking intelli
genee?"
The marine insurance correspondent
of "The Telegraph," commenting on
the submarino campaign, says: "The
riays do not Improve as they pass by,
each one bringing a tale of won too
serious to be contemplated without *
certain amount of anxlety." He says
it is to be feBred that "two fine British
steamers have been nunk, but the news
is uot yet off'cially rontirmed."
Submarine* Work Havoc
The naval writer of "The National
Review" emphasizes the seriousness of
the ehipping situation and the neces?
sity of prompt auppression of tha U
boats. whirh are woiking havoc among
Allied and neutral *hips.
Another question coming up for dis
CBSSiea ifl Parliament this week is man
power. The cost of living is con
lUBtly increasing and fast reaching :?
pg nl where it ls becoming a seriou.-.
burden. I'nder these conditions thero
il bound to be a lively discussion ot
every move to comb the country- t?l
men at the expense of industry and

GREEK TROOPS

Struggle for Katerina Be?
gins ? Cabinet Rejects
New Allied Demand
London, Nov. 5.- "The Greek arnv:
arrived outsido Katerina and an en
gagoment with the Veniielists begnn
to-night," says a dispatch to "The Sun
day Observer" from Athens, dated Kri
dav.
Vice-Admiral du Fournet, commander
of the Fntente fleet in the Mediter
ranean, has demanded that the Greek
government consent to the use of a
Greek light flotilla carrying the Freneh
flag ar.d Freneh crews as a protection
Bgatast submarines, says a Rcuter dis?
patch from Athens.
The Greek Cabinet held a meeting
to-day under the prtsldaaey of King
Constantine, the dispatch add*, and de
; cided that the vice-admiral's demand
? was inacceptable because consent to it
would be equivalent to a departure
i from neutrality.
King Constantine had sent reinforce
ments from Larissa to the garrison
from Katerina, which was evacuated
: before the rebel advance. This force
had orders to demand that the insua
gents nurrender the town or faco an

They marcheil last night for;
Hughes.
Four frtrong plialanxes, tnoving
under the quivering red aurora of
; ireh tires, which played weinily on
the floats, the hanners and the faces
of the marchers, surged into Madi
son Square at 8 o'clock from the four
quarters cf thc compass. Thence
the quadruple pageant? a mighty
living symbol 6.">,000 strong?swung
up the rain-wet asphalt of Fifth
Avenue, between solid ranks of ac
rlaiming thousands, past the review
ing stand at Thirty-ninth Street and
under the eyes of their leader?.
Charles E. Hughes.
Mr. Hughes led the first division
from Madison Square as far as the
Union League Club, where he took
: his place in the stand at 7:35 o'clock.
! For two hours before the candidate
began his address at Madison Square
Garden the marching columns
Ftepped by. For an hour after Mr.
[ Hughes had uttered his concluding
sentence and the applauding throngs
at the Garden had gone their ways,
the sound of marching feet filled the
i avenue.
lt was ended on the stroke of 12.
: when the last seetions reached Fifty
; r.inth Street, where the procession
aisbanded.
Spirit of Cmaaders
It waa America's greatest parade on
hehalf of a candidate for office, with
the possible exception of the Sound
Mor.ey parade for McKinley, which
passed along the name avenue in IIM,
f greater than the Free Silver parade
; for Bryan in Chicago the same year;
! greater in numbers, in spirit, in dis
' play. in gignincance. It was essentially
| non-partisan and non-political. It was
i more than a parade. It was a crusade,
| for the spirit of crusaders was in it.
Mr. Hughes joined one of the feeder
| columns at Worth Street and Broadway
and rode at its head to the converging
: point at Madison Square, where he
i took the head of the first division. It
was a continuous and tumultuous ova
I tion for the candidate all along the
j line at the l'nion League Club.
His appearonce on the revlewing
! atand was greeted by deaiening ap
! plause. He stepped forward with A.
' Barton H-*pburn and Lawrence Green
his secretary. Former President Will?
iam H. Taft, who had mounted the
stand a few minutes before with for-;
mer Ser.ator Elihu Root and General
Horace Porter, was the first to greet
the candidate.
"Hello, Charlie, how are you?"
beamed the ex-President, grasping Mr. I
Hughcs's hand.
The candidate clasped the hands ofl
Kr. Hoot, Cicneral Porter ar.d Robert'
Bacon. and lifted his hat in acknowl-,
edgmflBt to the plaudlts of the m.arch
flia.

Mr. Taft caught sight of a regiment

clotii capes and bearing the oldtime
Bil lanp torches. He looked on with
a rflmialsCflBt imllfl, and ex-S**nator
Koot, too, with an expres*ion that
seemed ta say, "lt carries me back."
Mr. Haghfll watched the procession

pressed his contidence of

worde:
"It has been quite appa

American people were about

many states, and I have wit
nessed many extraordinary
demonstrations of the inter?
est in the issues of this cam?
paign.
"There has been a grow

national prestige and that the
rights of American citizens

WILSON CHARGES
LABOR COERCION
In Final Address Says
G. 0. P. Has Spread
False Alarms
tFrom a S'aff CotTMpor.ler.t nf Tha Trthsin*!
Long Branch, N. J., Nov. 4. -Pre.st
! dtnt Wilson wound up hia campaign
to-day at Shadow I.awn by address
ing his old neighbors from Prince?
ton, Trenton and other Jersey towns,
who had come to celebrate "Old
Home" Day.
Although nearly 20,000 persons had
been expected to demonstrate with
their enthusiasrn that New Jersey
would stand by the President. less
than 5,000 were in attendance. For the
tirst time also the skics did not smile
on the Snadow Lawn festivitles, and it
was under lowering clouds and in a
biting wind that the President epoke.
Mr. Wilson aocused the opposition
1 of attempting to coerce workingmen
and eharged that politieal capital is
being made out of unsettled questions
which, if not settled wisely, might
bring this country at any time into
the world conflict."
Predicting Democratic vietory next
Tuesday, the President declared:
"Having dexpaired of an issue, they
nre filling the country with alarms.
They are jiot only filling th* country
with alarms, but they ara attempting
coercion of their laborers. They im
ttgine that these men are not their
cwn masters, and dare not vote as
they think, but at laat, I thank God,
the American laborer is awake.
Says 0. O. P. ControU Bet ting
"Let them till the country with
alarms. The alarms are their own,
not ours. They used to control the
credit of the country; now they con?
trol nothing but the bettlng."
President Wilson again assailed the
Republicans for the "dishonesty" of
the issues they had raised, condemning
their leaders for dragging foreign poli?
cies into the fray.
He declared that the Republican
campaign had "become more and more
transparent," and that each week had
seen a "new issue raised" which was
"no sooner approached than it disap
peared and left nothing to grapj.le
with."
At la^t, the President said, the Re
publicans "had come down to the only
thing they knew how to talk about -
the protective tariff," but no longer
would the people consent to be de
ceived. he declared, by tho falsity of
that issue.
As in hu Buffalo speech. the Presi
dent aeain, oy lafeiBBee. eaadeeaaed
the Roosevelt criticism of hu foreign
policy. lie declared himself "amazed'
that "some of our opponents callmg
themselves "tatesmen are making party
xport out of things which, if they are
not settled wisely, might bring this
country into the Kuropean war."
Voter*' Opportunity
Voters of the United States, the
Pn - ler.t said, this year had an oppor?
tunity they never had before.
"It :s an unpreciiliTr.il tl :ng
world for a nation in foreign ..rTairs
1 to be unseltish. My ambition is to y'.
'? that example, not only morally. but in
: tellectually. I feel rising in my pulse
: already the inspiration that is to be
felt in the nation and the world next
! Tuesday. I do not take credit to mv
| ?elf. To me ha* fallen the unspeakably
i good fortur.e of happeiung to be the
i ?pokesman of the American people at
this time."
The President al*o spoke particularly
1 of the Democratic campaign Ifl Nc.v
I Jersey. and declared the fight to be
? the same as he had waged as ('igyernor
! six years ago against the forces of "in
visible" and '-baekfltairs" government
He condemned the Republican rand

Crowds in the Garden
Cheer Candidate for
40 Minutes
SEES VICTORY
FOR AMERICANISM
Declares That the People
Will Uphold Rights of
Citizenship
The swclling, surging checrs of
lo.OOO men and women in Madison
Square ?'arden last night sealed the
conliden.re of Charles E. Hughc.%
that h? will be elected President of
the United States next Tueaday.
For forty minutes the acclaim *b*b>
tinued.
Nothing short of exhiustion
seemed likely to stop t.he Garden
cheers, when Mr. Hughes stepped
into the great a.ssemblage for the
grand linale of the- Repui lican cam?
paign in state and nation. Some
body must have sensed his coming.
A voice in the gallery interrupted
Governor Whitman's speech to shout
"Three cheers for H.ighes!" just as
the crowd parted to admit Mr.
Hughes and his party.
Every man and woman in the
place stood up on chairs to catch a
glimpse while testing his or her
iunp gower in a mighty roar that for
forty minutes knew no let up. In a
jiffy Mr. Hughes was in his place
beside Governor Whitman, William
If. Calder, Chairman Willcox, Oscar
Straua, Controller William A. Prrn
dergast and other leaders. It vral
just a bedlam after that.
Greeted an Prenldent
It swelled of its own acmrd and
was still swelling when Mr. Pren
ilergast tried to stop it to introduce
Mr. Hughes.
"He who will now addres you." be?
gan Mr. Prendergast, i<>ntinuiiig
with diffkulty because of the mter
ruptions, "needs no introductioi,. The
nation knows him. I, however, shall
take the liberty of addressing him sj
the nation will addres him on March
4 next." Then, turning and howing
to Mr. Hughes, he said, "Mr. Presi?
dent," and the crowd went at it
anew.
"Our next President!" yclled a
galleryite, "Charles E. Hughes!"
When the din subsided, he called out
next: "Our next Secretary of State,
Theodore Roosevelt!" "It must b*
, Hughes!" yelled another.
"Who took the will out of Wilson?"
Mr. Hughes began. "Fellow citlzenfl.
my voice is somewhat worn, but my
heart is stout, and my confidence is
complete that wa are marching to ?
triumphant vietory next Tuesday. Tha
best of all welcomes is the welcome
home. When I tirst heard your greet
ing It seemed to sound like a conven
! tion, but after a while I thought it
sounded more like an election."
Predicta Vietory
Mr. Hughes then saeerted aia con
viction that he would be electe.i. When
he iaid that the Amencan people hav*
il'teriniiied that this nation shall re
gain its International prestlge, a roar
cf approval greete.l him.
Mr. Hughefl in his speech covered all
I the issues that he has made prominent
' ln the course of his campaixn, layin*
particular stress upon Americaniflm,
American rights, the tarifT, "war pro?
perity," the Adamson law and th? Ad
tration'i attitude toward buninen
at horne ar.d abro.i.i. In voice and
1 spirit Mr. Hughe? excelled any effort of
1 his campaign. He talked on the sama
topies, but he set his declaration* off
in il. 'ermined, vigorous nhrases, so that
the Garden throng kept punctuating hi*
r-peech with applause every few min?
utes. The demonstration of the Re
1 publican candidate was r-pared the mix
up and milhng of the crowd* that
marred the Democratic rally a few daya
ago. Even Democrats would admlt.
thouph, lt was ? wondrous tribute.
Mr. Hughes reached the Madison
Square Garden t 11.15, on nchedula
time.
I.reeted by Deafrning Din
The crowd was otT lo a rou?ing start
in its cheering by the time Mr. Hughes
reacBSfll the platform. Not a chair
was occupie.i, except by a pair ot
stampmg feet. It wai a deafening din.
V.i.stles, flhouts, yclls, "yehfl," "hur
rahn" and all the other aoundn tha
human voice can make on ?uch occa?
sion* were going full tilt and volume.
Kvery person m the crowd had a
