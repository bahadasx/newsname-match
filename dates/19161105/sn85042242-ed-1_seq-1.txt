Senior Senator of North Dakota
Assails Wilson and Admin­
istration.,
PRESENT PROSPERITY DUE
TO WAR SAYS SPEAKER
Candidate for Re-election Pre­
dicts Sweeping Republican
Victory
Senator Porter J. McCumber, senior
senator of North Dakota, and a candi­
date for re-election on the Republican
ticket, addressed one of the largest
political gatherings ever held in Bis­
marck at the Auditorium last evening.
The theater was packed to .capacity by
followers of the noted speaker and
other candidates of his party and he
was given' a lasting ovation by the
many in attendance. Time and again
the eloquent speaker was interrupted
by bursts of applause that reverber­
ated throughout the building as he
shot home telling truths of the pres­
ent campaign.
Urges Vote for Hughe*.
The speaker assailed the adminis­
tration and touched on'many import­
ant issues. Wilson's vacillating policy
was exposed explicitly and the rea­
sons why Charles Evans Hughes, Re­
publican candidate for thep residency,
should be elected to this office, wfcre
also exemplified. '.
Pays Tribute to Fi*azier.
Senator McCumber paid a globing
trlbuteto Lyata J. Frazier, Republican
candidate for. governor of North Da­
kota. "Mr. Frazier is a capable man
to handle the governmental reins of
this state and predict for him a
sweeping Vifctoi-y," continued the
speaker.
Senator McC limber said, in part:
"The host* of the two great politi­
cal parties have gathered their
.strength nnd are stating their view9
on a battle that means more to the
American people, and of the greatest
concern to the people of the state of
North Dat-'otn. and of the great agri­
cultural Northwest, than any battle
that has been fought out in the polit­
ical arena for many a long year.
There looms up before us on the com­
mercial horizon of the future a situ­
ation that might well challenge the
earnest and thoughtful consideration
of. every man interested in the wel­
fare of his country conditions that
are jus^ as sure to rise in the future
as this consuming war of the world
is either sooner or later to btyn -it­
s-elf to ashes. To met this condition
and to be prepared for it, the Repub­
lican national organization is loaning
its energies in this campaign. We
cannot meet them we cannot avert
the danger which they foreshadow,
with armies: or navies or physical
power. Our preparedness must be.
through the energies of the multi­
tudes of a great American commercial
policy, but we must always depend
on our own American form and never,
in time of danger, toward part of our
national life, depend on any other
thing, so we must always rely on our
All-Amerlcan commercial policy to as­
sure our future prosperity. No other
nation in the world will ever mould
its commercial relations to benefit tha
people of this country.
Prosperity Due to War.
"Now, my friends, since the 31st
day of August, 1914, we have been
living under abnormal conditions. We
have had a good volume of trade.
Hut it has been a war balance one,
and it has been principally founded
on the slaughter of millions of our
fellow beings across the sea. We
have branded the sinews of that. war.
We have alined and fed and maintain­
ed the opposing forces. And out of
their dire necessity we have reaped
a. mighty profit.- Nor is this all, to
feed that unquenchable volume of
hell, but to ruin the commercial treas­
ures of all the ages, past and also the
very manhood of Europe today. These
things have mortgaged the lives and
the energies of their childr^i's chil­
dren for centuries yet to come.
Condition* Cannot Last.
"Now, Mr. Chairman, these condi­
tions cannot an«^ will not last. Were
there no other way to choke them,
they should soon burn out. But it will
not go to that extreme. These war­
ring nations will not live. Whkt then
shall we And at the close of this great
conflict? Wte shall find a people far
less able to purchase our commodi­
ties second, that out of the exigen­
cies of this war there have been de­
veloped in each one of the contending
nations the most marvelous industrial
organizations that the world has ever

IS STjtLAT LARGE
Large Posse Continue Their Effort
To Locate Assailant of Carl
Maier
BODY OF VICTIM IS
SHIPPED TO HANOVER
SPECIAL TO*THE TRIBUNE.
Beulah, N. D., Nov. 4.—The un­
known assailant of Carl Maier, well
known and popular resident of this
town who was shot and fatally wound­
ed by a desperado on the public high­
way a short distance from town, and
died in the local hospital at midnight
last night, is still at large and all ef­
forts of the large posse, organized by
the sheriff and his deputies in an ef­
fort to-locate the criminal, has proved
unavailing. The entire country-side
has been aroused to action by the das­
tardly' deed that ended the life of ^he
unfortunate victim'. Every clue is be­
ing followed with a persistency that
in the end, it is believed, will result in
success.
Coroner's Jury Acts.
A coroner's jury today turned in a
verdict of manslaughter and the un­
known is wanted on a charge of mur­
der.
'Officers of the law in every town
and city in the state have been warned
to be on the lookout for a man On
horseback, this being the only'descrip
tin of the perpetrator available.
Motive Still a Mystery.
No motive for the crime has been
unearthed thus far and the sheriff and
his assistants are at a loss to account
for the man's queer actions. As far as
can be learned Maier was well liked
by every person in and about Beulah.
Later developments in the case have
proven that the shooting was done by
a 30-30 rifle carried by Maier. Marks
in the road, where the crime was com­
mitted, point to the fact that.a strug

Randolph, Minn., Bank, are
Still at Large
Randolph, Minn., Nov. 5.—Believing
that the bandits, who early today at­
tempted to blow the safe in the State
Bank of Randolph, have escaped to St.
Paul or Minneapolis, the hunt for the
men in this vicinity has practically
been abandoned. Late today Charles
Enos was informed that suspicious
looking men had been si en near
Northfield, but investigation there dis­
closed the fact" that the men were not
in the vicinity of Randolph at the time
of the battle between citizens of this
place and the bandits at 4 a. m. today.
No trace was left indicating where the
mandits went after the fight, In which
at least one bandit was wounded.
Marshal Enos tonight lias given up
the hunt, having worked out every
available trail without success. A
careful investigation of every hiding
place in this vicinity has not shown
any bandits, and it is thought the
wounded man of the party, who left a
trail of blood along, the sidewalk, and
another bandit, who was hit, had been
cared for by their associates and tak­
en to the biding place of the bandits.

in the presidential election of next
Tuesday, and with such a realisation
there comes a recognition of the fact
that their interests lie with the Re­
publican party," said Mr. Olson.
"I have toured the state consider­
ably, and I find the sentiment for
Hughes is very general. There is no
doubt that he will win. It is only a
question of how big majority."

New York, Nov. '4 —Charles E.
Hughes closed his campaign for the
presidency here tonight with a big
meeting at Madison Square Garden.
The speech he delivered was his fifth
of the day, and followed four in the
open air in different parts of the af­
ternoon.
Before the night jmeeting, Mr.
Hughes rode at the head of a great
torchlight procession, called a "wheel
of flame," the nine "spokes" of which
converged upon Fifth avenue. Many
thousands of men carrying flaming
torches were in line as the processions
came together one after another. So
long was the parade that it was split
into two sections, one of which march­
ed up Fifth avenue and the other up
Madison avenue to the Garden.
Explosion Cause* Excitement.
The car in which the candidate rode
was the only automobile iq line. Much
excitement was caused by an explo­
sion in Worth street, only a few feet
from Mr. Hughes, aB he sat in his aut­
omobile waiting for one of the div
sions to start. At first it was thought
a bomb had been hurled at the nomi­
nee, but Inspector fiagqn, of the Bu­
reau of Conibustibles, declared a pho­
tographer's flashlight pewder caused
the explosion. The onlR person injur­
ed, the police, said, were two news­
paper men, wfro wwtj^ntly hurL

The nominee did not seem perturb­

knowledged the plaudits of the crowd
through which he passed as the par
aders moved on fourteen abreast.
Says .Confidence is Complete.
"My voice is worn, but my heart is
stout, and my confidence is complete
that we are marching to a triumphant
victory, next Tuesday," began Mr.
Hughes. "When I first heard your
greetings, it sounded like a conven­
tion, but after a while I thought it
sounded like an election."
Thanks Coherent*.
Mr. Hughes said he desired to ex­
press appreciation of the endeavors
of those many agencies which have
co-operated to bring about the Tesult.
"To which we look so confidently,"
mentioning some of the agencies by

Plans Ready
For Returns
All plans for the Tribune's returns
on the city, county, state and nation­
al contests Tuesday evening have
been completed, and smooth-running
machinery with which to convey this
information to the public in the brief­
est possible space of time has been
completed.
The large high school projecting
machine has been procured for the
evening through the courtesy of Sup­
erintendent Martin and Principal
Bolt. Rev. WL J. Hutcheson, pastor of
McCabe Methodist Episcopal church,
has kindly loaned his large screen,
and permission has been obtained
from Henry Tatley, proprietor of the
Grand Pacific, to stretch the sheet in
front of the hotel, opposite the Trib­
une office.
The projecting machine will occupy
one of the rooms in I.inde Murphy's
suite of law dffices, which have been
dedicated to the public's service for
the evening. Especially prepared
plates upon which returns may be
written by typewriter have been pro­
vided, and the bulletins as they will
Jlash on the screen will stand out so
clearly that none can fail to read
them.
Cartoons, caricatures, portraits of
the various principal candidates, inter
erestlng bits of election news and oth­
er items which will offer variety to
the program will be interspersed "be­
tween acts." The returns will begin
to come in around S: 30 o'clock, and it
Is probable that by midnight everyone
will know who is to be the next pres­
ident of the United States, the out­
come of the senatorial contest, and
the personnel of the North Dakota sup­
reme court for the ensuing six years.
HOSKINS DONATES VICTROLA.
For the further entertainment of the
hundreds who are expected to assem­
ble to receive the returns, the Hos
kitis stationery has donated for the
evening one of its highest powered
Vietrglas, upon which selections will
be played between the acts.

McGee was arrested in Chicago

remainder of his life will be spent in
the state prison.
No trace, so far as Officer Dopking
would divulge last evening, was found
