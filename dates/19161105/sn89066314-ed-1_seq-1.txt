Clarence B. Peeples a Columbia
boy is Missouri's gridiron hero to
day. For all of three quarters and part
of the fourth, eleven Texas football
players and eleven Missouri football
players battled to a standstill, no man
on either team being strong enough
to put over the points needed for a
victory. In the fourth, Peeples went
into the game for one play and, stand
ing on the twenty-five yard line, boot
ed the pigskin between the goal posts
for the three points that won the
game.
Six thousand spectators at this
homecoming game had been waiting
anxiously for the very situation that
gave Peeples the chance to win the
game, and six thousand spectators
held their breath while the carefully
placed ball left Peeples' right foot and
went slowly toward the cross bars.
It seemed to be low and to one side,
but it easily carried to the left up
right, hit it and bounded on through
for a goal, while the crowd went wild,
and the players, now certain of vic
tory, after fighting vainly for fifty
minutes, hugged each other and
danced around the field.
v It was an ideal ending to the big
homecoming game, for after that the
Texans could do nothing against the
rejuvenated Missouri eleven. And
Peeples, whose right foot could do
tricks with the leather oval, was the
hero.
Straight Football Used.
The game Itself was lacking in
thrills but was full of straight, hard
fought football. The Tigers outplayed
their southern opponents for two
thirds of the game and outlucked them
at almost every stage of the contest.
The score probably represents very
nearly the relative strength of the two
teams, for the playing was in Texas
territory nearly all of the time. The
Texans never seriously menaced the
Missouri goal line, while the Tigers
In the middle of the second quarter.
worked the ball within five yards
of the last chalk mark, and several
other times were within striking dis
tance.
In the first two minutes of play, a
penalty for holding and a hurried
punt, which went outside before It had
carried ten yards, put the Texans on
the defensive near their own goal; but
after Bass missed a place kick, Van
Gent's men came back strong and the
playing was in Missouri territory for
the rest of the quarter. The men from
the South gained nearly half of their
total yardage in this period, while the
Tiger backfield were unable to get
under way and had to rely on Wllder's
steady punting to keep them out of
danger.
Schulte's light backfield got start
ed In the second quarter and worked
the ball down to the five-yard line,
only to lose it when Hamilton's pass to
Stankowski on attempted place kick
went wrong. The Tiger linemen also
got their bearings In this period and
opened up immense holes in the Long
horn defense. Dittmar was the biggest
factor in the Texas Line, though Ham
Hton fought his more experienced op
ponent almost to a standstill.
Becomes Punting Duel.
The Tigers also held the advantage
In the third period, but neither team
was making much yardage, both re-
sportlng to the punUng game. The duel
between Lang and Wilder was a big
feature of the game, and though the
Texan's boots were longer at umes,
Wilder's steadiness gave him the edge
on his flashier opponent Lang booted
out of bounds twice when near the
side lines and one of these cost Texas
the game.
The break came early in the fourth
Period when Lang's high punt went
out of bounds after carrying only
seven yards. Missouri made a first

OLD GRADS ANJ) STUDENTS
MINGLE AT UNION BUILDING
The "old grads" came back to the
school in which they once went to
classes. And they came back in num
bers unprecedented. It was the big
gest homecoming day yesterday
Missouri has ever had, with the excep
tion of biannual gatherings for the
Tiger-Jayhawk battles. In off years,
homecoming day does not assume the
proportions which yesterday it took
on. Hundreds of alumni poured into
Columbia to see the Tigers dehorn the
Texas steers and also to get back into
the atmosphere of their college days.
From the parade of classes in the
morning to the time-honored shirt
tail parade and barbecue at night, it
was a day of festivities. Graduate3
and students mingled at the Missouri
Union in a way that indicated the
great bond which is to unite all Mis
souri people. The day was eventful
in for nothing more than the dedica
tion of Missouri Union Building. It
was made more eventful for the alum
ni when the Tigers in the 'afternoon
displayed the fighting of "Old Mizrou"
in roping the Longhorn.
Stories of the Old Days.
The Missouri Union Building was
the center of the celebration for the
alumni. Beginning with the smoker
Friday night, they sat in the build
ing meeting old friends and class
mates and telling stories of the days
"when I was here." More than 350
were in the building, and many joined
the organization.
"The alumni are behind the Union
strong," H. H. Kinyon, secretary, said
last night. "They are surprised at its
remarkable progress in the one month
of its existence and are behind it
solidly for the $250,000 building.
The parade left the Rothwell Gym
nasium at 10:30 o'clock yesterday
morning representing the classes of
the University both in the present and
in the past. The line of march was
four blocks long. Following the band
and the cadet corps, former President
Jesse and E. W. Stephens represented
the class of '67. Then came the M
men, and the departments of the Uni
versity. For the first time in the his
tory of the school, the University
women marched in a body. The stu
dents of the College of Agriculture
lead a Texas Longhorn in the real.
The parade disbanded In front of the
Missouri Union Building.
Sam Sparrow Speaks.
Hundreds or students, alumni, mem
bers of the faculty and visitors stood
before the Missouri Union Building
when Sam Sparrow, '93, of Kansas
City, a member of the Board of Cu
rators, stepped to the front of the
porch of the building and introduced
the Rev. Charles C. Grimes, who gave
the invocation.
"The Missouri Union is destined to
be the most dominant force In the
upbuilding of the University," Mr.
Sparrow said following the invocation.
"Conceived and Inaugurated last
spring, the movement has grown unUl
now we have this temporary home
and are well on the way to the great
er building of the future."
n Introducing E. W. Stephens, the
dedicatory speaker, Mr. Sparrow
spoke of him as one of the Univer
sity's most loyal and devoted alumni,
both as a member of the Board of Cu
rators and a citizen in private life.
"After the spirit that has been

of the Student Union Building Yesterday. Insert: E. W. Stephens Making
the University today,"' Mr. Step'ons
said, "if we don't beat the Texas Long
horns, I shall haveWmove out of the
state. AltEbugh a member of the stu
dent body more than fifty years ago, I
have not lost that spirit for which
Missouri has always stood. The Mis
souri Union is an exemplification of
Uiat spirit By the dedication of the
Union Building we are marching on to
a greater glory for Missouri. It is
an institution born of the heart It
will be a home for all MIssourians.
"It will give to Missouri a wider
democracy. The co-operation will
manifest itself in the union of the
alumni and students and in the final
cementing of the student body. Here-
Ytofire-the' schooVhas been'dTrided into
clubs, fraternities and sororities. They
arc all for the good of the Univer
sity, and I wish that we had more of
them. But now the engineer will know
the farmer, the medic, the lawyer, and
we will also know the domestic sci
ence students, for they are to have a
place in this great union.
Union Aids Democracy.
"What the Michigan Union is and
will be to the University of Michigan,
the Missouri Union will be to Mis
souri. We are following the other
great universities. The Union is to
keep us of the alumni young. Its
benefit to the student will be that
of association not only with their
classmates but with the members of
the faculty as we Jiad in the days of
the past when there were only eight
or ten in each class.
"The University is not a department
store at which to purchase knowledge
but an institution of the heart as well
as the intellect The martyrs at Ox
ford as they were burned at the stake
said with their last breath they they
were lighting a fire which would
never go out; so we too, are starting
here a fire of love that will be in
extinguishable. "And now in dedicating this, the
Missouri Union Building, we are erect
ing a temple of love. We are forming
a union that will be one of the great
est powers for good in the state of
Missouri."
Following the dedicatory address, a
letter was read from the Missouri
alumni at Harvard.

Greatest Marine Disaster
Since Lusitania Occurs
Off Ireland.
By United Press
LONDON, Nov. 4. Three hundred
persons are believed to have perished
in the sinking of the small steamers
Connemara and Retriver after a col
lision on the Irish Sea last night
Only one survivor is reported thus
far. A man named Boyle, a member
of the Retriver's crew, miraculously
escaped death. He brought back the
story of the greatest sea disaster
since the sinking of the Lusitania and
prevented the disappearance of the
two ships with their passengers and
crews from becoming an untold mys
tery. Only fragmentary reports of the
disaster had reached London this .eve
ning. The Connemara was carrying fifty
one passengers. So far as is known
here none of them was an American.
Leaving Greenraore, the ferry
steamer ran into the teeth of a violent
gale. Plunging along through the
darkness and storm the smaller Re
triver, Inbound, crashed into the Con
nemara. Whether the Retriver carried
passengers is not known.
The first bodies were washed up
along the County Down coast just
north of Carlingford, Lough. At the
office of the London and Northwest
ern It was feared that excepting Boyle
every man on both vessels perished.
Forty-three bodies of the victims of
the collision between the English
steamers, Connemara and Retriver, off
the Irish coast were washed ashore
at Kilkeel.
A hurricane prevented the launch
ing of boats. William Boyle was the
one survivor.
