AM rli.lit>. r?>*-rvnl. 1
; The llnrahl presents herewith this
in 1,1 i Installment of it< national straw
vote canvass on the presidency.
In l!.'0.00f> votes cast, President TV'il
son is in the lead.
! Tin- situation rests on a. balance so
' delicate that a hair's weight may swing
it in either direction.
From the straw vote, it might he in
ferred that with a little added impetus,
the <lrift. which has- been steadily
moving in the President's direction,
initrlu grow int-> what political writers
have termed a "landslide."
* tii tin* other Itand. a back drift at
the eleventh hour might result in the
election of Mr. Hughes by a small
margin in the popular vote of import
ant States, giving a preponderance of
votes in the electoral college.
The Herald has taken its straw vote
i with customarv care. In some In-.
I stances the conclusions which might .
I>c drawn from the figures are in con
tradiction to tin- opinions of the lead
ers of both parties, and are at variance
with the persi'uil Judgment of corre
spondents who have personally vis I toil,
different States. The Herald presents
the straw-vote tin tiros for precisely
what they are worth. They speak for
themselves:, as they have in all previous
campaigns. . ?

TO\V'AItr? Mlt. TIT'CTIKS
Tli. Herahl has been told thut there
has been a recession in the swing to
ward tiic President: that the Republi
cans, who were alarmed ten days ago.
have every reason now for a feeling of
confidence. The straw vote lias not
registered a marked drift toward Mr.
Hughes. although there are indications
that there has been a slight check In
the rale ?.f the President's gain.
Of the total votes cast up to and
including te seventh and last week of ...
the canva-.-i. Mr. Hughes has received
Iv'J per cent. In the tirst week's totals,
lie received ."1.0 per cent. Jn the final
week's compilation, President "Wilson
received per cent. In thu tlrst
week he received ?)?'?.t tier cent. In
other words, the President has climbed
steadily in the straw vote. Mr. Hughes
li.is fallen hohii. t from week to week.
Likewise in the' division of the Fro
i gressive vote the nominees have moved
! in opposite directions: Mr. Hughes
[backward, the Presdcnt forward. In 1
, the latter part of September Mr.
( Hughes was getting m> per cent of the
Progressive vote and the President 17
i per cent. In the tlnal w i'ck, which, for
the actual casting of test ballots ended
ton Thursday, Mr. Hughes was rocelv- ]
' ing 7:: per cent and the President 25.1
per cent. The remainder went to Mr.
