Special Dispatch to The Star.
NEW YORK. November 4.?As the
campaign closes, dispatches from correspondents
of the New York Times
throughout the country indicate that
the result of Tuesday's election still
remains in doubt. In the middle west,
the northwest and the far west, ten
states which have been storm centers
during the closing weeks of the campaign
and which together cast 121
votes in the electoral college, are reported
to present a situation too
baffling to enable trained political observers
accurately to forecast the result.
Some of these doubtful states are re
portea 10 nave aetiucu icamuga iu??aju
President Wilson; in others the situation
is regarded as favoring the prospects
of Charles E. Hughes, the republican
nominee.
New York state is claimed by both
the republican and democratic leaders,
but reports from upstate counties,
while showing a trend toward Wilson,
indicate that New York city must roll
up a majority for President Wilson
above normal to give the state to him.
The Times does not assign New York
to either candidate. Its forty-five votes,
therefore, do not appear in the subjoined
table.
Shows Eleven States Doubtful.
Here is a summary of the prognostications
made by the correspondents in
their dispatches, after interviewing political
leaders of both the leading parties
and making a survey and analysis
of the situation in their respective
states:
Electoral vote from "safe" Wilson states... 207
Electoral vote from "safe** Hughes states... 158
Vote from ten doubtful states 121
New York unassigned 45
T?tal *. 531
Necessary to a choice 266
From the* dispatches of the Times'
correspondents it appears that the truly
pivotal states in Tuesday's election are
Ohio and Illinois. Both are in the doubtful
column.
Ohio, with its twenty-four votes in the
electoral college. is reportea to nave
leanings toward President Wilson so
strong that there is every probability the
state, which for weeks has been a battleground
In the national fight, will wind
up in the democratic column.
Illinois, with its twenty-nine electoral
votes, is claimed by the republican leaders
for Hughes, and is held by unbiased
observers to have leanings toward the
republican nominee. But the women, who
vote there for the first time in a presidential
election, hold the balance of
power
Great uncertainty prevails in both
political camps as to the trend of the
woman vote, which may decide the result
in Illinois, and possibly in the nation.
for it appears provable from the
Times* dispatches that Mr. Hughes cannot
lose both Ohio and Illinois and win
the election.
How Times Lines Up the States.
Here are figures showing how the
Times' dispatches indicate the electoral
vote will be divided, with the
votes of the various states in the
electoral college:
For Wilson?Alabama. 12: Arizona, 3;
Arkansas. 9; Colorado, 6: Florida, 6;
Georgia, 14: Kentucky. 13; Louisiana,
10; Maryland. 8; Mississippi. 10; Missouri.
18; Montana. 4; Nebraska, 8;
Nevada. 3; North Carolina. 12; Oklahoma.
10; South Carolina, 9; Tennessee,
12; Texas. 20; Virginia, 12; West Virginia.
8 Total. 207.
For Hughes?California, 13; Delaware.
3; Idaho. 4: Iowa. 13; Kansas.
10; Maine. 6; Massachusetts. 18; New
Hampshire. 4; New Jersey, 14; North
Dakota. 5; Oregon 5; Pennsylvania. 38;
Rhode Island, 5; Vermont. 4: Wisconsin.
13; Wyoming, 3. Total, 158.
Here are figures showing states designated
by The Times' correspondents
as doubtful:
Connecticut. 7: Illinois. 29; Indiana.
15; Michigan. 15; Minnesota 12: New
Mexico. 3: Ohio. 24; South Dakota. 5;
t'tah. 4. Washington. 7. Total. 121.
Renorts from such states as Ohio,
Michigan. Minnesota, Illinois and Indiana.
where three weeks ago conditions
favored President Wilson, indicate
that the republicans have taken
bold of the situation aggressively in
the hope of checking the drift to Wilson
and turning it to Hughes. Howfar
they may have succeeded cannot
be known until the votes are counted.

MR. WILSON MAKES
COERCION CHARGE
IN CLOSING SPEECH
Claims Opponents Are Filling
Country With Alarms After
Despairing of an Issue.

NOW ONLY THE BETTING"

i President Says Political Capital Is
I Made Out of Questions Which
Might lead to War.
f.
j By the Associated Press.
| LONG BRANCH, N. J., November 4 ?
President Wilson closed his campaign
for re-election at Shadow Lawn today
with a speech in which he accused the
opposition of attempting to coerce workingmen
and charged that political
capital is being made out of unsettled
questions "which, if not settled wisely,
might bring this country at any time
into the world conflict."
Predicting democratic victory next
Tuesday, the President declared:
"Having despaired of an issue, they
are Ailing the country with alarms.
They are not only filling the country
with alarms, but they are attempting
coercion of their laborers.' They imagine
that these men are not their own
masters, and dare not vote as they
think, but at last, I thank God, the
American laDOrer is a wane:
' Control Nothing But Betting/'
"Let them fill the coyntry with
alarms: the alarms are their own, not
ours. They used to control the credit
of the country; now they control nothing
but the betting."
"So. my fellow citizens," he continued.
"I feel rising in my pulses already
the inspiration and impulse which is to
come, not only to the United States, but
to the world, next Tuesday. I do not
identify myself with this. To me has
fallen the unspeakable good fortune of
happening to be the spokesman of the
American people at this critical and
fateful time."
Mr. Wilson asserted that the republican
party had fallen back on the protective
tariff as its only issue.
"They know perfectly well," he said,
"that all the pretenses about the protective
tariff have been torn away,"
adding that the industries with the
I highest protection have paid the lowest
wages.
"Offer Comrades and Leaders/'
"The difference between the repubj
lican party and thfe democratic party is
! this." he continued: "The republicah
J party offers them masters; we offer
j them comrades and leaders. The re
publican party offers to take care of
them: we offer to go into the fight
shoulder to shoulder with them to get
the rights which no man has a right to
give them."
The New Jersey political situation
was handled directly by Mr. Wilson.
He said that any man voting for the
I republican ticket in that state is vot}
ing for "invisible government."
The President's address was delivered
before a large gathering which came
from Jersey City, Newark, Trenton,
Princeton and other towns and cities
in the state, including a delegation of
i Princeton professors and . students.
I Gov. Fielder of New Jersey presided.

?
President's Speech.
President Wilson said, in part:
"I must say it has been very hard in
recent we^ks not to take off my coat
and get back into the fighting that is
now developing in this state in the effort
to reinstate in power the men
whom we routed six years ago and held
up to the reprobation and contempt of
i all lovers of just and true government,
because it is apt to stir the blood very
hotly to see these men trying to get
into power again.
"We have heard a great deal of talk j
in condemnation of invisible govern- ;
ment. invisible government never existed
in more hateful form than it has
existed in past years in this state of
New Jersey, and that invisible government
never had more successful places
of concealment than it had in such
localities as Atlantic City, from where
the candidate for governor on the republican
side has been chosen, and it
never received more successful and perj
sistent defense than it has received

j and controls.

MR. HUGHES GIVEN
NEW YORK OVATION
AT CLOSING RALLY
Marching Thousands in Wheel
of Flame Yield Brilliant
Ribbons of Light.
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
IN UPROAR 40 MINUTES
Republican Candidate Declares He Is
Confident of Election Result.
Defends American Spirit.
By the Associated Press.
NEW YORK, November 4.?Charles
E. Hughes closed his campaign for the
presidency in this city tonight with a
big meeting at Madison Square Garden.
The speech he delivered was his fifth
of the day and followed four in the
open air in different parts of the city
during the afternoon.
Before the night meeting Mr. Hughes
rode at the head of a great torchlight
procession called a "wheel of flame,"
the nine "spokes" of which converged
upon 5th avenue. Many thousands of
men, each carrying a flaming torch,
were in line as the procession came together,
one after another. So long was
the parade that it was split into two
sections, one of which marched up 5th
avenue and the other up Madison avenue
to the garden.
Long Ribbons of Light.
The broad avenues were filled with
long riDDons or ngnt as ine repuoucan i
cohorts moved onward. Interspersed at
frequent intervals were bands which
played martial and patriotic airs. The
car in which the candidate rode was
the only automobile in line.
Much excitement was caused by an explosion
in Worth street only a few feet ?
from Mr. Hughes as he sat in his automobile
waiting for one of the divisions #
of the parade to start. It was believed I
at first that a bomb had been hurled at I
the nominee, but Inspector Egan of the V
bureau of combustibles declared a photographer's
flashlight powder caused the explosion.
The only persons injured, the
police said, were two newspaper men,
who were slightly hurt.
With Mr. Hughes in his car were A.
Bartin Hepburn and two detectives. The
nominee did not seem perturbed by the
incident, and smilingly acknowledged
the plaudits of the crowds through which
he passed as the paraders moved on, fourteen
abreast.
March in Drizzling Bain.
A drizzling rain which began falling
just as the parade began dampened somewhat
the ardor of the demonstration 3
which greeted the republican candidate. ?
but cheering crowds lined 5th avenue from n
the time he passed under the Dewey arch n
in Washington Square. n
More adequate and elaborate police ?
arrangements at Madison Square and in P
that vicinity prevented a repetition of h
the crush which greeted President ,
Wilson Thursday night. The big
building was comfortably filled by 7 81
o'clock, but most of the crowd which r<
had gathered evidently wanted to see
the parade before seeking admission. ^
Every seat was taken, however, when
the blare of bands heralded the candi- A
date's coming. ri
Mrs. Hughes, accompanied by her p
three daughters?Helen, Catherine and j
Elizabeth?Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. j ?):
Hughes, jr., and several friends were t?
among the early arrivals. They oc- f<

Cheers for Roosevelt.
William A. Prendergast, controller of
the city of New York, formally opened
the meeting at 8:20 o'clock. * Speaking Q
of a reunited republican party, he re- n
ferred to that "wonderful American," tj
Theodore Roosevelt. Instantly the ^
crowd began to cheer and the demonstration
lasted several minutes. *
Mr. Hughes entered the hall at 9:15 11
while Gov. Whitman was speaking.
The governor's speech was abruptly
ended by a roar from the audience.
which kept up seven minutes. The ^
crowd then began to shout, "Hughes. j?(
Hughes, Hughes,* "We want Hughes."
The nominee waved a small flag. s|
The crowd settled down after fifteen
minutes to a steady rhythm of e
"Hughes, Hughes, Hughes." The cheer- t<
ing had been going on twenty-six it
minutes when Mrs. Hughes was es- d
corted to the balcony beside her hus- tl
band. At this the audience redoubled tl
its noise. Charles E. Uughes, jr., and 1<
his wife followed, and then the nom- ?
inee's daughters, so that the nominee's
entire family was grouped
around him.
At the end of thirty minutes the
crowd had settled down to a steady
stamping of feet in unison. A band H[
played a verse of "AnId Rang Syne."
and when it stopped the cheering and
stamping began again.
Mammoth Flag Unfurled.
A mammoth flag was unfurled from
the ceiling, the band played "The Star J
Spangled Banner" and the audience j
ceased cheering to sing. Mr. Hughes
was introduced at 9:55 o'clock, after
the demonstration had lasted forty v
minutes. b
"My voice is worn, but my heart is stout,
and my confidence is complete
that we are marching to a triumphant
victory next Tuesday," began Mr.
Hughes. "When 1 first heard your
greeting it seemed to sound like a convention,
but after a while 1 thought it
sounded like an election."
Mr. Hughes said he desired to express
appreciation of the endeavors of
those many agencies which have co
operated to bring about the result "to
which we look forward so confidently,"
mentioning some of the agencies by
name.
"How about Teddy?" shouted a man
in the audience. A general laugh followed.
"And I include, of course," the
nominee said a moment later, "both of
our distinguished ex-Presidents who
have in their earnest support aided this
cause by presenting once more a reunited
republican party as the agency
of national service.
"To Record Decisive Conviction."
"It has been quite apparent for some
time that the American people were
about to record a very decisive con(Continued

BIRMINGHAM. Ala.. November 4.?
federal and state mine rescuers who
onight penetrated the Bessie mines
f the Sloss-Sheffleld Steel and Iron
Company, near here, where early today
iighteen negroes and nine white men
vere entombed as the result of a gas
explosion, believe at least eight of the
niners are still alive. This belief is

occurred.
None of the victims has been re- j
rioved since early this morning, when !

PARTISAN POLITICS
OF LABCW SCORED
Teachers' Union Strongly Disapproves
Federation's Support
of President Wilson.
WRITES TO MR. GOMPERS
Partisan politics on the part of organized
labor came in for criticism last night
when one local union affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor, the High
School Teachers' Union, expressed stern
disapproval of the action of that body,
through its officers and legislative council,
in urging by direct inference the reelection
of President Wilson. Efforts were
also made by certain officers and mem
bers of another big local, the Federal Employes'
Union, to bring about the adoption
of similar resolutions, but the attempt
was brought to naught by the arguments
of other members acting on the "safety
first" principle.
The High School Teachers* Union, by
its president, Roy C. Claflin, in a letter
addressed to President Gompers expressed
sincere regret that "the great
national labor organization should have
been drawn into the political campaign,"
and voiced the "belief that that
organization should be above political
partisanship, and that its greatest usefulness
can be attained only through
non-partisanship."
"Cause of Labor May Be Injured."
"We believe," the letter stated, "that
the cause of labor may be materially
injured by the fact that its leaders
are endeavoring to align - the millions
of labor votes behind one of the tickets
in a national election. It would have
seemed entirely proper for those officials
to have exerted their efforts as
a personal matter; but for them to use
the official channels, offices, money and
advantages of the Federation of Labor I
to further the interests of one candi- I
date is obviously unfair to the great j
numbers of organized labor men whose j
political views differ from the views
of yourself (President Gompers) and
official associates."
Mr. Claflin's letter stated that in the
High School Teachers' Union "it is |
not alone the Hughes members who
protest having the Federation of Labor I
drawn into politics, but it is just as
strongly resented by those jnembers I
wno favor the re-eiectton or ^resident
Wilson, the latter numbering about 20
per cent of our total membership, this
estimate being: based on an informal
canvass of the individual members."
President Claflin's Letter.
"We are a newly affiliated body,"
President Claflin's letter continued, i
"and it was my first judgment that, i
like a new member of Congress, we |
should be 'seen and not heard.* How-I

"In affiliating with the Central Labor i
Union of Washington and with the
Federation of Labor our official representatives
took an obligation of allegiance
on behalf of our union in which
it was granted that our affiliation
would in no way interfere, among other
things, with our politics. Needless to
say then we were, as an organisation,
surprised to be drawn into politics and
officially aligned on one side against
the other without our consent and
without being consulted.

Federal Employes Beject Resolution.
At a secret meeting of the board of representatives
of the Federal Employes'
Union in the rooms of the Chamber of
Commerce expression by resolution of disapproval
of the action of the American
Federation of Labor officials was sought.
After extended argument, however, the
resolution condemning the effort to "deliver"
the labor vote to the incumbent of
the White House was not even presented,
a "middle of the road" resolution being
adopted by practically unanimous vote of
the representatives present, nearly 100 in
number.
The resolution finally adopted recited
the public impression gained through
the press that President Gompers had
specifically requested all union members
to support President Wilson,
which impression, the resolution said,
was erroneous.- It was further recited
that in view of the fact that government
employes are prohibited by civil
service regulations from taking anyactive
part in political campaigns,
therefore, the Federal Employes' Union,
while recognizing the great influence
of the American Federation of I^abor j
as exerted in behalf of the federal em- \
ployes, for which the union felt grateful.
should take an absolutely non- j
partisan stand in the present campaign
and should take no official action as a j
union toward indorsing: any candidate j
for public office. I
The meeting was attended by prac- i
ticallv all of the members of the board I
of representatives, representing a total!
membership in the local organization j
of more than 5.000, or more than five- j
sevenths of the total membership of r
all federal employes' unions through-1
out the United States. After the roll I >
call and brief discussion of routine J,
business the meeting was adjourned
so that discussion of resolutions of a
political nature might not occur at a
regular or called meeting of the rep-; ,
