day next as announced till next Tues
day evening, the ,10th of May, at 8 p.
m., at the Early hotel. Messrs. Birch
field & Rentier, new owners of the Ear
ly, offer a banquet menu that promises
to excel any heretofore provided for
the club. The seating capacity will be
120 persons. As 9!) were served in
April it is expected that the entire 120
plates will be reserved early, so mem
bers are requested to reserve plates
for themselves and any friends whom
they may wish to entertain as guests,
before Monday next." k is essential
that members who order plabes be
present; send a substitute it absence
is necessary, or pay part of the cost,
as though present. This Ts the most
essential featurj of these banqs,
and it the club is to continue without
regular monthly dues, , each membtf
must co-operate in" this respect. No
requirement is maire for attendance
,bnt after, a plate is reserved by. the
committee it js expected that someone
will appear t a oVjupy the place or ptj'
the price. This statement is made be
cause lust month seventeen reserva
tions were made, which were not oc
cupied, and only two of this seventeen
sent the 85c, and If it had not been
for extra visitors who came In at the
last hour, the committee would have
been burdened by having to pay for
the fojks who promised to come and
did not, and who failed to pay. It Is
hoped that the plan as originally made
can be carried out so that folks who
want to attend pay for what they get,
Knd no pay it not in attendance; this

music provided, if possible.
Remember, a pood time is promised,
a real banquet, enly 120 can be accom
modated, and members come? first, if
they reserve first; starting on the
minute of 8 p. .to be. through by
10 p. m.; no lopg, but pithy and witty,
and even very logical and eloquent
speeches, and lots of fun and jokes.
If an earlier hour could have Wen ar-'
ranged it would have been, but it is
impossible this time. Hold your ap
petite till ,? p. in. and you will not re
gret the denial of usual early dinner.

"HELP, HO
HORATIO"
HAIR GONE
Gallant Chief Hastens to Heed Call of
Deeply Distressed Damsel; Cruel
Crime is Charged to Play
ful Breezes
"Helio! Is this the chief of police?
It is? Well, say, chief, for the love of
Pete come to blank hundred and blank
Blank street just as quick as your
auto will carry you. Come right now!
What's the matter? Don't waste time
asking, but come. Someone has stolen
my hair!" ,
Such was the message which drib
bled into the ars of the Big Chief, in
excitedly brosen accents over the tel
ephone this morning.
With visions of the "Rape of the
Lock" and of bold, bad men with keen
bladed shears "berefting" a fair dam
sel's head of its flowing curls of sun
kissed waves of glory, the Big Chief
climbed aboard his wheezing car, set
tled his 275 pounds of avoirdupois' be
hind the wheel, honked a couple of
times anh gave the machine the gas.
Down one street and up another;
turning corners, perilously, on two
wheels; utterly disregarding all speed
ordinances, the bold chief dashed on
ward until he arrived in front of the
designated number. And there he
found the fair damsel in distress. The
damsel was waving her arms about
her bead and shouting and weeping,
wailing and gnashing her teeth and
refusing to be comforted.
There, there." said the chief in
soothing-accents, "there, there. Cheer
up. The worst may yet come. Tell
us all about it."
And. the damsel told him. She stat
ed that the evening before she had
washed her hair and hung it on the
i lothes line in the back yard to dry
and this morning when she went out
in the yard to secure her dried crown
ing glory the whole liattlesfcip, more
properly speaking, tho whole scalp-
lock, had disappeared.
The premises were searched by the
Big Chief for incriminating foot
prints; no such piints were, however,
found. Then the Big Chief called the
station and told the desk sergeant to
send out a still alarm instructing all
patrolmen and pluin .clothes men to
keep a sharp lookout for a nme dollar
bunch of peroxide golden locks. And
then, just as the thief began turning
over his engine in the vain effort to
start his snorting machine without
.swearing, a bad little boy. who had
constituted himself a member of the
searching party, shouted and danced
ii an unholy glee as he pointed to the
roof of a nearby coal shed. .Following,
with their eyes, the direction indicated
by the young American's grimy finger,
the Big Chief and the damsel fair saw
the lost locks fluttering breezily upon
the apex of the coal shed root and

DELEGATES
GUESTS AT
LUNCHEON
By United Press.
New York, May 24. Perhaps the
most striking feature on today's pro
gram of the biennial conference of the
Fed'ated Women's Clubs of America
here is the luncheon, served in the
mammoth Seventh Regiment armory,
at which Mrs. John Hays Hammond is
hostess to 30,000 American clubwomen
and a group of Washington society wo
men. Mis. Hammond is not a cluji'woimni,
but because of her work as chairman
of the executive council of the Wo
man's Welfare Department of the Na
tional Civic Fco'Ttion, she was made
chairman of the advisory committee
of the Federation.
"We are not here to entertain in a
vacuous way for. the giddy, skittish,
gabbling women," said Mrs. Hammond
today, "but we are entertaining the
best and most thoughtful women of
the country, many of whom had to
make great' personal sacrifices to get
here and who are seriously concerned
with bettering conditions that so sore
ly need bettering among us.
"I am particularly interested in the
establishment of a world court such
as Is now under consideration'and in
which women and their interests
should play a big part.
"History Is in the making. Shall it
again chronicle that woman has left
her paradise to be guarded solely by
the flaming sword? It swords are
needed, we must have swords and
plenty of them. Events have shown
that to be unprepared Is to invite dis
aster, but swords and guns and arma
ment of war are only the primitive
needs of a nation.
"The home is the citaJel or our na
tional life. To safeguard its strength,
to protect its moral soundness, to keep
high the glorious banners of our na
tional ideals; these are the x, duties
which call to American women today.
"Men ot America, let us give you
help. In the, name ot American wo
manhood I offer you our service.
Take us into your councils as we
must certainly share in your sorrows
if mistakes be made."
Mrs. Hammond's is one of the big
gest luncheons ever given.
Just imagine bow much of a job it
would be to supply each guest with
nothing more than a glass of water.
Thirty thousand glasses of water, 30.
000 knives and 30,000 forks, 30,000
plates of soup and .10,000 napkins,
ninety thousand spoons and maybe
2N1.000 to SiKMHM dishes.
Pity the- poor dishwasher on a day
like this!
The luncheon is being staged in the
armory, probably the only place irt
New York large enough for it to be

Chicago, May 24. All is in readiness
for the thousands of women who will
attend the Woman's Party convention
here, June 5, 6, and 7, in answer to
the call of the Congressional Union.
Suffragists from all enfranchised
states will determine ho they can
throw their votes In the next election
in order to best serve the cause ot nation-wide
suffrage tor women.
The last day of this convention wilt
be the first day of the Republican
conclave. ' - .
The Union has just completed art
invasion of the west undertaken ta
consolidate the Congressional Union
branches tn the. already enfranchised
states. 1 '
The workot organizing the convene
tion is being pushed lu every district
In Chicago through the women's clubs,
societies and Industrial organizations.
Miss Alice Paul, national chairman,
and a notable group of 'militant scouts
are in charge. The activities are di
rected from "field" headquarters on
Michigan Boulevard.
Miss Mabel Vernon o( belaware,
who organised, nearly half the enrrao.
chised states in suppoirt ot the tederal
amendment will arrlvie soon to direct;
a campaign of street meetings.
Miss Doris Stevens, head of the na
tional organization department, Is her
in charge ot the open air demonstra-
tions and mass meetings that -will
punctuate the suffrage calendar be
tween now ,and. convention time.
Miss Elizabeth Elder of Philadel
phia has taken charge of the informa
tion bureau and will later enroll all
delegates. ' The work ot directing the
out-of-door publicity is la the hands
of Miss S. Ada Flatman of London,
England, one of Mrs. Pankhurst'a
lieutenants in the early days or the
militant movement. ;
The jirogram will be mainly In tts
bands of the voting women. Among
the speakers will be Misa Maude
Younger, member ot the National Ad
visory Council of the Union, Mrs. Sara
Bard Field, envoy from the Woman
Voters convention in San Francisco,

of California; Miss Anne Martin of
Nevada, member ot the national leg

i Phelps Buell, state factory Inspector
1 of Colorado and member ot the Na-
tional Advisory Council of the Union.
A hospitality committee headed by
Mrs. Clifford Wells, a prominent so
ciety woman, is in charge of the work;
of securing accommodations for tha
hosts who will begin to arrive in a few
days. Unable to secure rooms in the
fashionable hotels, the committee has
leased a number of small suburban
hotels.
Contrary to reports that the Tnlon

j lanl. the national chairman, declared
uiuujr uim me organization is stnul
non-partisan and is working solely for
nation-wide enfranchisement of all wo-'
men.
A review of the suffrage situation in
the house shows, suffragists say, that
the Democrats have blocked the
amendment.
Miss Paul is explicit In giving rea
sons for the formation of the new par
ty. "If women who are Republicans
simply help the Republican party, and
women who are Democrats simply
help the Democratic party," she said,
"women's votes won't count tor much.
But when the political parties see be
