That Rubbish Dump.
Mr. Editor:
In regard to the unsightly rubbish
dump mentioned last week in this
paper, I would like to know who has
waked up. This dump was staited two
years ago and last spring I tried to
have it stopped. One of the men in
the town told me that if I could prove
that it made or caused any sickness
he would stop it and the first selectman
of the town said that it was my place
to stop it and not his. I offered to
clean up the thing if he would post it
and he refused to do that and I told
him if I posted it I would dump the
stuff in the lake.
I was surprised to see this mentioned
in the paper as everybody knows it's
there and I call it one of the beautiful
sights in the beautiful village of Bar
ton. L. J. Grondin.

You are cordially invited to attend

Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
The morning sermon was on "Heed
less Jehu," text, II Kings 10-31. Had
Jehu employed his opportunities he
might have become the benefactor of
his people and written. his name in the
annals of the nation, but through heed
lessness he missed all that was worth
while, although according to the
world's standpoint he had all that one
could wish. What really counts, how
ever, is true goodness. Man may have
all knowledge, but if he have no person
al knowledge of Jesus Christ as his
Saviour, God says he is a fool. All
that we have or are is a gift from God
and we should acknowledge him in all
things and consecrate everything to his
service. Too often there is a great gulf
between what we are and what we
ought to be. Heedlessness to our ways
brings its punishment as it did to Jebu
long ago.
The evening talk was upon
"Watch-
words for the Christian Life."

BASEBALL
In a game off baseball which was in
teresting and well played, especially
after the third inning, People's acade
my of Morrisville defeated B. A. Fri
day at Roaring Brook-Park by the score
of 18 to 0. To be defeated by a team ,
of the calibre of P. A., is no disgrace
to any team and it is said that P. A.
has one of tbe best school teams that has
visited Barton in some years. In the
first of three innings the visiting t earn
scored 12 runs on seven hits and seven
errors but after that the B. A. boys
seemed to recover from their fright
at the size of the visitor and played a
hard snappy game, in two inning3
getting three put-outs after the P. A.
had filled the bases. For the visitors
the only players who had much to do
were the battery and first baseman,
their two pitchers getting 19 strikeouts.
The home team was encouraged by the
showing it made against great odds.
The score by innings was as follows :
Inning 123456789 R H E
P.A. 543010302 18 15 1
B. A. 000000000 018
Batteries: For P. A., Silloway, C.

uarton academy won its second vic
tory over Craftsbury academy defeat
ing the C. A. boys at Craftsbury Sat
urday 17 to 11. Barton played a good
game and the outcome of the contest
was never in doubt. W. Abbott pitched
a good game for B. A. A crowd of B.
A. girls showed good school spirit by
going to Craftsbury to see the game.
The score :

xiic- nucijiiaijce at rriaay s game
both of school pupils and of towns
people was noticeably small. Although
the home team is not winnincr manv
games the boys are playing hard and
deserve better support at the games.
it costs money to get visiting teams
here and to pay a $20 guarantee on a
$5 crowd is not a profitable proposition.
What promises to be one of the best
games of the season will be played at
Roaring Brook Park Saturday, May 27,
when Barton academy meets Derby
academy in the second game of the
season. Derby defeated Barton at
Derby by the score of 11 to 10 in a ten
inning game, so you can easily see that
the teams are evenly matched and that
Barton will work hard to even things
with Derby. The admission will be
15 cents for everybody. Remember, 15
cents for everybody, as a special in
ducement instead of 25 cents, to get a
crowd at the game. Game called at
2.30.
ORLEANS VS. BARTON.
On Thursday afternoon, May 25, Bar
ton academy will play the return game

Brook Park. The mere fact that Or
leans and Barton are to play insures a
hard game. Admission 15 cents. Game
called at 4 p. m.
