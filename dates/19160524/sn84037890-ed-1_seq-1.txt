ROAD BONDS OF $000,000
SOLD AT NICE PREMIUM
Owensboro, Ky., May 20. One of
the largest road bond Issues ever
disposed of In Kentucky was sold
here by the Daviess County Fiscal
Court, when the bid of Seasongood
& Mayer, of Cincinnati, for the en
tire Issue of $000,000, was accepted.
The bid of the Cincinnati firm was
in part as follows:
"For the $600,000 Daviess county,
Kentucky, 4 per cent, road and
bridge bonds, dated December 31,
1915; due $100,000 December 31,
1921; and $20,000, December 31,
1922; and $20,000 annually-thereafter
up to and including December
31, 1946; denominations $.r)00 prin
cipal and semi-annual interest pay
able at some bank in New York
City; we offer par (that Is $600,000)
accrued interest to date of delivery
of the bonds to us and a premium of
$4,200."
The interest on the bonds will
amount to $13,500 on June 1, when
it is expected they will be delivered.
The issue was voted last year. Its
validity has been passed on by the
highest courts of Kentucky. This
was the fourth time that bids had
been received. The delay in selling
them was occasioned by the strained
relations between the United States
and Germany.
The Fiscal Court will immediately
prepare to let the contracts for tho
construction of the rock roads. It
is believed that between seventy-iivo
and eighty miles of roads can be
constructed with the $600,000. Da
viess county already has nearly fifty
miles of rock roads.
RIOTERS USED COFFINS
TO ESCAPE FROM DUBLIN
London, May 21. In the first ex
citement of the round-up by tho mil
itary authorities of the' participants
in the Dublin uprisings after the
leaders began to surrender, a number
of SinnFelners escaped in coffins, ac
cording to a report that has reached
here through the Sinn Fein "under
ground railroad." The escapes are
said to have been facilitated by the
momentary relaxation of the unu
sual rules concerning death and bur
ial certificates.
The method was complete. Tho
supposed corpse would be placed in
a hearse and followed by a few
friends to the burial ground. After
tho services at the grave the priest
would be called away and engaged
in conversation, thus giving the
grave diggers an opportunity to sur
round the coffin and lift up tho
"corpse."
The released man was able to
walk to a secluded end of the grave
yard and thus to liberty,

To Approve It.

Calling For $240,000,000 Outlay
Largest Sum Ever Asked
From Congress.
THE SENATE IS RELIED UPON
Washington, May 20. Adminis
tration forces In Congress lost the
first skirmish in the naval prepared
ness campaign when the House Com
mittee broke a five-day deadlock,
and completed the naval appropria
tion bill without approving the five
year building program advocated by
President Wilson and Secretary
Daniels.
As finally agreed to the bill au
thorizes the construction 'in 1917 of
five battle cruisers, as against two
dreadnaughts ftn'd two battle cruis
ers recommended by Secretary Dan
iels; four scout cruisers, an increase
of one over the department's pro
gram; ten destroyers as against fif
teen recommended; twenty subma
rines, three to be 800-ton boats,
compnred with five fleet and twenty
five coast submarines recommended,
one hospital ship, one oil fuel ship
and one ammunition ship. The gun
boat recommended was stricken out
and fuel and ammunition ships were
added from Daniels' second year
program.
The total amount tho bill carries
is $240,000,000, the largest naval
appropriation ever presented to Con
gress. While the approbation Is, If any
thing, an increase over the depart
ment's plans, the failure of the five
year program and the fact that no
dreadnaughts are provided for, will
make the bill unsatisfactory to ad
ministration officials. Secretary Dan
iels said that he would never
lose hope of getting what he asked
for until Congress had adjourned.
He clearly Indicated the Senate,
which has not yet taken up the con
sideration of the naval bill even In
committee, can be relied upon to re
store the battleships.
Chairman Padgett was not only
forced by conditions of the dead
look to abandon the five-year pro
ject, but was also forced to accept
tho provision proposed by Represen
tative Hensley. authorizing the Pres
ident to call a conference of world
powers at the conclusion of the Eu
ropean war to draw plans for an In
ternational peace tribunal. An ap
propriation of $200,000 for this pur
pose carried, which would authorize
the President to appoint nine citi
zens, distinguished as lawyers and
peace advocates, to represent the
United States.

needle swallowed by her over twenty
years ago, was removed.
According to Dr. Barr, Mrs. Goodo
has been suffering from severe pains
for the past two or three months.
She stated to her physician that she
believed her suffering was brought
about by a needle she had swallowed
over twenty years ago.
Friday Mrs. Goode was brought to
Owensboro, where Dr. J. J. Rodman
took an X-ray photograph of Uio
affected part, which clearly Indicat
ed the presence of the foreign sub
stance. Local anesthetics were ad
ministered and the needle removed.
Mrs. Goode Is reported as resting
easily from the operation and will
be up and about her duties during
the week.
The needle Is a common gold-eyed
sewing needle, about two Inches long
and allows but slight corrosion.

AN UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL
In tranquil retirement after an
active political life, having served
four: years as Governor of his State
and twenty-two years In the United
States Senate, George C. Perkins, of
California, now seventy-six years
old, has cast partisanship aside to
pay a simple, whole-hearted tribute
to the statesmanship of President
Woodrow Wilson.
For more than two score years
Mr. Perkins was the dominant po
litical force of the Republican party
of- California; For- more than a
score of years he was one of the
strongest Republican leaders of the
Senat". He was chairman of the
Navnl Affairs Committee of the Sen
ntetand, In that post, had much to
do jWlth the naval policy of the
country.
Now, after a lifetime of leader
ship hi the Republican party, out of
the wisdom based on long experi
ence In 'llie affairs of tho United
States, and out of the knowledge of
the world's history, he has summed
up the debt that the nation owes to
President Wilson In the following
letter:
"24 Market St., San Francisco, Call.
"To the President, the White House,
Washington, D. Ct
"fle.ar Mr. President: I .hope
you will not think I am presuming
In tendering you my personal con
gratulations upon the splendid ad
ministration that you are giving to
our country, which has won for you
the admiration and respect of the
people.
"Your wise statesmanship, which
has kept our nation from conflict
with other nations, Is the strongest
evidence of your knowledge of the
resources and advantages of our
great country.
"Hoping the Great Giver of all
things' will prosper you and yours
In all of your undertakings, I re
main. Very respectfully,
"GEORGE C. PERKINS."
This spontaneous tribute, coming
from a patriotic Republican, thank
ful for the nation's security, and the
upholding of Its honor In a time of
world-upheaval, Is typical of the new
era In politics. Other stalwart Re
publicans, as well as Progressives
and Independents, have written
onually commendatory letters to tha
President. Mr. Perkins gave his
consent to the publication of his let
ter. PRISONER TAKES IHUDE

FIERCE STRUGGLE
YETJGONTINUES
Verdun Fight Enters On
Fourth Month.
FRENCH DEFjNSEJS STRONG
Germans, Despite Failure Thus
Far to Take Fortress, Still
Hammer Away.
DEAD MAX HILL THE OBJECT
Paris, May 22. The battle of
Verdun, the longest and most bitter
ly contested Individual struggle of
tho war, enters on Its fourth month
to-day. The Germans, with charac
teristic patience and stubbornness,
are hammering at Dead Man Hill,
where tho most furious and bloody
fighting of the three-months' con
flict has taken place. Clinging des
perately to the trenches they have
wrested from the French on the low
er 3loPes of the hill, the Teutons
have hurled tJO.fr&O riitn; -backwl- br
slxty batteries of guns of all cali
bers, forward along a seven-mile
front from Avocourt wood to the
Meuse In a desperate attempt to
seize the coveted summit.
As has been usual In this war
when either side launched a well
prepared and strongly delivered of
fensive, the attacking forces have
won Initial advantages. The Ger
mans have succeeded In gaining a
footing In the French first line at a
cost of severe losses. However,
Judging from the experiences of the
past, it will not be a difficult task
for the French to dislodge them be
fore they are able to follow up their
advantage. Both slde3 will then
return to their former positions to
await another offensive.
That the Germans must contlnue
ihelr tremendous onslaught on Dend
Man Hill or abandon the Idea of
taking Verdun seems obvious. This
blood-soaked summit and its sister
eminence, Hill 304, form the key of
the whole system of Verdun's de
fenses. The fire from their batteries
flanks the Douaumont plateau across
the river. Without the undisputed
possession of this plateau military
critics agree that no attack on Ver
dun has any chance of success.
A neutral diplomat who has Just
returned from Albania is quoted In
a dispatch to the Matin from Athens
as saying that the Austrlans have
withdrawn 50,000 troops from Al
bania In tho last three weeks.
Heavy Fighting.
Paris, May 22. French grena
diers occupied several blockhouses
In Avocourt wood on the Verdun
front In the course of severe fight
ing last night.
The struggle west of Dead Man
Hill was terrlffic. The War Office
statement this afternoon says that
the attacks of German Infantry were
repulsed.
The blockhouses In Avocourt wood
were abandoned by the Germans.
East of the Meuse, Infantry fighting
occurred at the Haudromont quar
ries captured yesterday by the
French. The Germans attacked
theso positions and, the statement
asserts, were ropulsed with heavy
loss.
