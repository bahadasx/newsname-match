WASHfSNCxTON, Mlay 24.—Though
thont official advance information
to the contents of General Car

thoritles doubted today there would
any actual demand for American
op withdrawal from Mexico.
They thought, however, Carranza

If he can convince the administra

lowever, tbe war department has not
regarded his forces sufficiently strong
to
assure the border against raids
Nor has It regarded its own work
of scattering bandits as accomplished.
If Carranza does demand immed

placated, officials said. In as mnch as
considerable of his talk along these
lines hair undoubtedly been for hom

bandits are recruiting In the wake

according to information received
here today from Pershing's front.
The remnant pf the bands dispersed
by the United States troops are con

them that Villa is coming back to

loot, which they say wtll be left by
the Americans on their flight north.
General Pershing has sent several
scouting parties south of the ad

to these movements and report to
General Funston their importance.
Headquarters today received what

FRANCE
PARIS, May 24.—Ten thousand
men have gone down to slaughter in
what Is rlapidly becoming the Mood
iest engagement of the three month's
'battle of Verdun.
From Dead Man's hill eastward to
the ruins of Fort Douaumont, the
most savage struggle In any theatre
of war in thp past two months Is be
ing waged.
The Germans last night rolled
eighty thousand men up against the
French works on Dead Man's hill,
while two German brigades time and
again rushed the French defenders of
Douaumont.
The fighting in the rulne of the fort
attained the greatest violence at nopn
yesterday. The Germans bathed
French positions from Thiaumont to
Douaumont In a steady drum fire.
From behind great clouds of dust
thrown up by shells, the grey col
umns of Germans emerged on a mad
run for the French works. While
Frenoh machine guns sprayed the ad
vancing lines, the charging Germans
resohed the western and northwest
ern edges of Douaumont fort and
osme to grips with the French de
fenders. Groups of men struggled at
such olose quarters that bayonets and
grenades became useless and resort
was had to knives. The opposing ar
tillery meanwhile sent shells shriek
ing over the fart, searching out en
emy reserve*.
Throughout yesterday afternoon
German columns attacked repeatedly
on both sides of the fOrt from the
northern fringe of Caillette wood and
from the ravine north of Thiaumont
farm. At sundown last night the sit
uation was virtually unchanged, the
French maintaining' themselves in
those portions of ths position taken
Monday.
German troops have penetrated

of Verdun, sifter terrific onslaughts

At all othsr points most violent Ger

In making pufelic the offloiii report
on last night's fighting, the war tfftee

the Germans have been attaklng the

more .than three divisions^ (60,000

LONDON, May 24.—The Exchange
Telegraph stated this afternoon that
it has learned on good authority that
Prince Von Bueiow, former ohanoei
(or of the German empire, Is to be
come the Germs ambassador at
Washington. A rearrangement of the
German dlplomalto corps Is to be ef
fected, the Exohange Telegrsph
stated.
The statement of the English news
agency Is thus far uncorroborated
from any other source, though it haa
been rumored several times that Am
bassador Von Bernstorff might bs
oalled home to an Important post.
Diplomats here said that If the re
port is true the sending of Von Bue
iow to Washington, Is another Indica
tion of Germany's plans to move for
an early peace. Von Bueiow*a name
has frequently been oonnected with
peace moves, especially during his
long stay reoently In Switzerland.
Prince Von Bnefow was sent to
Rome as ambassador and assigned ths
task of preventing Italy from Joining
the allies. When Italy declared war
on Austria a year ago, he was re
called to Berlin but shortly afterward
sent to 8wttzer1and where Be spent
several months.
[Swiss reports said Von Bueiow
at the kaiser's request, had purpose
ly held aloof from active participa
tion in govehimental affairs in order
that he might better sery£ Germany
in peace negotiations. A man of
great personal charm, he has always
been considered one of the best dlplo-i
mats in Efurope. So far as is known,
Prince Von Bueiow has made but ope
address on the subject of peace since
the war began. Speaking at Hamburg
more than a year ago, he declared
that Germany would make a conquer
