BRYAN MAY BE
DRY CANDIDATE
Chicago, May 24.If he will con
sent to make the break, William Jen
nings Bryan may be elected as candi
date for president of the Prohibition
party. A recent statement of Mr.
Bryan before the general conference
of the Methodist Episcopal church at
Saratoga Springs, in which he was
quoted as declaring that he had about
reached the point where he could no
longer follow a party which refused
to endorse national prohibition, was
discussed by the Prohibition party
leaders here today. They expressed
the belief that if the Democratic na
tional convention at St. Louis declin
ed to adopt the national prohibition
plank in its platform Mr. Bryan
might consent to be the candidate of
the Prohibition party for president.
The Prohibition national convention
will be held at St. Paul, July 19 to
22, and will be preceded by a rally
in the interest of the movement to
obtain pledges from 5,000,000 citi
zens to vote only for candidates for
public office who favor national pro
hibition. SUBMARINE TO BE USED FROM

New York, May 24.The Evening

Have Big Guns.
Rome, May 24.The Austrians
have transferred to the Italian front
many 381 and 420 millimeter guns.
The latter cannons have been taken
from the battleships which have been
bottled up in the harbor of Pola since
the beginning of the war.
The detonafions of these enormous
cannons seem actually to split the Al
pine peaks, causing frequent aval
anches.
Coni Zugua, a peak 6,000 feet
high, which dominates Roverto and
the Arza valley, is strongly held by
the Italians. In the high plateau of
Arsiero the Austrians occupy only the
peak of Spitz Tonezza, 5,000 feet
high. All the other surrounding
high mountains are in the hands of
the Italians.
The greatest effort is apparently
directed now against the Asiago pla
teau, east of Arsiero, where desperate
fighting is going on.
