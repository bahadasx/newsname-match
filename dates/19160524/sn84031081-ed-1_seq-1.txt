Two distlncl views are held by for
eigners in China, and nre voiced quite
generally by the foreign press. One
view is that Yuan Shl-kal is the sin
gle strong man in China who can
keep peace and order, and must be
held in the presidency at any cost.
This view is held rather generally
by both foreign and Chinese business
men who arc anxious lo keep condi
tions settled so that ordinary com
mercial intercourse will not be in
terfered with.
The other view, which is held
rather generally by returned students
and advanced thinkers among the
Chinese as well as foreigners, is that
Yuan Shl-kal must be ousted at uny
cost, and that the Chinese should not
have a pre-eminently strong man at
the head of the government because
iuuh u. man will Inevitably become a
military despot after Yuan Shl-kai's
style.
Many of the most ardent, support
ers of Yuan Shi-kai are not his per
sonal admirers, but merely accept him
as the one man they believe capable
of maintaining comparative peace In
China. He is also regarded l y most
of bis ardent supporters as the only
man capable of standing resolutely;
against Japanese advances. On the
other hand his detractors say he Is
the man who made It possible for Ja
pan to line up the entente against
China, and dictate Chinese internal
policy In such a way that Japan Is
assuming directorship, with Kuru
fiean approval, over all of China,
rather than over Hie portions which
were formerly lis sphere of influence.
