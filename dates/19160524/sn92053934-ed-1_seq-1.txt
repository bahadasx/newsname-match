Prince von Buelow Reported
on Special Mission to
Washington.
COUNT TO LOSE JOB?
Dispatch Has It That For
mer Chancellor Is to Be
New Ambassador.
London. May 21. (3:.V p. m.l
The Exchange Telegraph company
says it learns from diplomatic
circles that l'rince yon Buelow,
former (lerman chancellor, is pro
ceeding to W ahincrton. charged by
Emieror William with a social
mission.
The Exchange Telegraph company
also fays it understands Prince von
Buelow will become ambassador to the
fnited States. This information is
said to have been obtained from diplo
matic circles in London.
Prince von Buelow, one of the fore
most statesmen of Europe, has been
referred to frequently in the last few
months as the man who might be se
lected by Emperor William to conduct
preliminary peace negotiations, should
they be undertaken.
Late in 1914 the former chancellor
was sent to Rome by the emperor and
succeeded in delaying Italy's declara
tion of war on Austria. He is credited
also with having prevented war be
tween Germany and Italy.
From time to time it has been re
ported that the prince was engaged in
peace negotiations but so far as has
been ascertained these rumors were
. without foundation. '
An order of the day said to have
been issued recently by Field Mar
shal von Hinnenburg to his men on
the Russian front is quoted as fol
lows, in a Central News dispatch from
Basel, Switzerland:
"For some time a rumor has been
spreading among the troops that peace
negotiations are about to begin and
this fact, coupled with the instinct of
self preservation which is constantly
growing, is having a bad effect on the
morale of the men.
"In the name of the emperor I de
clare that there cannot be any ques
tion of peace until we have crossed the
Dvina, Soldiers if you wish peace go
and seek it on the other side of the
Itvina."
Washington Skeptical.
Washington, May 24. State depart
ment officials were skeptical of the
accuracy of the report that Prince von
Buelow- was coming to Washington on
a special mission for Emperor William.
They have received no intimation that
such a visit was in prospect
The German embassy was without
knowledge of any plan to send Prince
von Buelow to the United States.

ment i,f the Illinois Grand Army of
the Republic, a parade consisting
mostly of military and semi-military
organizations, containing nearly five
thou.-and men, marched through the
streets.
Nearly an inch of rain fell previous
to the .starting of the procession but
did not dampen the enthusiasm of the
veterans and the advocates of prepar
edness. Four hundred men, employes
of a local factory, were in the line of
march. Fully 5,000 school children,
each carrying a flag, saw the proces

Brandeis Is
Approved by
Senate Body
Washington, May 24. The sen
ate. judiciary committee voted ten
to eight today to report favorably
to the senate the nomination of
Louis D. Brandeis to be associate
justice of the supreme court. It
was a strict party Tote,
The action of the committee re
mained in doubt up to the time the
vote was taken. Senator Shields,
democrat of Tennessee, arrived in
the capital today just in time to cast
the deciding vote.
Senator f'ummins of Iowa was the
only member of the committee not
present. His vole, however, was re
corded against confirmation.
The vote is one of the final steps
in a contest which started as soon as
the nomination was sent to the senate
by President Wilson Jan. 2S. Weeks !
were spent by a sub-committee taking
testimony regarding charges against
the nominee, formulated by a commit
tee of citizens of Boston. The sub
committee recommended confirmation
by a strict party vote of three to two.
The charge against Mr. Brandeis
was unethical conduct in relation to
several clients and "working under
cover." President A. W. Lawrence j
Lowell of Harvard, headed the com- j
mittee of citizens organized to fight i
confirmation. William H. Taft., Simeon j
E. Baldwin, Francis Rawle, Joseph
H. Choate, Elihu Root, Moorfield
Storey and Peter W. Meldrim, each a
former president of the American
Bar association also opposed confirma
tion. Charles W. Eliot, president emeritus
of Harvard, only a few days ago wrote
a letter to the committee strongly urg
ing confirmation; Secretary of War
Baker appeared on the witness stand
to ask for confirmation in basis of
Mr. Brandeis' efforts to establish so
cial justice and President Wilson re
cently wrote a personal letter to Chair
man Culberson urging confirmation.

THE WAR TODAY
The Germans are throwing all
their resources against Hill .'fill
and Dead Man's Hill on the left
bank of the Mense and Fort Itnua
mont on the right bank in order to
clear the way to Verdun. The
fighting yesterday and last night
is descrihed as a "murderous
strugtrle," thousands of men on
both sides having been mown
down by the curtain of tire. The
advantage seems to be with the
French so far, though their losses
have been on a tremendous scale
and the fighting of unexampled
Tioleneft, even in this region.
All day the tide of war ebbed
and flowed, again and again the
Germans after reducing trenches
to ruins by a deluge of shells,
charged with their infantry only
to be swept bark by a hurricane
of curtain fire from French bat
teries and machine gnns. The
French claim to hate held all the
positions around Fort Douaumont
which they captured from the
Germans Monday.
On the first anniversary of her
entry into the war, Italy finds her
army forced back to the main line
of defenses by the great Austrian
offensive upon Italian soil. Vienna
says that in the retreat from Dor
go, Uie Italians were forced across
the border by the Austrians.
The Russians have drien fhe
Germans across the Voseluhn
rier by a tierce Infantry attack.
In Asiatic Turkey, the Russians
have repulsed the Turks and oc
cupied .Serbrecht on their ad

FRENCH HOLD
LINE AGAINST
ENEMY DRIVE
Deadly Onslaught of Ger
mans at Verdun With
' stood by Defenders.
FIGHTING MURDEROUS
Battle Be'ing Waged With
out Regard to Cost in
Men on Either Side.
Paris, May 24, (1:15 a. m.) A pow
erful offensive was undertaken by the
Germans last night to the east of
Dead Man's Hill on the Verdun front.
The attempt in general was unsuc
cessful, the war office report of this
afternoon says, but after a fierce
hand to hand struggle the attacking
forces made their way into a portion
of the village of Cumieres.
At this point the French are faced
by more than three divisions.
German attacks on Fort Douaumont,
the corner stone of the Verdun de
fenses, are said virtually to have fail
ed. Notwithstanding the determina
tion of their attacks and what is char
acterized as a most reckless expendi
ture of life, the Germans succeeded
only in taking a small part of a trench
west of the fort.
French War Report.
The text of the statement follows:
"In the Champagne district Germans
by the use of gas, endeavored to oc
cupy our lines. Our curtain of fire
threw the enemy back.
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
the Germans undertook last night a
powerful offensive action east of Dead
Man's Hill. After hand-to-hand fight
ing the enemy penetrated, at the cost
ofimportant sacrifices, into the vil
lage of Cumieres. as well as into one
of our trenches immediately west of
this point.
"Recent information sets forth that
the forces employed by the enemy in
the region of Dead Man's Hill since the
21st of May exceed three divisions.
"On the right bank of the river Meuse
there have been preparations on the
part of the artillery and successive at
tacks of great violence. In the region
of Haudromont and at Douaumont, in
spite of ferocious assaults, the enemy
has been successful in securing foot
ing in only a small part of a trench
east, of the fort. This has been accom
plished without counting the cost in
human lives. All endeavors against
our positions west of the fort and upon
the fort itself have been checked by our
fire.
"In the Woevre district there have
been bombardments in the sectors of
Eix and Moulainville."
Battle is Worst in History.
The battle around Verdun continues
to rage with a violence unexampled
even in this region. The Germans are
striving with every resource in their
power to capture Hill No. 304 and
Dead Man's Hill, on the left bank of
the Meuse and to win back the fam
ous Fort Douaumont on the right
bank which was wrested from them
by General Nivelle's brilliantly plan
ned and executed offensive.
Without full possession of the line
from Pepper Hill to Vaux fort the Ger
mans cannot hope to capture Verdun.
Even if they succeeded in taking this
line they could not hold it unless they
were also in possession of Hill No.
304 and Dead Man's Hill, which out
flank the line.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone the German
command has hurled attack after at
tack against Fort Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its on
slaught on the left bank of the river
to prevent the French transferring
any forces to the main scene of attack
Cost in Men Appalling.
All day yesterday the tide of war
ebbed and flowed, inches of ground
being won and lost at an appalling
cost in men. As one French officer
said: "Plots of land come high here.'
Again and again after reducing
trenches to a crumbling heap of ruins
by a deluge of shells, the German in
fantry dashed forward, only to be
caught and swept i.lvay by a hurri
cane of curtain fire Yrom the French
batteries and machine guns.
The conditions of the present war
have transformed the traditional fur
ious courage of the French soldiers in
to an immovable stoicism. Men have
stood their ground manfully in a sit
uation which seemed beyond human
nature to support. When night fell tht
positions on both sides were un
changed. The French held all their
gains while the Germans incurred
fearful losses without getting near to
any decisions. Describing the battle
around Fort Douaumont, one combat
ant said:
Witness Gives Views.
'Tor four miles behind us there
was not a trench or a communica
tion, nothing but shell holes, one with
in another. Every inch of the ground
was plowed up by an expenditure of
ammunition which is inconceivable.
It is the abomination of desolation. Not
for a becond do the guns cease roar
ing or men cease falling. As soon as
a trench is made the shells' begin to
drop and the survivors have to begin

DROP ACTION ON
HERESY CHARGE
General Presbyterial Assembly Warns
ew York Branch Church Tenets
Mnst Be Accepted.
Atlantic City, N. J.. May 24. The
general assembly of the Presbyterian
church in the United States of Amer
ica today adopted without debate a re
port from the committee on bills and
overtures warning the New York and
all other presbyteries that the tenets
of the church must be accepted by
candidates for the ministry before they
should be ordained. This action, it is
believed, ends further discussion in
the present assembly of the alleged
heresy question in which the New
York presbytery and Union Theologi
cal seminary are involved.
The committee had before it more
than two dozen overtures from pres
byteries from many parts of the coun
try dealing with the heresy contro
versy. The one to which serious con
sideration was given by the commit
tee was that from the Cincinnati pres
bytery which proposed that the New
York presbytery be expelled because
it licensed three young men who are
alleged to hold views at variance with
the doctrines of the church.

TEUTS'DOd
NOW CERTAIN
Rome Dispatch Asserts Gi-

i , Way Is El-Fated.
IS THEIR LAST BLOW
Claim Teutonic Allies Are
Making a Final Assault
for Victory.
Rome, May 23, (via Paris,
May 24, 1:30 a. m.) The
Austrian offensive on the
Trentino front and the fu
rious efforts of the Germans
to gain a decision at Verdun
are explained, in a semi-official
statement, as a concert
ed effort on the part of the
central powers to prevent an.
expected simultaneous at
tack by the allies on all
fronts. ;
The central empires,'' says the
statement, "wish to prevent, even
at the cost of enormous sacrifices
of men and material, the allies
from taking the initiative In the
war operations and attacking them
simultaneously on all fronts.
"Germany and Austria aim at
wearing out France and Italy,
counting on the temporary halt in
the Russian operations contin
uing. They hope that when Bus
sis is ready to resume the fight the
other two nations will be so worn
out as to need a rest."
The statement concludes with
an assertion thttt the Anstro-Uer.
man plans must fail as all of the
allies will be able to pass from the
present defensive stage to decis
ive, simultaneous action. This
great joint offensive, it is de
clared, will bring about the down
fall of the Teutonic powers.
News from the front says that the
Austrians are widening the scope of
their offensive with the intention of
preventing the Italians from concen
trating any considerable force of men
and gnns at threatened points. The
Austrians continue to make their prin
cipal effort in the Adige and Sugana
valleys. One of their most important
advances was along the Lessini moun
tains in Italian territory. They were
driven from this district by an Ital
ian counter attack.
Austrian military activity has been
unexpectedly followed by a sudden
slackening which is interpreted in mil
itary circles here as necessary to re
place the Austrian losses and to bring
up fresh troops for a stronger offen
sive. The Austrian commanders evidently
are planning to extend the line of at
tack as large assemblages of reinforce
ments continue to be reported along
the banks of Lake Garda.
"These troops apparently intend to
attempt to invade Italy along the
northern province of Brescia."
