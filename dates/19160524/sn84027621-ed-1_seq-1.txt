FEASTING AND ORATORY
AT FLEMINGTON
Candidates Met the People in One of
the Most Pleasant Events of
the Campaign
ine political meeting and picnic
dinner at Flemington Tuesday was an
event that well deserves to be remem
bered by all who were present.
Flemington seems to be a sort of a
hub to the country surrounding. It
might well be the hub of the universe
to the people who live or have lived
Jhere. A quiet little settlement in the
midst of woods and cornfields, on
ordinary days it seems the incarna
tion of rural peace and beauty. It
was lively with people, autoes and
other vehicles Tuesday, and both
those at home and visitors from afar
fully enjoyed the day.
Flemington is a place where roads
from all parts of Marion, Alachua and
Levy converge, and is almost the cen
ter of the territory the Bloxhamites
tried to take from us last year. After
viewing the country apd the. people,
the Star was more than glad that we
kept them with us. It is a splendid
country and the people are worthy
of it. : T
When the clans; began to gather
Tuesday morning the clouds were
heavy and the showers occasional,
and it looked like the speaking would
have to take place in the church; but
by 11 o'clock the clearing aspect of
the weather encouraged those in
charge to open the - meeting at the
stand built in the grove between the
postoffice- and the church. This grove
is a most pretty., and pleasant place
to gather; the ground is clean and
dry and the towering oaks and pines
give an agreeable shade, , while the
cooling breezes sweep in fromevery
side. . . ' " -
At least three "' hundred people
perhaps more were present, coming
rom Fairfield, Irvine, Geiger, Mcin
tosh and all other neighboring points,
as well as from Ocala. " Dunnellon.
Williston, Micanopy and Jainesville.
Mr. C. : M. Mathews, the efficient
young committeeman of the precinct,
was. entitled by virtue of his office to
preside, but assigned the duty to Mr.
W. H. Anderson, who performed it
most courteously and efficiently. The
candidates spoke their little pieces as
usual, extolling their own virtues
with good-natured little stabs at each
other's failings. Messrs. Light and
Zewadski kept out of each other's
hair arid devoted their time to public
questions, which was an improvement.
Henry Gordon, for the time .being,
ook away Walter Priest's medal for
the shortest speech, and it is difficult
to see how either is going to say any
When the reporter saw the big
crowd gathered he felt a little bit un
comfortable, for he wondered if there
was going to be enough to go around,
but when he saw the table spread he
rebuked himself for his lack of faith'.
There was plenty for all and lots to
carry away. The Star man had trou
ble disposing of his share Mr. A. B.
Dupuis, lately candidate for clerk,
opened the proceedings by handing
him a loaded plate, which was re
plenished by other friends- faster
than it could be emptied. If the din
ner was a fair indication of the con
dition of the country, Flemington is
a land of Canaan.
We have understood that Fleming-
ton is a rallying point for the guard
ians of liberty; if so, they are not as
angry with the Banner and the Star
as reported, or else they are Arabian
in their hospitality. The venerable
editor of the Banner moved around
ike an uncrowned king, the loved and
honored guest of all, while the Star
man, tho far less known, received a
cordial welcome from everyone he
met.
. A large number went out from
Ocala; all greatly enjoyed the day,
and are loud in their praise of the
good looks and hospitality of the
people of Flemington.

its 30th in Ocala. In numbers the

Strenuous Effort Being Made on
the Enterprise
TAYLOR BROTHERS BELIEVE THAT IT IS 0!!E OF THE GREATEST
HEEDS OF
Is Ocala going to have a modern
butchering and packing plant to take
care of the meat production of Mar
ion and adjoining counties? The Tay
for brothers, of the Ocala Manufac
turing company, have been working
strenuously with a view to building a
plant, and will continue to work unti
results are obtained. . "
"It would be. the biggest thing ever
started here," said Mr. John Taylor
his morning in discussing the pro
ject. Ocala's central location, he said
is greatly in favor of the location of
a large packing industry here.' "The
beauty of the thing is that it cannot
be overdone," Mr. Taylor said. "The
demand exceeds the supply."
The Taylor brothers figure it will
cost between $200,000 and $250,00 to
erect the proposed" plant. They want
to form a co-operative company or
stock . company, either one. The
main thing is to get the industry
started. The banks, it is said, will
assist in financing the enterprise, if
sufficient - amount of capital is
raised. Stock raising promises to be
the chief industry of this section of
the state, and at present markets
have to be found elsewhere for
arge part of the production.
This season 307,000 pounds of pork
have been handled in the cold storage
rooms of the Ocala Manufacturing
Company, and last year, 298,000
pounds were handled.' The cold
storage rooms of the company have
capacity for double this amount
oi meat. The meat is stored at a
rate of one cent per pound for each
thirty days, and a half " cent , per
pound for each additional thirty days.
This rate is said to be lower than
those of some of the big storage
plants in Georgia. y

THE CITY
BANQUET
LIT AFFAIR
Number of Former Students of tha
Ocala High School Gathered at
Harrington Tuesday Night
The first annual banquet of the
alumni association of the Ocala high
school, held at the Harrington last
night, was a most enjoyable and bril
liant affair, attended by about forty
former students. The association was
formally organized and new officers
elected. Mr. Robert Anderson Jr. was
chosen president, Miss Adele Bit-,
tinger vice president, Mr. a H. Lloyd
secretary, and Mr. Laurie Izlar, treas
urer. Miss Annie Atkinson, the re
tiring president, acted as toastmaster.
Dinner was served at 8:30 in the
dining room of the hotel. The table
was more than inviting, with the
school colors, gold and black, clusters
of golden flowers, and a big kewpie
in the center wearing cap and gown..
These decorations were done by Miss
es Adele Bittinger and Helen Brown.
The place cards Were miniature diplo
mas done by Mrs. C. R. Kreger and
Miss Marion Dewey. The menu was
as follows:
Queen Olives
Bouillon Sliced Tomatoes
Roast Tennessee Turkey with Sage
Dressing
Aux Petit Pois Steamed Rice
Fruit Salad
Ice Cream and Cake
Demi Tasse
Between the courses toasts were
given. Mr. Robert Anderson Jr. re
sponded first to the toast, "The O. H.
S. Alumni as University Students.
Mr. Anderson was followed by Prof.
Robert Connor, -who responded to the
toast, "The Alumni in Business and
the Professions." Prof. W. H. Cas
sels, the honor guest of the evening,
spoke on the importance of the alum
ni association. A birthday cake with
single candle was on the table.
This was lighted by Mr. Westlaka
Hollinrake of this year's class, who is
jst 16 years of age, and the youngest
graduate in the association. The
significance of the burning candle
was that it should be made bricrht
the coming year, the first of the per
fected association. Mr. Hollinrake ia
lighting it made a wish to the alumni.
Miss Sidney Harold, president of the
1916 class, made another wish. Then
Mr. W. T. Gary, of the class of 1893,
the second oldest class of the high
school, made one.
Some of the older members of the
association had brought diaries, class
pictures and other things that were
reminiscent of the olden days, and
these were greatly enjoyed.
The purpose of the alumni associa
tion is to advance the interest of the
school and to unite the graduates in a
more social way. When the next an
nual banquet it held it is hoped that
the membership will have been large-
y increased.
Among those present last night
were: Mrs. Arthur Clark, Jackson
