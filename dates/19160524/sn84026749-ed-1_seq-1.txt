Dentist Predicted Death of
His Wife's Father.
MRS. WAITE TAKES STAND
Ordered Autopsy as Spon as He
Received Mysterious Wire
From "K. Adams."
NEW YORK, May 24. Dr. Ar
thur Warren Waite told 'Percy
Peck, his brother-in-law, prior to
tho death of John E. Peck, that
the latter was "suffering much
grief over the death of his wife
and might not live long."
Ho also asked the younger Peck
if Mrs. Waite, Peck's sister, could
not have her share of the income
from the estate before John E.
Peck's will was probated.
This was tho testimony of Percy
Peck when called to tho stand to
day in Waite's trial for murder.
Mrs. Clara Peck Waite, wife of
the defendant, followed Peck on
the stand.
Peck testified in a low, Arm
voice. He gave his sister's name
as Clara Louise Peck, omitting
Waite. He said his father's health
was good up to tho time of his
.death. "'
"My father at tho time of his
death was possessed of, consider
able wealth," testified Percy.

"I have known tha defendant alnce
1914, and was present at hli marriage
to mv lister.
"Dr. Waite, talking to me February
10, 1916, said: 'Tour father la Buffering
much from galef over the death of your
mother. Do not be surprised If his life
Is of short duration.'
"March IS. prior to arrival of the body,

Waite accompanied the body to the
depot. I had the body removed to the
undertaking room, and there had Dr.

Clara, his wife, to have the Income
from my father's. estate before the will
was probated.
"I replied that It was not."
Identifies Telegram.
Peck then Identified a telegram he
received March 11, It read:
"Be prepared for turn for worse In
fathers Illness.
"CLARA."
It has been brought out at other
times that Waite sent this telegram
without his wife's knowledge.
A book of John B. Peck's In which
the properties were listed, was In
troduced. Peck then resumed his tes
timony. "At the time of my father's death
his estate In his own right was about
1600,000, and he owned about as much
mora In equity with the estate of his
brother, Thomas," he said.
"My sister's engagement was an
nounced three months before the
wedding; my mother was In favor, my
father was opposed; but to my knowl
edge, never told Dr. Waite of his op
position. After the engagement was
announced. Dr. Waite was warmly
welcomed by the Pecks. At the time
of the wedding verbal agreement was

It Is also pointed out hero that
Italy did not declare war on Germany.

COMMITTEE
TO CONFIRM
IS AS MIST
VOTES
Appointment to Supreme Bench
Practically Assured by Ac
tion, Politicians Say.
SHIELDS CAUSES SURPRISE
Tennessee Senator Returns
Suddenly and Lines Up With
Administration Forces.
Louis D. Brandcls, about.whose con
firmation as Justice of the Supreme
Court a bitter fight has raged for
nearly four months, will be confirmed
by the Senate.
This was practically settled toda'
politicians say, when the Judiciary
Committee, by 10 to 8, n party vote,
ordered a favorablo report on the
nomination.
The favorable vote In committee
was a surprise. Senator Shields of
Tennessee, who had been expected to
oppose Brandels, lined up with the
rest of tho Democrats for confirma
tion. Senator Shields hurried back to
Washington from Tennesseo to voto
and up to the very moment when tho
roll waa called In tho commltteo It
was not known how he would vote.
Others Line Up.
Senators Reed, O'Gorman, and Hoke
Smith, who wore looked on as In
clined against Brandels but wavering,
also lined up for the nomination.
8enator Chilton was authorized to re
port the nomination to tho Senate. Ho
will do so thM afternoon. The tfenatc
will take It up not later than tho tlrst
of next week.
Efforts will bo made by opponents ot
Brandels to hav the nomination con
sidered In open session. These effort
will fall, politicians said today.
The vote In committee today was:
For Brnndels Culberson. Overman
Chilton, O'Oorman. Fletcher. Reed,
Ashurnt. Shields. Walsh and Hoke
Smith. Democrats.
Against Brandels Clark, Nelson, Dll
llnghnm. Sutherland. Brandgee. Borah.
Cummins, Works, Republicans.
Cummins Not Present.
Senator Cummins wos. not it, tho
meeting not havlngJarrivj!d In th city,
but by an orrnngement previously
made, he was recorded against Brandels.
The fact that the Democrats on the
comti.lttee lined up for Brandels, some
of them against their wishes, means
that most of the Democrats in the Sen
ate wll support him.
Pressure from tho White House, and
from various sources is responsible fcr
the lining up of the Democrats In favor
of the nominee. Some of them thought
It bad politics to oppose Brandels.
Indirectly, the relectlon of Rubleo oa
member of the trade commission had
an effoct. Democrat who opposed l'.ub.
lee were not Keen to go on record irn
lredlatcly as also opposing Branded.
Dramatic Intensity.
Sonators on the Judiciary Committee
said after the meeting today that there
was a period of dramatic intensity in
the committeo room when the roll was
called.
Senator Shields hod just returned, un
expectedly to some of the members.
The roll was begun. The Democratlo
Senators were called first.
When the name of Shields was
reached and ho answered "ayo" on the
motion for a favorable report, there
was a gasp of surprise.
Democrats and Republicans alike had
looked for him to vote tho other way.
In that event the committee would
have tied and a report without recom
mendation would havo been made.

In the party with the President and

Grayson also accompanied the Presi

'the ceremony, which will be quite

gathering of relatives and close friends,
will bo solemnized at 4 o'clock this af
ternoon In the chapel ot St. George's
Episcopal Church, with tho Rev. Wil
liam J. Fox, of Philadelphia, as the of
ficiating clergyman.
Waa McAdoo's Best Man.
Dr. Grayson has been present at all
of the White House weddings since
President Wilson was Inaugurated, and
was best man for Secretary McAdoo
when he married Miss Eleanor Wilson.
lie is credited with being the deus ex
machlna who brought the President and
his brido, then Mrs, Norman Gait, to

Medical Corps of the navy, Is deeply
Interested In his profession, and re
cently took a special course along tho
lines in wmen ne is specializing.
He was first detailed to the White
House during the Taft Administration.
Like Miss Gordon, Dr. Grayson Is a
Mrglnlan.
Miss Gordon Is the daughter of the

who made their home m Washington
for many years. Sho grew up here, at
tended the Cathedral School for Girls
and. although never formnllv presented

The friendship which exists 'lotwoen

Have Traveled Together.
They have traveled extensively to

It Is Interesting to"rrcall that ur.
Grayson and Miss Gordon were tho onlv
guests outside tho representatives of
the two families at the marrldge of
the President and Mrs. Oalt.
Tho doctor's admiration and affection
for the lovelv Miss Gordon dates from

WARNING SEMI
Forwards Reports That Upris
ing to Drive Out U. S. Troops
Is Impending.
VILLA TO HEAD ATTACK
All Faotions Sal? to Be Uniting
to Attack American Troops
South of Rio Grande.
Northern Mexico is seething
with preparations for a desperate
effort to drive Pershing's forces
back across the American border.
Official and unofficial reports
reaching Washington today gave
grave cause for alarm.
Coming as a forerunner to tho
new note which Carranza is send
ing here by special messenger on
the question of a withdrawal of
the American forces, these reports
contain signs that indicate that the
Villistas, for vengeance, and the
Carranzistas, for self-preservation,
may get together in a supreme ef
fort to drive the hated "gringoes''
from Mexican soil.
VILLA MEN RECRUITING.
On the heel of an official dispatch
from General Funton telling oX rum
ored effort of propaRandlsta to rtlr up
the peona1 of Maderr against the Ameri
cans, came pre reports from Colum
bus stating that to the south of Persh
ing's gradually withdrawing f prce. VlUa
janoiu ato .recruiting. preparatory to tr" v'l
attack.
Declaring that Villa Is coming back
to lead all Mexico In an attack on tho
Amerlians, tho bandl'a are said to ba
going about among the peons in tho
Paral district filling up their ranks
whero possible by promises of rich loot,
and forcing recalcitrants at the point
oi me gun to join tneir ranKs.
Pershing l reported to have dl
patched scouting parties southward to
verify these reports and gather 5c5ilta
InformaUon as to the Intention of tho
bandits.
Villa himself Is reported In tho
mountains west of Parral. directing
the operations of hla followers.
Whether the agitators at work at
Madera are emissaries of Villa or
Carranza, General Funston was un
able to soy. He reported, however,
the concentration of a large body of
Carranzistas on the left bank ot tho
Pershing expedition.
Do Not Show Optimism.
Army officers by no means share tho
optimistic professions of State De
partment officials that the Carranza
troops are In the field to co-operate
with the American forces In the sup
pression of the bandlta and the pro
tection of the border.
Army reports from the border merely
state that this Is the "ostensible" pur
pose. Contributing his share towards the
apparent effort of the Mexicans to stage
a quarrel, General Gavlra, the Carranza
garrison commander at Juarez has be
gun issuing statements declaring that
complaints were being received that
General Pershing's troops are Intrench
ing themselves In at Namiqulpa and
manifesting evidence of hostility against
the Mexicans.
Heavy concentration ot Carranzlsta
troops In Chihuahua o nthe left flank
ot Pershing's command out of all
proportions to the number neded for
running down the bandits Is again re
ported, and Is causing concern.
Funston Sends Warning
Of Uprising by Peons
COLUMDUS. N. M May M.-Vllla
bandits are recruiting in tho wake of
the withdrawing American forces, ac
cording to Information received here to
day from Pershing's front.
The remnant of the bands dispersed
hy the United States troops are con
scripting peons at gun points, telling
them that Villa Is coming back to lead
them and promising them rich loot,
which they say will be left by tho
Americans on their flight north.
General Pershing has sent several
scouting parties, south of the advanced
base to gather Information as to these
