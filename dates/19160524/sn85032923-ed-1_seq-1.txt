GERMANY HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR FAILURE
OF DUBLIN
REVOLT
Sinn Feiners Said
Victims of Teutons
PLANS AND FUNDS FOR
UNSUCCESSFUL IRISH
REVOLUTION ALLEGED
TO HAVE COME FROM
BERLIN AND AMERICA,
LONDON, May 22. Tnc Sinn
Fein organization was used as a pawn
in the game played by Berlin and ccr
tain Germans and revolutionists in
:mcrica. according to the history of
the uprising as told by the authorities
here.
The failure of the revolt, it is point
cd out, was made doubly sure by the
inability or disinclination on the part
of Germany to carry out important
features at almost the last moment.
The facts given here have been
gathered from authentic . British
sources and arc presented as com
pletely as possible under the censor
ship.
Shortly after the beginning of the
war, certain Irishmen and German
authorities conceived the idea of util
izing the Sinn Fein organization for a
revolt, the Germans being actuated,
of course, by the admittedly legiti
mate purpose of weakening Great
Britain, and the others having na
tional aspirations or, in at least one
case, a desire to obtain revenge tot
alleged political wrongs. '
The Sinn Feiners accepted the plan
and eventually fell victims to a
scheme which was not of their own
making.
Sir Roger Casement, now in Lon
don Tower, awaiting trial on a charge
of treason, went from America to
Christiania late in 1914 under an as
sumed name. He then went to Ber
in.
Coincident with his arrival in Ber
lin certain officials placed their influ
ence and guarantees of assistance
back of an Irish rebellion.
Elaborate plans for furthering a rev
olution were put under way. Ac
cording to the account, Germany
agreed to furnish the money, arms
and men to assist the Sinn Feiners
and, most important of all, is said
to have agreed to an invasion of En
gland which would prevent soldiers
being sent into Ireland by the Brit-
sh war department.
America was made the medium of
communication between llerlin and
Ireland. Certain Irishmen in the
United States enlisted their services
and Captains Boy-Ed and Von Papcn
and then German naval and military
attaches respectively at Washington.
together with numerous others, arc
said to have done their part in fur
thering the plans.
The carrying of funds to Sinn Fein
ers was done largely by the Irish
sympathizers in America.
