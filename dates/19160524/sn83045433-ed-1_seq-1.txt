Another preparedness measure was
added to the administration program yes

man of the House Military Affairs Com

national council of executive information.
The formulation of this plan for the

The bill provides:
"That a Council of Executive Infor

By JOSEPH P. ANN IN.
A violent attack upon the District su
perintendent of insurance, C. F. Nesbit,
and an attempt to strike out the salary
carried for him in the bill, was made
yesterday by Representative Ben John
son, of Kentucky, chairman of the House
District Committee, in the course of the
first day's consideration of the District
appropriation bill.
The motion to strike out Mr. Neqbit's
salary was lost on a rising vote of the'
House in Committee of the Whole. Mr.
Johnson's point of order against the in
crease of $300, carried for the deputy
commissioner, however, was sustained.
Mr. Johnson's opposition to the Increase
was based avowedly upon his antagon
ism to Mr. Neebit.
Charging that Mr. Nesbit had been
largely responsible for the increase in fire
