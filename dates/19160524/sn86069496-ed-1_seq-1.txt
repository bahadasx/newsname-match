COLUMBIA, ADAIR COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24. 1916.
NUMBER 30
AN ADDRESS.
Tt
The Democrats of The
Congressional District
of Kentucky. "
8th
The long, continued control of the
Federal Government by the Republi
can party resulted in the wanton and
unbridled license of the Interests, ac
centuated by "Cannouism, and dually
culminated in the revolt of the Pro
gressive element of that party.,
The entry of the democratic party
into power has been marked by ef
fective and aggressive reforms
achievements in remedfal legislation
that are soon to be judged by the
American people. Among the meas
ures that have been enacted by the
democratic congress during the Wil
son administration and that have
rendered it the best asset of the dem
ocratic party in our state and nation,
are:
(The constitutional amendment pro
viding for the popular election of the
United States Senate, whereby the
people are given control of that body
instead of the trusts and monopolies;
the Federal Reserve Banking Act,
-which took control of credit from
"OToll ct-rani- unH lnHorori it in t.hft hanfis
of the government, to be administer
ed for the benefit of the masses in
, -stead of the classes, the income tax
provisions, whereby some of the bur
dens of taxation are placed on the
ldl rlp.h. comDelline them to bear
their just share of the necessary ex
penses of maintaining the Govern
ment; the Trade Commission, de
signed to regulate and control the
prices cf the necessities of life, the
action" of public utilities, and pre
venting interlocking directorates; the
Agricultural Extension Act, granting
aid through agricultural and me
chanical colleges, to the several states,
by means of field instruction and
demonstration in agriculture and
home economics; the standardizing of
grades of grain; the Federal-Controlled
Warehouses, stabilizing prices,
preventing dumping-of crops during
harvesting season, and consequent de-.j
pressing of prices, and furnishing the
farmer with prime mercantile com
mercial paper, acceptable to the Fed
eral Reserve Board; appropriating
liberal sums for government aid for
improvement of roads; adequate ap
propriations for the eradication of
infections and contagious diseases
among stock; a system of rural cred
its, whereby farmers may secure loans
at lower rates of interest and on more
favorable terms; a Parcels Post that
furnishes the producers the best and
cheapest delivery wagons to the 'larg
est markets at the highest prices; and
rehabilitated merchant marine that
will again place the American flag on
the ocean trade lanes of the world.
The fruition of this legislation is the
most unparalleled prosperity with
which any administration was ever
crowned.
The administration has, so far,
preserved peace with the world, un
der the most exasperating and trying
circumstances. It inherited an un
prepared army and navy from the
Republican party that had been in
almost continuous control of the Fed
eral Government since the Civil war,
both of which it has promptly reor
ganized in accordance with the rea
sonable demands of the situation,
and at the same time-has entered in
fco peace treaties with twenty-six na
tions of the world
As one who has contributed a mod
est share to this program, by re
maining constantly on the job and
consistently aiding In putting
through democratic congresses all
the foregoing wholesome legislation,
1 confidently submit .my candidacy
foiigrebomlnation for representative
fthe Eighth Kentucky district in
the Sixty-Fifth Congress to the dem
ooratlc voters of this district, believ
ing that those who endorse and ap
prove the record as, in part, set out
Tvttl not rebuke those who have con
tSbuted in however slight a degree
ii its accomplishment. My experi
ence, especially, In these critical
tim, should be an(asset rather than
- -a UfCbUity.
I had hoped, in view of the recent
gauil democratic majorities In our
ilntrirf urn state, that, the democrats
sight -prott. by the get-to-gether
MOTfnent now on among the common
enemy to the end that vote losing
'contests within the party might be
avoided, and our state be more cer
tainly placed in the democratic col
umn in the coming November elec
tion, when a most desperate effort
will be made by a reunited political
enemy to capture control 6t the Fed
eral Government
The small democratic majority in
the House necessitates my presence
in Washington as much as possible,
and for the present, I am compelled
to depend upon .my friends to safe
guard my interests in the district.
1 submit my record to you, and shall
cheerfully abide your verdict at the
primary, August 5th, 1916.
Yery Sincerely,
HARVEY HELM.

We now have a plain proposition
no read, no pay, and if the people of
this county let this go they may never
get another chance to secure a rail
road, and certainly not within the
near future: The organization here
tofore created, through its board of di
rectors, failed to secure the building
of the road on the plans outlined, and
through negotiations with the pro
moters nave secured a proposition re
quiring the people to put up" $50,000
and the right of way. A change in
the fornxof subscription is nece33ary
and immediate action is desirable so
that the contract can be closed and
the survey made. This matter .should
have the active and enthusiastic sup
port.of every person in this section
and not permitted to drag. We . are
bound to get up a few more thousand
dollars, and the sooner the better. No
road, no pay, means no loss it suits
us all. Below we give a telegjani con
firming the acceptance of the proposi
tion agreed on by the board of direct
ors and Dr. Hunter.

Closing of the Lindsey-Wilson.
Last Friday night marked the closing
of. the 13th year in the history of the
Lindsey-Wilson Training School. In
many respects this has been the most
successful year of the school since its
establishment. The girl's dormitory
has been full the greater part of the
last session and the new boy's dormi
tory has been crowded with several
rooming in the old buildings, but the
most marked advancement has been
in the number of months that each
pupil has remained in school. The
number in school at commencement
was almost as large as at any time
during the term. The grade record
shows a large per cent, of high grades.
This .success in academic work is due
to several factors. The comfortable
and well regulated quarters of the
students contributed largely to it.
An earnest body of students has been
a dominating influence, and the spirit
of all toward the school has been good
The support of the people of Columbia
in upholding the discipline in so far
as it affected them, has been gratify
ing to the management of the school.
Last Tuesday night was the recital
I of the graduates in music and express
ion. The young ladies, Miss "Virginia
Coffey, who graduated in expression,
and Miss Carrie 'WUIan, who grad
uated in music, rendered a very enter
taining program showing excellent
talent and training. On Thursday
night was the recital of the music aud
expression class. The program was a
credit to all who took part as well as
their teacher Miss Gwendolyn Bay less,
and was enjoyed by one of the. largest
audiences that ever filled the school
building. The following young ladies
took part: Misses Frances Strange,
Mary -Harris, Elizabeth Harris, Max
Ine Moss, Dollie Elliott, Esther Dod
son, Myrtie Morgan, Lucy McFarlaud,
Grace Huffaker, May Feese, Alyce
Canu, Ruba Wagoner, Mary Shelley,
Margie Buster, Clarice Webb and Sal
