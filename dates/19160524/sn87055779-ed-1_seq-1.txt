WASHINGTON. May IK, That
Jcn. Carranza deliberately is trying
to force an open break with the
F'nited States in order to holster up
his fa?t fading prestige is th opin
ion rapidly Krowinp in otlicial circles
here. Ilia latest demand for the im
mediate withdrawal of the American
troops from Mexico as reported from
Mexico City. haa incensed even those
administration othcials who hereto
fore have been tolerant of his atti
tude because they believed it was
jissumed for home consumption. It
is considered likely here that the de
facto government shortly will be in
formed again that while the Fnited
States has no design whatever on
Mexican sovereignty ita first dutvtoi
its citizens is to protect them and
that it must retain a suflicient force
along the border and in northern
Mexico for that purpose until the
Mexican authorities conclusively
lemousirnte that they can handle
the situation.
In the absence of the ofticial tex
from "Varranza which is now en
route to this city. oflUials have re
fused to discus it anywaj. At the
white house it was slated today that
there has been no change whatever
jn the general situation and the
Pershing expedition will remain
where it is "for the present."
Contemplate Attack.
Massing of -i,0(n Mexican forces,
including all branches of the ser
vice, at Mapula. near Chihuahua
" i t y . by fJen. Jacinto Trevino is held
in administration circles, here t be
almost conclusive proof that an at
tack upon the American forces in
that vicinity is contemplated. Cen.
l'unston has I't-en ordered by the
war department immediately to for
ward all available information re
garding the capture of these troops.
Tiie very f;i t that included in their
tanks is declared to be practically all
of the artillery of the Carranza
irmy, admittedly is highly signifi
cant. Officials point out that it is
iid the customary thing to hunt
bandits with artillery. There hardly
is an army officer here who does not
believe that the troop movement is
preparatory to enforcing a demand
for the withdrawal of all American
forces from Mexico.
At the Mexican embassy, however,
p contrary opinion was expressed
today. Officials there insisted that
this movement of Trevlno's was
merely for the purpose of patrolling
oil of northern Chihuahua and Son
era so that the various bandit fac
tions operating in that v icinity can be
fxterminatrd. In this connection it
was stated that (Jen. Ol.regon had
directed these movements in order
to demonstrate conclusively that his
promises to (Ten. Scott that if the
American forces withdrew he would
take steps which would stamp out
till bandit activ it irs along the border,
were made in good faith.

Chief Carranza's demand for the im

troops in Mexico was received with
equanamity on the border today.
The latest note, dispatched to Wash

regarded here as a document writ
ten for "home consumption."
Mexican otli ers in Juarez admit
ted that the reopening of diplomatic
negotiations was unlikely to make
any change In the military situation
In the near future. Fears expressed
at Washington that the sending of

American border was a threatening
movement were decried by Cten.

"The concentration of Mexican

he will arrange transportation for his

We learned the bandits intended
