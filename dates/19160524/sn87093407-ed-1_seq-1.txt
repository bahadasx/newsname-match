Would Cynthia Cirey help her find a home for the baby?
No. she didn't want-Cynthia to give her away. She just want

She would Investigate them herself.

Ami so the two babies were adopted
The man reporter did It on what he calls a "scientific basis."
The mother found new parents for her baby without science,
but with the trust and confidence of "the mother's Intuition."
When It came to the parting of the mothers and their babies,
the scenes were the same.
The methods of finding new parent* for their offspring made no
difference
They cuddled their babies close. They kissed them. And they
wept.

Heard of Him?
SureYouHave
Harold MacGrath is well
known all over the coun
try. He started as a news
paperman. At the age of
28, he got out his first
book, "Arms and the
Woman." It was one of
the "best sellers"—and
MacGrath's novels have
been favorites ever since.
You probably remember
"The Puppet Crown,"
"The Man on the Box."
"Hearts and Masks," "The
Goose Girl." MacGrath
wrote these—and others.
He's also the author of
"Pidgin Island," the novel
a-week which begins in
The Star next Monday
and ends Saturday.
