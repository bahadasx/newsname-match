They were John S. Potter, the under?

body of John K. I'eck for shipment back
to (irand llapids and who, arcordin,'.

he had chosen murder as *. road ta

ly blaekmaileel ?heir way into tha po

fact.
An engaging frankness, scarcely
dominating an obvioua underrurrent o'
nervousness, marked the testimony of
Potter, who is asserted by Waite te
have been the brains a>' the a

Kane, who aeeepted frorn
a roll of b:lls that Pr WalU say*
amounted to $1,000 and buried lh?
money in the trearherous sands e.f !
Island, where $1,200 meltrd mystenous

employcr while on the stand. He wa
very, very frank, weighing each word
so that no little atom of untruth migh*
flide out. and he smiled with each |
answer an apology for the undoubtedly
compromiiing flitoatioB into which h
had wandereel
Fmhalmer a Rabe in Wooda.
Potter was quite sure he had never i
menfoned money to Waite, not even
in the matter of his bill for lefitiflflatfl
?arvieea. Kane, already having admit
ted the recerpt of the roll fiom the
dafandant, had to tell a lonrer story.
As he told it. hil was the part of a

For the defendant. to whoni noth.ng

Thene urre the most sthking stntrmrnts from Mnyor Mitehel '

"Thcrc was a conspiracy in my opinion, on thc part of certain
clergymen and laymen to obstruct the due administration of the laws,
to intcrefere with government?in short, religious interference with the
government of this city, whieh is a thing, I think, contrary to the
genius of American instiutions, because if there is one thing that is a
fundamental of ours in Amcrican life it is that just as we declare that
government shal! not lay its hand upon the altar of the Church. so thc
Church shall not lay its hand upon the altar of government. And let
me say that while I am Mayor rt will not."
"He (Hotchkiss) pointed out to me that there were serious groundi
for the belief that there existed a conspiracy on-the part of certain
priests cf the Catholic Church. Potter. Hebberd and others to pervert
justice and obstruct the due administration of the law . . . teaeh
witnesses what to say on the stand . . prevent other witnesses
from coming on the stand and get them out of the jurisdiction.'
"These were the four crimes whieh it was suspected had been com
mitted by these persons (Father Farrell and other priests. Potter, Heb?
berd, etc), either individually or in concert?perjury. criminal ltbel,
conspiracy to utter a criminal libel, and conspiracy to prevent and ob?

". . . Mr. (Father) Farrell promised to pay $50 to get a wit?

to pay $100 to get a witness out of the jurisdiction."
