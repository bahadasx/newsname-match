Major McLaughlin to Confer Citi
zenship on 82 Red Men
Yankton Red Men Get a
"Boomerang"
Major ,1 times McLaughlin, spoc
inl agent of llio Secretary of the
Interior, was an arrival Saturday
evening, with the patents *'in fee
simple" for eighty-two allottees of
the Cheyenne liiver reservation.
The ceremonies connected with
delivering the. patents were to take
placd at Eagle Butte to-day (Mny
24). Owing to regulations of the
Indian office,the names of the for
tunate allottees could not. he o!
tained for this weeks issue of The
Press, except hy delaying the
printing, consequently we hope to
be able to publish them next week.
Supt. Campbell returned Mon
day from his trip to Montana and
had a part in the "ceremony of
adoption.''5 ..
Opinions are divided as to
whether these allottees are bene
fitted by being thus made full
fledged American citizens. It is
to be admitted that some of them
may go and part with their land
the "first jump out of the box
but on the other hand, wo know
of scores of Indians who have got,
in their allotments, more land than
they are using, or can use. So the
only problem connected with
their relinquishing some of their
land,is, whether they will foolishly
let it go for less than it is really
worth.
The day is past, in this country,
as it is past in Europe, when any
man or company of men can hold
on to the land that they cannot or
do not use. That is one of the de
linite programs of the Socialist,
program, commencing with min
eral and othei non-agricultural
soil. Unconsciously, as it appears
to The Press, the two old parties
are steadily carrying cut a con
siderable part of the Socilaist pro
gram, and for that reason, The
Press says, "The day is past (fee,"
We have not learned how or to
what extent the new made citizens
here are going to appreciate their
"dowry,'* but the story is in cir
culation around the Agency, that,
of the number recently awarded
their patents at the Yankton Ag
ency, when secretary Lane came
all the way out from Washington
to "jolly" them, some three hun
dred in number, it was discovered,
during the progress of the pre
sentation of patents, that one hun
dred had previously sold or alien
ated them. In consequence, this
hundred did not get their patents,
and were informed that they
would have to wait ten years long
er before they could get them.

is in the market for baseball play
ers.
Recruiting officers have been
directed to bend their energies to
ward the securing of first-class
ball players to fill the teams re
presenting the Corps in various
parts of the world.
The Marine Corps teams at
Peking, China, and Managua.
Nicaragua, are considered by
many travelers to be thoroughly
representative American teams of
near big league calibre.
Vol.. XXXIV—No. FOREST CITY, POTTER CO. SO. DAKOTA, MAY 'j+, 191G
"WHILE THE TOWNSITE COM
PANY SLEEPS"
Henry Eidam has been digging
a number of holes around his
home grounds, and on inquiring
if they were for fence-posts, he re
plied "No. they are to plant trees
in next year." This probably
accounts for the many beautiful
forest trees around Henry's res
idence. He is planting roes all
the time, including evergreens,
but has his holes for them dug a
year in advance.
While on the subject, it should
be noted that Mr. Eidam'sgrounds
are becoming quite a Park since
"the bridge" has been removed.
The removal has closed up Miss
ouri avenue, which has the efleet
of 'ippareutly making Mr. Eidam
heir to an extensive piece of city
property, resulting from the in
difference of the townsite com
pany. Hut the company's loss
may perchance be the community's
gain for with Mr. E.'s property
running to the street corner on the
wet, and the travel going in other
directions, everything seems to be
most favorable to the creation of
a beautiful park in the business
district of our city. The soil
seems to lie perfectly adapted to
the growth of forest trees and oth
er foliage.
BARS HIS OWN "BREAD"
One the show places
southern California is
the home of Brewer Busch,
with its "sunken gardens."
It is situated in dry Pasadena, and
what Busch thinks of the baer
business is shown by the energy
with which he combats all efforts
to make it wet. No Anheuser
Busch "liquid bread" saloons in
his town!
FIFTY SEVEN PROHIBITION
VARIETIES
The Union Signal gives a list of
57 dry cities haying a population
of more than 30,000. The three
largest are Seattle, Washington.
330,834 Portland, Ore., 272,833
and Denver, Colo., 250,000, each
of which is proving that prohibit
ion can be enforced in big cities.
An interesting side-light is the
fact that Washington, Oregon anc
Colorado are all woman suffrage
states.

The .voting women present were dis
cussing their ages. and one of the
girls said, "I don't know what it is
about my appeai'iim e. but everybody
always guesses me a lot younger than
I really am."
And another of the girls answered,
oh. so sweetly: "Oh. that's after they
have heard you talk, isn't it, dear?"—

Eugenie and Crinoline.
Empress Eugenie helped to drive
crinoline out of fashion. "In January
1859." writes a chrouiclcr of nineteen!I
century modes, "when crinolines Inn
reached their largfcst circumference
the papers throughout Europe reported
that Empress Eugenie had appeared
at a court ball without a crinoline
Fhis was an event which completely
overshadowed Napoleon's famous New
Year speech to the Austrian ambassa
dor In the autumn of the same year
when limitations were being issued fo
Compiegne. the empress spoke the
word—no crinoline! Shortly afterward
Queen Victoria also abjured the crino
line, and her example was followed by
the empress of Austria."
