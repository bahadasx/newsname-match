> The first test vote between the
Blease and Anti-Blease factions this

the majority report of the credentials

delegation from Beaufort. This report
was adopted by a vote of 265 to

Suffragettes Heard.
When the Convention reconvened
at 4 o'clock and before the credentials
committee reported, on motion
ot State Chairmna Evans the Convention
voted to allow fifteen minutes
for a committee of suffragettes to
present a petition to the Convention.
A committee, consisting of John Gary
Evans, D. S. Henderson, and D. R.
Coker, were appointed to escort the
ladies to the desk, the suffragettes
committee being Mrs. Harriet Powe
Lynch, Mrs. H. V. Murdaugh, Miss
Mary A. Brennen and Mrs. Henry
Martin. They Were received with
cheers. Mrs. Lynch said their reso
lotion asked the Convention for two
things: First, an amendment to the
State Constitution extending the
right of suffrage to women, and, second,
instructing the delegates to St.
Louis to work for incorporation into
the platform of the national Democratic
party a declaration favoring
woman suffrage without regard to a
federal amendment to this end. She
called attention to the close vote in
the House last year on this subject,
and said their petition covered sixteen
yards of paper. She did not
read it, but asked that it be placed
before the proper committee, vhich
was done. She thanked the Corvention
for extending the ladies this
privilege and was cneered.
This is the second time womar suffrage
has been presented to a T emocratic
Convention, the late Mrs. Virginia
D. Young, of Fairfax, having

* T* 1
terence orosen.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 18.?
Two new bishops or the Methodist j
Episcopal church were chosen tonight
by the general conference after
three days of balloting. They are
Dr. Herbert Welch, president of the
Ohio Wesleyan University, Deleware,
Ohio, and Dr. Thomas Nicholson of
New York, secretary of the church
board of education. The election of
Dr. Welch came on the eighth ballot
and that of Dr. Nicholson on the
ninth.
Although the deadlock which has
existed since Tuesday was broken by
the qpWtinn of the two bishops, five
remain to be chosen. Dr. Nicholson
received 553 votes or 21 more than
was necessary for a choice.
Dr. Welch has been president of
Ohio Wesleyan University since 1905.
He succeeds Bishop James W. Bashford,
who was elected to the episcopacy
in 1914. He is 54 years old. .
The Mexico!
70 Y<
At a meeting of the Abbeville
Light Infantry had on the 23rd instant,
with the intent to propose
"proper measures for responding to
the call of Congress upon the country
for volunteers" for the Mexican
war, the following preamble and resolutions
were proposed and adopted:
Whereas, The requisition made by
Gen. Taylor and Gen. Gaines, to meet
the exigencies on the Rio Grande del
Norte, has been promptly answered
and filled by our patriotic fellow citizens
of the South West; And, Whereas,
no scheme for the organization
of the army of fifty thousand volunteers
under the late War Bill, has
been announced, and no plan of campaign
developed or indicated by the
President of the United States, or the
War Department; therefore,
Resolved, That we await further
information to call from the proper
authorities, before taking any active
measures for raising and organizing
volunteers.
Resolved, That the President and
Congress of the U. S., have but responded
to the feelings and acted
out the patriotic views of the counI
Robert A. Coopt
Statemem
Columbia, May 18.?Advocating a
federalized warehouse system and opposing
the State embarking in the
nre insurance business, Solicitor R.
A. Cooper of Laurens last night issued
a lengthy statement outlining his
reasons for entering the gubernatorial
race. The solicitation of friends
supplemented by the support that he
received in his race two years ago,
stated Mr. Cooper, were sufficient
reasons for the announcement of his
candidacy in 1915. Mr. Cooper believes
in a State controlled warehouse
system, but one that closely
co-ordinates with the national banking
system in the guaranteeing of
warehouse receipts. The Laurens
candidate thinks that state rating bureau
should be substituted for the
combination bureau forbidden by the
Laney-Odom act or a one-man judge.
Mr. Cooper's statement follows:
"I have entered the race for gov- (
ernor at the solicitations of numerous
friends in whom I have implicit faith
and confidence. Without these evidences
of friendship and support I
would not be in the race today. However,
the reasons which prompted me
to offer for this high honor two years
ago have reinforced me in my decision
to run again. These I consider
pardonable reasons as they grow out
of the promptings of my heart to be
of service and, at the same time, to
realize the ambition that every true
South Carolinian may well cherish,
to be governor of this great and good
State. If there are those who find
fault with this position, let them
make of it what they may. I stand
upon the right, taught me from child
hood, that any Democrat is privileged
to offer himself as a candidate for
nomination by the party for any office
within the gift of the people. I
"I have never, during the past 16
years of public life/Bbsed my candidacy
for any position on any other
platform than that of my fitness for
public service. I do not expect to
deviate from that course, unless forced
to it by otherq. It Bhall be my
endeavor to condtict my campaign
free from personalities and let the
people of the State decide by their
ballot whom they desire to represent
them in this great office. |
"It is impossible at this time to
predict the issues upon which the
campaigns are decided by issues
which came to the surface during the
last few weeks. However, it is ap
parent to me that thip people will <
want to know our respective positions
upon the warehouse *nd insurance '
situations. I:
"In regard to the former, I will i
3tate that I am in hearty sympathy,1
with the fundamental principles un- i
ierlying the State-controlled ware- j i
house idea. That is; I believe that j
it is within the province of the State
to provide some means which will facilitate
the gradual marketing of
the State's principal product or products,
so that the producers may
realize a fair profit. I believe that
the State warehouse system as now
:onducted is a long step forward in
NEW OUTFIT ARRIVES.
Lexington Dispatch Receive* Machinery
to Replace That Burned.
Lexington , May 19.?The new
printing outfit of the Lexington Dispatch
has arrived and is being installed
by zn exnert from Atlanta. The
entire plant of The Dispatch was destroyed
in the fire some weeks ago.
New presses and all kinds of type are
being put in, and no weekly paper in
the country will have a better outfit
than The Dispatch. Mr. Harman has
leased rooms in the Rauch building,
on east Depot street, and this will be
the permanent home of Lexington's
oldest paper, the proprietor having
decided not to rebuild on the Main
street lot where the paper was formerly
located.

try, in the prompt, bold, and efficient
measures which they have adopted,
in repelling the invasion of our
soil by the Mexican army, and in
maintaining the rights of our citizens
and the dignity of the nation.
Resolved, That in view of the
eventful crisis, we will rest upon our
arms, prepared to respond with alacrity,
to the call of duty and of pa
inousm, ana n neea De, to maintain
with our lives and our fortunes,
the rights and honor of our country.

Thos. Thomson, Sec'y.
We learn that Gen. Bonham_ has
suspended Ms orders for the Kegimental
parades, chiefly to avoid the
expense and inconvenience to which
it would subject the citizens of the
Division, especially as they may be
ordered out shortly by the Governor
of the State; that he recommends to
companies in progress of organization
for the war, to complete their
numbers and tender their services to
the Governor and to the President.?

t for Publication1
this direction, but I am not sufficient- .
ly familiar with the details of its op- 0
eration to say just what changes, if c
any, are needed to make it the effec- v,
tive system that it should be. I will
state, however, that the system is
far from complete until' other cottongrowing
States adopt similar meas- ?
ures to protect its producers. For this *
reason I think that the system should p
ultimately be a federalizde institu- d
tion. Tins question is of sufficient
importance to justify the hope that it
will be considered without regaid to
the personal ambition or political fortune
of any one or group of individ- o
uals. :r'-' : S(
"I think, also, that the State should ii
provide for the inspection of private f<
warehouses, where desired, in order
to strengthen their receipts in the
money markets of the United States.
"Fire insurance in the conduct of g
the business of the country is a ne- g
cessity. It must be furnished either tl
by the State or by;private companies. 0
i do not hesitate to say that [ think
it would be a mistake for the.State to
enter the insurance business. Firfc insurance
companies are organizW pure ?
ly as business enterprises. It is their ?.
purpose to make money-for the stockholders,
as well as to provide insur- M
ance for their customers. It is rea-i o
sonable to assume that such com- "
panies would desire to do business in f
South Carolina, if the business is pro- ?
litable. If, however,, they demand, as.a
oondition precedent totheir ..doing [J
business in the State, that theState
must surrender its rights to-regulate
their business in order to provide protection
for it citizens, an issue is x
made on which .no patriotic' citizen ^
can hesitate to take'a position. If,
on the other hand, the State,' by leg- ?
islative enactment, has -imposed a 0
burden on the insurance companies a
which make it practically impossible P
for them to operate in the Stite, the J
State should not hesitate to modify 1
such enactments so as to do justice to IV
ail parties. I believe, instead of giv- *
ing to one person the right to make *
rates, that such power should be Vest- v
ed in theharids of an impartial board.
I do not think the insurance , compian- 1
ics which left theState had sufficient
cause to do so. ^ey : should have
shown at least a disposition to Continue
business and given the insur- b
ance commissioner a chance todem- p
onstrate whether or not he would ex- j 0
ercise his power under the Laney-M
Odom act in an arbitrary manner. | f
The objection raised against this law ti
in leference to the matter of certain
affidavits is, in my opinion, untenable.
The law is not susceptible of-the construction
given it by the insurance r
companies. j e
'I shall stand this year where I did ^
two years ago in reference to the en- g
forcement of law. No people can ever ^
become really great unless they are a n
law-ubiding and a law enforcing peo- jj
pie. I shall also discuss during thei
campaign the matter of teaching agriculture
in the public schools, rural
credits, etc." ^
