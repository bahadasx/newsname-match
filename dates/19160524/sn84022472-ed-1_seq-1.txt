ADVANCE LIMIT FOR
DEPOSIT OP SAVINGS
Many "Would-Be Depositors
Turned Away Because
They Have Too Much.
It is expected that the local Postal
Savings Dank deposits will lmme
diately Jump to the $1,000,000 mark
as a result of- the important amend
ment tc' the . Postal Savings act Just
approved by President Wilson.. This
amendment advances the deposit with
intorestlim.it from $500 to $1,000, and
eUminated the monthly limit which
has hitherto been $100. Under-the
new plan, it will be possible to deposit
any amount from 10 cents to $1,000
in one day.. -
'". The advancing , of the deposit limit
will be eagerly: taken advantage of
by the large number of depositors in
the. local bank' who have $500 on
deposit and have been unable to add to
it because they were not allowed to
halve more' than that sum in the gov
ernment bank,
Where formerly only $100 would
be accepted from a depositor in, one
day any amount under the $1,000 may
now be taken. Superintendent of
Finance W. T. Meyers, of the .local
postoffice, i said today that this clause
of the amendment would alone have a
great influence in advancing the total
deposit of the Bridgeport office as al
most hourly persons come to the Pos
tal Savings window with sums of $300
or $400 or more which they wish ta
place in safe bank. When told that
only a part of that sum may be de
posited they seldom leave, any.
Incidently, the advancing of ' the
amount which may be deposited, with
the ' suggestion not yet - worked .. out,
but "which probably will soon be ad
ded as another amendment that other
sums without interest may be depos
ited, opens the first wedge in 'the
fight for check accounts,, in the pos
tal savings bank. The check account,
while it is being fought in every pos
sible way, by private bankers, is
bound to come by popular demand.
While the Potal Savings system has
already proved a signal success as is
shown by thai fact that more than
half a million depositors have over
$80,000,000 standing to their credit,
still it has fallen short of meeting the
full demands of the public- because
of - the restrictions which have now
been eliminated. ' Postmaster-Genera
Burleson and Third ' Assistant Postmaster-General
Dockery have been
tireless in their efforts to secure a
modification of the limitations and
the new liberalizing legislation is par
ticularly gratifying to them.
Mrs. Barrett Denies
She Deserted Husband
' The defense 'had its innings today
when ' the trial of the divorce suit,
brought by William J. Barrett of
Stratford against Margaret Barrett of
this city, was resumed before Judge
Curtis in part two of the superior
court. Mrs. Barrett denied the charge
of desertion made by her husband.
Several witnesses also contradicted
the statement made by Barrett that
Mrs. Hennessy, who has the custody
of a minor child, is not a proper per
son to have the responsibility. Mi
chael Lillis and former. Deputy Sheriff
John Williams of Stratford said Mrs.
Hennessy is a good woman. Barrett
alleges his wife left him September 3,

FACTORY WILL BE
BUILT AT ONCE
Foreign Supply Cut Off,
Bridgeporters Will Pro
duce it Here.
War in Europe has been the indirect
cause of the expansion of a number
of Bridgeport industries other than
those that make war munitions and
among them is the Bead Chain Co. of
1,555 State street. The business of this
little industry which was established.
only a short time ago, has now grown
so large that a new factory is needed.
The concern manufactures chains for
electric and gas fixtures.
Recently the firm purchased from
Helen B. Rennell, one of the heirs of
the Barnum estate, the level tract at
State and Mountain Grove streets.
Last night the building commissioners
granted a permit for the erection of a
steel and reinforced concrete building
laCltl 1. 1 J iih JIM, IKBi 1 11)11 1 1 I I Li.LO
street and 60 feet on Mountain Grove
street. The building will be of two
stories and work will commence jas
soon as the contracts are arranged.
It is expected the building will be
ready for occupancy by fall. The
present factory of the concern is on
leased ground at State street and
Bostwlck avenue.
Prior to .the war most of the bead
chains used in electrical and ..gas fix
tures were imported from Europe. The
Increase in cost of tfhese chains due to
the scarcity of brass materials caused
by war and also the danger of diffi
culty of transportation has caused fix
tufe manufacturers to turn to Amer
ican manufacturers .for their supplies
of bead chains. Hence the big in
crease in the business of the Bridge
port firm and . the necessity for. a
larger factory to accommodate the
growing- business.

Refuses Divorce To
Mr. and Mrs. Stevens

ing to a decision handed dpwn today
by Judige Webb of the superior court
He found in favor of Mrs. Stevens on
the Ncharge of desertion made by the
husband and the cross complaint filed
by Mrs. Stevens, in which she alleged
cruelty, was dismissed toy the court.
The Stevens case was heard yester
day. . The husband alleged his wife
deserted him in March, 1912, but as
It was shown that he had lived with
her after that, the charge was
groundless. The court also held
that Mrs. Stevens failed to prove cruel
ty on the part of her. husband. She
declared he Jiad a loathsome disease.
Which he indignantly denied. Th
couple were married in 1904.

A mob of about 400 women

the intersection of Crescent
avenue with sticks, stones, and

Battering down doors to gain'
entrance to all parts of ,the rec

raged through the house.
Father Gaspard Panik, follow-
ing the death of Father
Mathew Jankola, and rector of
the church of the Sacred Heart,
Torrington, was forced,, with,
others in the house, to take re
fuge behind a barricade in an.
upper room of the rectory.
Police finally rescued him,
Father Stephen Krasula of St.
John's Slavish R. C. church,
New York city, and two rela

Misses Ofstrofsky, but, not be
fore both exterior and interior
of the house had been shower
ed with eggs, many of them of
ancient vintage.
; During' the excitement and
wreckage which prevailed for
15 minutes before word of the
trouble was conveyed to the
police, several Sisters of Mercy '
in the parochial school had dif-,
ficulty in restraining their
pupils.',
When rescued from their danger

guests, were taken to the second pre

from the mob of women who sur
rounded the edifice and threatened
his person.
Later he was conveyed to the parish,

for eight years he has been assigned
temporarily to this city.
During the recent illness of Father
Jankola he was sent to this city, by
Bishop John J.' Nilan. Several re
forms were instituted in the financial
conduct of the church, which while,
meeting with the approval of a por
tion of the parish, were resented by
others.
Open hostilities broke out about
two 'weeks ago when a rumor spread
that Father Panik had asked for the
removal of Father Jankola from the
parish house. Though supporters of
Father Panik declare that the sug

treatment for the dying priest, others
were quick to spread the report that
