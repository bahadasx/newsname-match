deM which tho state claims conciu-
siMriv oroves him guilty of the mur

E. Peck of Grand Haplds, Mich., ur,
Arthur Warren Waite, the young
New York dentist, will go on the wit
neiw stand in an effort to save him
elf from death in the electric choir.
This decision was reached tonight by
his counsel at the end of the second
dav of his trial.
rni.. ri.fonrii.nt' most trying ordeal
probably will come tomorrow, when
his wlte. Mrs. Clara Peck Walte her

to be buried In Grand Rapids urging
that an autopsy no neia on im ,

nv. tim first intimation to the
Peck family that there was anything
wrong. It read:
"Suspicion aroused. Demand au
topsy. Examine body. (Signed). K.
Adams." .
It la said the mysterious person is
a woman outside this state and that
she exacted a promise from tho dis
trict attorney not to d'.scloese her real
name until he was ready for her to
testify. ,
Actions Were Queer.
Thus far the only testimony which
in the remotest manner could be re
garded as throwing env light on the

Waite s acthns on the morning of
Mr Peck's dentil were most unusual.
Swlnton said tnat a snort mm i.r.
iouslv while he an1 his mother and
lster were dining in the hotel where
Walte has since admitted he had bis
"studio," he saw Waite with Mrs
llortox Wnite, he added, tried to
avoid them, but seeing that a meet
ing was unavoidable, he (Walte) re
marked that Mrs. Horton was a nurse
who was assisting him In an opera

Another witness was Gustavo f im

which have been revealed in the po

A condition characterized as "ab-

Reason for alarm Is found by the

In its statistical revletv of tho last

"The only successful way of coping

with the avowed purpose of inuking
public telephone conversations over

termination to take the public irild
his confidence and not to appear be

him Into direct and ucrimlnious con
flict with Chairman Thompson.

this commission. Senator Thompson
ordered the room cleared but the
