AUSTRIAN OFFENSIVE
TO PREVENT INITIATIVE
ray associated mm
ROME, May 24.?The Austrian of
fensive on the Trentlno front and the
iflttrlous efforts of the Germane to gain
t decision at Verdun are explained In
a semi-official statement published
ihere as a result of a concerted effort
on the part of the central powers to
prevent an unexpected simultaneous
attack by the Allies on all fronts.
"The contral empires," says the
statement, "wish to pervent. oven at
the cost of enormous sacrifloes of men
'and material, the Allies from talcing
the Initiative in the war operations,
and attacking them simultaneously on
all fronts. Such is the plan of the
central powers as rovealed by tne
great Austrian offensive on the Tren
tlno front, while the Germans are re
viving their offensive against Verdm,
Germany and Austria aim at wearing
out Prance and Italy, counting on the
temporary halt in the Russian opera
tions continuing."

Will Address a Great Rally of
Harrison County Voters
Here Monday Night.
Announcement was made Wednes
day that Judge Ire E. Robinson, of
Grafton, Republican candidate for
governor, will address Harrison coun
ty voters at 8 o'clock Monday night.
May 29, In the court house here.
It is expected that the meeting will
| be the greatest political rally hold
here during the present campaign.
Judge Robinson Is especially popular
In Harrison county and Republican
and other voters are rallying most en
thusiastically to his standard. The
distinguished jurist Is the most pop
ular man in West Virginia with tho
working classes, and especially with
coal miners as a result of his famous
opinion as a member of the state su
preme court In the Kanawha valley
strike troubles a few years ago In
which he upheld the side of the min
ers. He is equally popular with rail
road men as a result of his long res
idence among them at Grafton.
The Judge will present his claims
for the nomination and preach sound
Republican doctrine, and while the
meeting will doubtless mark a
great outpouring of voters who
believe in honest, capable govern
ment, there will hardly be anything
of the spectacular about It, or any
Indulgence in denunciation of citi
zens as marked a previous effort or
two here by those opposed to Judge
Robinson.

Most Remarkable Reception at
Grafton Since the Famous
McGraw Demonstration.
GRAFTON, May 24.?No more rous
ing reception has been given any can
didate In tbe present primary cam
paign In Taylor county than that ac
cordcd William F. Hlte, of Huntington,
candidate tor the Republican nomina
tion (or United States senator to suc
ceed William D. Chilton, Democrat,
during Mr. Hite's visit the last two
days In tbe county.
As a campaigner Mr. Hlte proved
himself a real vote getter. Tbe same
high class business methods which
characterizes the man In bis dally
walks are conspicuous In his campaign
It is evident to all observers that
hlB method of campaign Is based on
tbe aim to get results and he loses no
time in making every minute count
He Is no dreamer but a real worker
and he made bis visit to this county
count.
Railroad men almost to a man met
and talked with Mr. ?Hlte here. Farm
ers by the hundreds came to see him
and they went away satisfied that
Bite is right Business and profes
sional men flocked to him to assure
him of their support. In fact,
he saw and talked to more voters
than any candidate who has visited
Taylor county this year and his visit
was not in vain. There never was
much doubt that he would carry Tay
lor county by a nice majority and now
there Is no doubt at all about It.
The reception held by him at the
Wlllard botel last night, marking the
close of his campaign In this county,
was the most remarkable here since
the "home-coming" of Col. John T. Mc
Graw following the Chilton purchase of
the senatorshlp from him In Charleston
in 1911. It not only greatly pleased
tbe candidate but It convinced the
gTeat throngs attending that they
were In the presence of the man of the
hour in this state and he next United
States senator from West Virginia.

GOVERNOR HATFIELD
STIRS GREAT CROWD
Chief Executive's Presentation

Great Enthusiasm.
IIMCJAL TO THB TIUIHUII
IXXJAjN, May 24.?Speaking beforo a
large and enthusiastic crowd at Logan
Tuesday afternoon and another at
Holden last night Oovernor Hatfield
Invaded the county of his nativity lu
defense of his administration. Hun
dreds of his personal and political
friends, many companions of his child
hood, turned out to wclcomo the chief
executive and voice their approval of
his official record. The ovation given
him was remarkable. It demonstrated
that while the sun Is setting on bis
administration his influence Is in no
sense on the wane, and his hold on the
confidence and affection of the people
Is as strong today as It ever was. Thq
speaker bad littlo to say about the
contest boing "Waged for the Republi
can nomination for governor, confining
himself almost exclusively to a review
of his achievements while in office.
iHo struck sledge-hammer blows,
however, at his opponents, conspicuous
among whom Is Abe Lilly, candidate
for the gubernatorial nomination, de
claring they are trying to discredit him
because he insisted on serving the
people Instead of the greedy corpora
tions.
Quoting figures to show that every
dollar of the million appropriated
by the legislature of 1913 and provided
by the legislature of 191S at the Becond
extra session was exponded for per
manent improvements and additions to
state Institutions the speaker repudi
ated hiB forces who have been charg
ing his administration with extrava
gance. He doclared West Virginia Is
one of the most economically governed
states In the union and cited caseB of
congestion in the state Institutions to
prove the need for the improvements
made. The Insane were compelled to
He In jails because there were no state
funds available to remove them to
hospitals, he declared. Many other
harrowing examples were quoted to
show tho need for the appropriations
which made necessary the fourteen
oent levy for 1915 after all indirect
taxation measures had been defeated.
The govornor said the levy'for this
year would be loss than ten cents and
predicted that It would drop to less
than five cents In 1917. And yet
wo hear offlceseekerB who are willing
to sell their souls, prostitute their
honor and bow down at the feet of
greed and selfishness tor their financial
and political support, hoping thereby
to get Into office talking about extrav
agance, he declarod. Declaring that
he knows of corporations that have
threatened to discharge their employes
If they refuse to vote for their candi
date for governor, the speaker assert
ed that he did not believe the stalwart
mountaineers of West Virginia would
lie supinely down and permit them
selves to be shackled by those plunder
ers who seek to sack the state by plac
ing an executive In the governor's
office that . wonld do. their bidding.
The governor reiterated that he was
not responsible for Judge Robinson's
candidacy and did not tell any state
employes to support him. -He offered
to contribute $1,000 to the campaign
fund of any candidate to prove that he
did.

ATLANTIC OITY, May 24.?The gen
eral assembly of the Presbyterian
church In the United States today
adopted without debate a report from
the committee on bills and overtures
warning the New Tork and all other
Presbyteries that the tenents of the
church must be accepted by candidates
for the ministry before they should be
ordained. This action, It Is believed,
ends further discussion In the present
assembly of the alleged heresy ques
tion In which the New York (Presbytery
and the Union Theological Seminary
are Involved.
The committee bad before it more
than two dozen overtures from Presby
teries from many, parts of the country
deaUng with the heresy controversy.
The one which attracted the most, at
tention and to which serloua considera
tion was given by the committee was
that from the Cincinnati Presbytery
which proposed that the New York
Presbytery be expelled because it li
censed three young men who are al
leged to hold views at variance with
the doctrines of the church;
