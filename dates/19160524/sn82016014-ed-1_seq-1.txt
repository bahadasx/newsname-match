Paris, May 24. The battle around
Verdun continues to rage with a vio
lence unparalleled even in this region.
The Germans are striving- with
every resource to capture Hill Number
30 4 and Iead Man hill on the left
bank of the Meuse and to win back
the famous Fort Douaumor.t on the
riBht bank which was wrested from
them by General Nivelle's brilliantly
planned and executed offensive, with
out full possession of the line from
Pepper Hill to Vaux tort the Germans
cannot hope to get any nearer to tne
capture of Verdun. Uven if they suc
ceeded in taking this line they could
not hold It unless they were also in
possesion of Hill No. 304 and Dead
Man Hill which outflank the line.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone the German
command has hurled attack after at
tack asainst Fort Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its onslaught
on the left bank of the river to pre
vent the Frnch transferring any forces

Murder Trial.
Sixth Venire Today Is Mostly
City Residents.
Waukegan May 24. The sixth
venire summoned for examination as
jurors in the case of Will Orpet,
charged wifi the murder of Marian
Iambert, appeared in court today.
Most of the 636 men examined so far
have been residents of rural com
munities and practically all have se
cured release from jury duty by pro
fessing a fixed opinion or by failure to
pass a so-called educational test. The
new venire was drawn from residents
of the city. Bankers, merchants, pro
fessional men and other more or less
prominent persons were in the new
venire. Four men already have been
sworn for jury duty and the prosecu
tion today probably will tender to the
defense four more already tentatively
accepted.
State's Attorney Ralph Dady denied
he had the bottle which contained the
poison which killed Marian Lambert.

"I feel that it is my duty to the
people to let them know just how the
tax account of these two corporations
stand and the resolution I am about
to introduce will be broad enough to
make the investigation both thorough
and searching."
"Will the accountants be given full
instructions to date their investiga
tion from the beginning, or will it
cover a certain period of years?" he
was asked.
"It will be a rigid investigation,"

MAY RUN BRYAN
Prohibitionists Want Him for
.Presidential Candidate.
Ford Might Support Him With
His Bank Roll.
Chicago, 111., May 24. National
prohibition party headquarters in Chi
cago became active today in a move
ment to adopt William Jennings Bry
an as the candidate of the party for
president. This movement was due
to Mr. Bryan's declaration at Sara
toga Springs that if his own party
failed to recognize in its platform the
vital issue of prohibition he might
make his battle elsewhere.
The report that Bryan would be a
candidate for president on a third
ticket disturbed some Democratic poli
ticians considerably. The stcry circu
lated among them was that Bryan
was being put forward as a candi
date on a combined pacifist and pro
hibition platform and that Henry
Ford would lend the movement his
influence and bank roll.
The Prohibition party's convention
will be held in St. Paul on July 18.
Until Bryan's name was injected the
most discussed candidate for the
nomination was former Governor Sul
zer of New Tork.

PLAN F0R PEACE
President Believes It's Time to
Consider War's End.
U. S.
Should Be Ready to Act
at Proper Moment.
Washington, May 24. Prospects of
peace in Europe were discussed at the
cabinet meeting Tuesday. Considera
tion also was given to the address the
president will deliver on Saturday be
fore the League of Enforced Peace.
The president's views as he will out
line them Saturday are expected to be:
It is not too early to consider
the part that the United States
will take in ending the war.
The attitude of the belligerents
now indicates that the initiative
toward definite peace negotiations
must be taken by a neutral nation
or nations.
Preparations for peace negotia
tions may well be undertaken a
year before any armistice so there
shall be no delay.
Neutral nations should be
prompt to seize any opportunity
that may pave the way to peace.
No Overtures Made.
If the president has any intimations
from the belligerent nations as to pos
sible peace terms or any suggestions
from them that the United States re
new the tender of friendly offices they
are closely guarded.
Much credence is given to the sup
position that the president and the
pope have an understanding as to pos
sible co-operation or influence when
the day of peace arrives.
