to leave to avoid a quarrel with
the clansman.
"Allen struck me," said Mc?
Craw, "and wo clinched. 1
broke loose. Mr. A)Ion grabbed
me again and struck me over
the bead. I thought at the

tol, lie pushed hid back over
a trunk and was crouching
above me. 1 thought he was:
going to try to kill me, and
drew my gun and shot, lie
fell oir to one side. 1 stumbled
across the room and my guii
was accidentally discharged. I
thought I hail fired bill one shot
at Mr. Allen but I mils! have
tired three, became when I
looked at my gun laier throe
cartridges had been discharg?
ed."

Not Salivate.
Kvory druggist in town?yorr
druggist and every body's drug?
gist has noticed a great falling
oil' in the sale of calomel. They
all give tlit! same reason. Hud?
son's Liver Tone is taking its
place.
"Culomcd is dangerous and
people know it, while liodson's
Liver Tone is perfectly safe and
gives hotter results," said n
prominent local druggist, hod
son's Liver Tone is personally
guaranteed by every druggist
who sells it. A large bottle
cost 50 cents, and if it fails to
give easy relief in every case of
liver sluggishness and const ipa
lion, you have only to ask for
your money back.
Dodson's Liver Tone is pleas
int-tasling, purely vegetable
remedy, harmless to both chil?
dren and adults. Take a spoon?
ful at night and wake up feel?
ing tine; no biliousness, sick
Itendnohe, acid stomach or con?
stipated bowels, It doesn't
gripe or cause incdhvonience all
the next day like violent calo?
mel. Take a dose of calomel
today and tomorrow you will
fetd weak, siclc and nauseated.
Don't lose a day's work! Take
Dodson's Liver Tone instead
ami feel lino, full of vigor and
