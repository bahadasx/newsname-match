Flames Rage in the Lower
Levels of Yellow Jacket,
Famous in Bonanza Days.
Virginia City. Nev, May 24. At least
four men have perished in a fire rag
ing today in the lower levels of the
Yellow Jacket mine near here. Two
bodies have been recovered. The fire
started Tuesday night.
The Yellow Jacket mine Is one of the
famous Comstock lode properties, rich
in the bonanza days. Its production of
gold has fallen off in later years and
now it is flooded with water up to the
1608 foot IeveL It has produced about
S25.0O0.v90 in ores and is owned by E.
B. .St urge, of Scranton. Pa, head of
the Yellow Jacket Gold Mining com

San Francisco. Calif, May 24. At the
San Francisco offices of the company
it was stated that no definite informa

except that it had started at the ISO
foot level the deepest level at which
operations in the mine are now being
conducted.
The total depth of the mine is some
thing over 2600 feet- A similar con
flagration occurred a year ago with no
casualties.
Mining men. who know the property,
said there was very little timbering ex
cept in the shafts and that exits were
numerous. Most of the mine, they say
was cut from solid rock and the Tire
would have nothing to work on.

Speakers vowed Republicanism of
Texas would never sustain a "traitor."
but when W. H. Atweil. of Dallas, told
of the various possibilities for thr pres
idential nomination, Roosevelt, whom
he described as "a man of iron." was
given most applause.
John W. Philip, of Dallas, predicted
that Texas would have a Repub!'an,
governor inside of ten years, and the
keynote of the entire convention was
a sentiment to organize thoroughly for

president. Eugene Marshall, of Dallas,
was chairman of the convention.
The party's platform condemns the
Democratic administration s foreign
policy, calls for the restoration of pro
tective tariff: denounces "the multipli

socalled "trust and industrial legisla
