COLLEGE CLOSES
SUCCESSFUL YEAR
Twenty Graduate from the Different
Departments in This Historic
Year of Jubilee.
The eighth, school year of North
Star College was brought to an
auspicious close on Tuesday evening
this week, when the Commencement
exercises were held at the college
chapel. A busy week of examina
tions and college doings preceded
this event. The first program was
the Piano and Vocal Recital on
Thursday evening. May 18, given by
the more advanced students of music'.
As the program was published in
full in last week's paper, suffice it
to say that every number, both vocal
and instrumental, was well rendered,
reflecting great credit upon the
youthful musicians as well as their
teachers. It was fully demonstrated
that music occupies a prominent
place at the college and that it is
possible for parents to give their
children a good musical education
right here at home. After the re
cital the College Aid served a deli
cious lunch for a small remuneration.
Class Day Program.
On Saturday, May 20, the Class
Program of the graduating classes
i was held and was an enjoyable
affair. After a piano solo by Hil
dur Ranstrom and prayer by Rev.
David Samson, the welcome greet
ings were extended by Arthur Lin
dahl in well chosen words. Next
^v came well written, yet brief biogra
phies of each graduate, by Miss Ran
strom. This was followed by a song
Aby a college quartet, consisting of
Holmstrom, Lindahl, Pihlstrom and
Mattson. "Class Saying and Idio
syncracies" was the title of a well
prepared humorous paper by Miss
Agnes Peterson. Each member of the
class was fittingly characterized.
Miss Mathilda Haarstad gave the
class prophesy in terms that aroused
much merriment. A vocal solo,
"Spring Time," was nicely rendered
by Miss Maybelle Lundgren. The
Class Will drawn up in proper legal
"^^orm and "witnessed by Taft "and
Roosevelt, was read by M. F. Pihl
strom. A piano duet was rendered
by Misses Judith Porten and Olga
Hermanson.
Prof. C- E. Sjostrand next award
ed Judge Holm's Gold Medal for
proficiency in Penmanship to Leo
nard Morud, honorable mention being
given to Fred Lundberg. There is
always keen rivalry among the stu
dents for this valuable prize. The
many specimens of writing submitted
this year were of such uniform ex
cellence that the judges found great
difficulty in making the award. Good
penmen are turned out by the col
lege.
"Farewell' in tender and appro
priate words was said by Oscar
Satterlund and then Rev. F. N. An
derson closed by pronouncing the
benediction.
Baccalaureate Sermon.
On Sunday evening Rev. F. N. An
derson delivered the baccalaureate
sermon to the graduates at the
Swedish Lutheran church. The ser
mon was a thoughtful effort and
contained much good advice to young
people beginning their career in life,
the central thought being: "Do not
err". Special music was furnished
for the occassian.
Concert by Oratorio Chorus
A sacred concert was given by the
Warren Oratorio Chorus on Monday
evening, when portions of the grand
oratorios "Faith and Praise" by
\West, and "Messiah", by Handel,
were rendered, with Miss Lillie An
derson as director and soprano, Miss
Nora Bakke as contralto, Nels E.
Bystrom as baritone amd Miss Olga
Hermanson as accompanist. That
Warren posseses musical talent of a
high order, and that would be a
credit to a city many times our
size, was proved beyound peradven
ture. The solo parts by Misses
Bakke and Anderson and Mr. By
strom were greatly appreciated. The
thanks of all music lovers are due
to those who took part in the rendi
tion.
Rev.J. M. Persenius, of Grand
Forks, gave an instructive and much
appreciated talk on Church. Music
during an intermission in the pro
gram.
Commencement.
The climax was reached on Tues
day evening this week when the
impressive commencement exercises
were rendered, in the presence of a
large concourse of people, including
parents and friends of the graduates,
many alumni, pastors and delegates
of the Red River "Valley Conference
in session here, and other visitors.
While the processional was render
ed by Miss Hermanson and Miss An
derson, on two pianos, the graduates,
faculty, board of directors, the
speaker of the evening and several
pastors marched in and took seats on
the platform. Then came the open
ing hymn, sung by the audience
followed by the Invocation by Rev.
Albin Larson, of Thief River Falls.
Albert Holmstrom, the salutator
ian, next arose and introduced the
graduating class, his effort being
couched in elegant language and
pleasingly delivered. A piano solo
by Miss Hermanson followed.
The commencement address was
given by Rev. Carl Solomonson, B.
D-, President of Northwestern Col
lege at Fergus Falls, and was an
able and eloquent effort. By citing
historical facts he showed how ideas
sway human action and influence
individuals and nations. Young peo
ple more readily than old take hold
of new ideas and become leaders in
the world's progress. How import
ant then that the young be given the
right environment and a Christian
training that will fit them to lead
humanity upward and onward. Pres
ident Salomonson's address was full
of inspiration for young people and
greatly appreciated by all who heard
him.
A vocal solo was rendered by
Miss Lillie Anderson, after which
Adolph W. Mattson arose and de
livered the valedictory, using the
class motto, "We have Reached the
Foot-hills Yonder are the Mount
ains", as the basis for his remarks.
His effort did him credit and was
well received.
President Sjostrand next addressed
to the twenty graduates a few whole
some and affectionate parting
thoughts that flowed from his heart,
after which he presented to each one
his or her well earned diploma.
Later he announced that Adolph
Mattson had been granted a one
year's honorary scholarship by
Gustavus Adolphus College at St.
Peter, Minn.
A hymn by the audience and the
benediction by Rev. P. G. Carlstedt,
of Kennedy brought to a close one
of the most successful school years
in the history of the college.
The Alumni Banquet.
Immediately after the conclusion
of the commencement exercises, the
alumni had a short business meeting
and then proceeded to the banquet
nail, where a line menu1
was served,
covers being laid for about eighty.
Here a pleasant social hour or two
was spent together recalling old
times an pledging anew their de
votion to alma mater. Miss Miranda
Sandin presided gracefully as the
toast mistress and toasts brilliant
and humorous were responded to by
Gill Lamberson, President of the
Alumni Association, George Magnu
son, now a student at Augustana
College, Rev. M. A. Hemnckson in
behalf of his wife, who is an
alumnus, but was unable to attend,
also by several other alumni and
their guests. The occasion was one
that will long be remembered by all
who were present.
Help Keep Warren Clean
The city has bought six metal
receptacles for waste paper and
placed them on prominent corners
in the city with the urgent request
that all waste paper products be
placed therein instead of being
thrown on the streets. On each
receptacle is printed the words:
Help Keep Warren Clean. The habit
many people have of throwing paper
the streets, must be stopped, as
it makes the city present an untidy
appearance. The part of town near
the post office is often littered with
paper by those who receive mail.
European towns, especially those of
Sweden, are noted for their tidy
appearance. The streets are swept
regularly and no rubbish is ever al
lowed to accumulate. Let Warren
get the reputation of being the
neatest and cleanest little city in the
whole state. Use the receptacles.
Junior and Senior Reception
The junior and senior reception at
the opera house last Thursday was
one of the most enjoyable high
school functions of this year. The
hall was tastefully decorated in the
class colors. After the program a
dainty lunch was served. The pro
gram was as follows:

The pupils are now busy prepar
ing for the state examinations which
begin Friday the twenty-sixth.
Mae Blawd is enjoying a visit
with friends in Fargo, N. D.
The high school base ball team
competed with the Stephen team last
Thursday, the score being one to
three in favor of the visiting team.
The game was a good one and we
were proud of the work done by our
boys. The Stephen team had played
Thief River and the score was one
to fifteen in favor of Stephen. Thief
River, played our team and won by
a score of six to two, so when our
team held Stephen down one to three
we could justly be proud of the
work done. Stephen made one score
in the first and two in the fifth inn
ing, and Warren scored in the last
half of the ninth.
Just think! Only two more hard
weeks left of school, so say the
Juniors.

The English classes appreciated
very much the services of Mrs. Sand
berg, Mrs. Bernard, Mr. Bystrom,
Rev. Samson and Mr. Naeseth as
judges.
The Freshmen English classes also
had some interesting work of var
ious types last week. The special

sisted of debates, recitations, origi
nal stories, talks about other towns
where pupils have lived, a class

From this time hence forth credit
will be given for work done in music
outside of school under competent
instruction. Such work will be cred
ited on High School course to the
extent of not more than one full

such a credit must keep a diary of
time sepnt in practice and must pre
sent to musical instructor of High
School with a statement verifying
the same from the one who is in
position to know that the work has
been done. Thisc musical training
may be either vocal or instrumental.
Any kind of music that is consider
ed educational will be accepted. Such
work will be governed by the same
rule as other home projects. Those
desiring to enroll for the above work
should consult Mr. Mitchell before
the close of the school year.
All those interested in handiciaft
might find something of special in
let f^t in the Manual Training depart
ment of the high shool. You are
iivJted to visit this department a4
any time and inspect the woik that
your boy or some other boy has
done. We have no great quantity of
wo^'k on hand but what is here has
been made by the boy who attaches
his name to it. It has not been
glu^d up and cut in the factory and
then sent here and put together but
has been taken out of common stock
and n^anufactared from the very be
gimrng by him. The instructor has
t&kW precaution to do no part of
any boy's work because that is to be
his' by virtue of the fact that he
made it. We will be glad to see you
3t at. time but 'he boys *ili be

The members of the Junior class

A Faithful Machine.
The engine and generator that was
installed in the city electric light
and power plant 14 years ago and
which has been in constant service
ever since was retired on Monday
this week, the Sheaf plant being the
last one to be supplied with power
from it. Installing the alternating
current made a change necessary.
The old engine will be shipped to
St. Paul, remodeled and installed in
the Ryan hotel, where very likely it
will see many more years of ser
vice.

Marshall county, has filed as a candi

BASE BALL.
Warren Opens Season with a Win.
The first game of the season for
the local ball tossers was played
with the speedy aggregation from
Humbolt on Tuesday evening. Hum
bolt came down loaded with an ex
ceptionally strong line-up but the
superior playing of the Warren
veterans proved to be too big an
undertaking for them. The score
resulted 11 to .6 in favor of the
locals.
Wingfield received for the locals in
his usual big league style, while
Russell on the mound pitched an ex
cellent game.
Better and more complete write
ups of the games will be given in
the Sheaf hereafter when the "cub"
will be on the job covering the
games.
Warren 7 Humbolt 6.
According to a wire received in
this city this evening the Warren
team again downed the Humboldites
in a hot contest played at Emerson,
Manitoba. Today is Queen Victoria
day in Canada and in order to
secure a good ball game as an at
traction at the celebration the Can
adians arranged for a game between
the Warren and Humboldt nines.
Fordville with a strong line-up
will be in the city Friday to meet
the local ball tossers on the home
diamond. The game starts at 6:20
sharp and a fast contest is assured.
Vega Farmers' Club.
The Vega Farmers' Club held
their regular meeting last Saturday
evening, May 20. A very large
crowd was present at this meeting.
There was not very much business
disposed of at this meeting., The
program was opened with a song
by members and visitors, then fol
lowed the roll call and minutes of
last meeting, a lecture by Mr. Ner
aal, a violin solo by Miss Ruth
Holmgren and song by the male
choir.
We feel especially thankful to
Professors Neraal and Ward for
their interesting as well as in
structive lecture on "The Water
Supply on the Farm," and hope
that they can be with us in the near
future.
The next meeting will be held
Saturday evening, June 3.
The racing track at the fair
grounds has been put in first class
shape and the horses are being train
ed for the big races to be held at
the county fair July 3, 4 and 5. Ex
tensive repairs have been made also
on the grand stand, which will be
electrically lighted so as to permit
evening performances to be given.
Everything will be ready on time for
the biggest and best fair in the his
tory of the county.
A generous rain Sunday has ben
efited greatly all seeded grain. Con
siderable corn has already been
planted, but a great deal, besides
oats and barley still remains to be
put into the ground. The weather is
cool, just what the wheat plant needs
to deveolp a strong root system.
