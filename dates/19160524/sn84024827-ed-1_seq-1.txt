(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, May 23. Former

a dinner here tonight, that the United

belligerents for a statement of their
peace terms. Referring to the Presi

he said he was glad to note in it an
intimation of efforts towards peace.
"I read with great satisfaction that

"It is not for this country to sug-

dinner which was given in Mr. Bryan's ;
