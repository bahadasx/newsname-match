More Than 3,000 Delegates Are
Present at Federated Clubs
Convention.
New York, May 23.—The thirleenl.il
biennial convention of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs of Am­
erica opened here today, with 3,000
delegates and alternates present, be­
sides 10,000 visitors, including the
husbands of about 1,000 delegates.
The first general session of the con­
vention will be held tomorrow night,
and by that time it is expected an­
other 1,000 delegates and alternates
will have arrived.
The visitors to the city, have been
escorted to hotels and boarding hous­
es by reception committees, assisted
by iBoy Scouts. Preparations have
been made to entertain many more
delegates than have arrived. A. list
of "don'ts," sent to women's clubs
throughout the country, warning
against possible perils that might be­
set them in' the. metropolis, was cited
today by some members of the local
arrangement as a factor in keeping
down the attendance.
Today was "New Jersey Day," and
immediately after the business meet­
ing, the Doard members, headed by
the' president, Mrs. Percy V. Penny
backer and Mrs. William Jennings
Bryan, accompanied by more than 600
delegates, left inspecial trains for
Orange, N. J., to attend a reception
given by Thomas A. Edison and Mrs.

of her state.
in Bill TO
GO 8EF0DE MESS
Washington, May 23—Consideration
of committee amendments to the
Rivers and Harbors Appropriation
bill was completed today after two
weeks of debate. The only import­
ant change made has been the res­
toration of a |200,0(i0 appropriation
for deepening the East River in New
York," which was put in the House
at the request of the President, and
stricken out 'by the Senate commit­
tee.
Many Senators have amendments,
and Senators Kenyon and Sherman
have shown no signs of abandoning
their fiilibuster, so there is no say­
ing when the final vote will be reach­
ed. Opposition t- the measure was
stimulated today by an announcement
of Senator Taggart, democrat, that
be would not vote for it unless the
143,000,000 total was reduced by $15,
400.000 or f20,0W,MM.

for Bandits/
DELAY IN DISCUSSION
OF WITHDRAWAL
New Note From den. Carran­
za Not Expected "Before
Next Week.
Washington, May 23.—Reports of
both the state and war departments
today further indicated plans of the
Carranza government to vigorously
prosecute pursuit of Chihuahua out­
law bands while the American forces
remain comparatively quiescent.
Closely following news of withdraw­
al from Mexico of the second Ameri­
can punitive expedition, sent from
Hoquiles, Teixas, under Col. Sibley
and Major Langhorne, information
reached the state department that
Gen. Obregon had ordered 50,000
troops to engage in the bandit hunts
in Chihuahua and along the Big Bend
border.
Delay in opening diplomatic discus­
sion over the question of American
troops remaining nin Mexico also was
indicated in official dispatches. State
department, officials said that receipt
of the new note being prepared by
Gen. Carranza was not expected be­
fore next week. It was thought prob­
able that retirement of the Big Bend
expedition to American soil bad pre­
sented a new situation in connection
with representations contemplated in
Gen. Oarranza's new note.
Secretary Baker said tonight that
the Slbley-Langhorne expedition was
not withdrawn upon orders from
Washington.
Whether the' 11! national guards­
men of Texas who refused to be mus­
tered into the federal service shall be
courtmartialed has not. been deter­
mined. 'Judge .Advocate General
Crowder today withdrew an opinion
submitted to Gen. Scott, chief of staff,
which outlines the war department's
'.authority and rules of procedure.
Gen. Crowder desires to consider
whether the new army reorganization
bill will affect, the situation.
Stirring Up Natives.
The Carranza garrison at Madera
is engaged in spreading reports cal­
culated to stir up natives against the
Americans, according to a report re­
ceived here today from that place.
No clashes have been reported, how­
ever, between members of the expe­
dition and any of th Mexicans. Mean­
time, the expedition is quiescent, pa
troling only a limited distance to the
south. (jarranzistas are keeping
aloof from the American detach­
ments.
Thanks the Ladies.
Gen. Pershing, through the press
correspondent, thankpd the American
women who tire' contributing luxuries
to the troops, but' announces that the
men are amply supplied with clothing
and socks, and a further deluge of
candies and delicacies would burden
the army transports.
Deaths Not Confirmed
Reports that Col. Louis Morin, and
Victoriano Poctone, alleged Mexican
outlaws, had been killed by Texas
rangers, 75 miles north of Browns­
ville last night, when the Mexicans
attempted) to escape from custody,
still were without official confirma­
tion late last night.
The sheriff of Kaleberg and Wal
licy counties reported they had not

were turned over to the rangers yes­
terday, prsumably to be brought to

Baptists Have Sharp
Clash Over Attitude of
the Church on Divorce
Minneapolis, iMinn., May 23.—The
divorce question was the subject of
sharp debate today at the session of
the Northern Baptist convention to­
day, but was disposed of by the adop­
tion of resolutions disapproving the
action of ministers who officiate at
the marriage of divorced persons.
The convention, which ocmpleted
its business and adjourned tonight,
one day earlier than planned, also
adopted' resolutions favoring a perma­
nent peace program, freedom of the
press, and recognizing labor's right
-'J&
to organize. Congress was petitioned
in another resolution to pass a liquor
prohibition amendment.
It was only after several proposed
amendments had been voted down
and one accepted that the divorce
resolution was adopted. As offered,
the resolution called for remodeling
of divorce laws, condemnation of the
divorce evil, and denounced ministers
who married persons when divorces
were "not on grounds recognized by
churches." The word, "denounced,"
was stricken out and the word, "dis­
approved," substituted. -a -.-i-. »*.

Heavy Masses of (he German
Troops Thrown Against'
TERRIFIC SLAUGHTER
Italian Troops Continue to Re
treat Before Offensive of
Austrians?
London, May 23.—The Germans
have replied to the terrific French
offensive in the Douaumont region
with assault after assault, and the
deadly combat northeast and north'
west of Verdun is still in progress.
Heavy masses of German troops have
been thrown against the picked
French troops, whose successful at­
tacks won for them, the greater por­
tion of Fort Douaumont and consid­
erable ground adjacent to the fort of
high strategic value.
These newly captured positions the
French have tenaciously held.
Particular mention is made by the
French war office of the maintenance
of the position in Fort Douaumont
conquered by the French, Monday.
Fighting at this point is character
ized by iParis as a "murderous Strug*
gle." lEach attack was preceded by
powerful artillery operations.
'Drove Them Out.
Although they were hard held to
the northeast, the Germans would not
be denied at Lemort Homme, and af­
ter having been mowed down by the
French artillery and marine sunn
with sanguinary losses in fceverajjKAt­
tacks, finally gained ar footltoi in Jt^te
trenches to the west of this much
fought for position. Their tenure in
the trenches was short-lived, howev.
er, for the French in a counter at­
tack immediately drove them out.
Italy's first anniversary of her en­
try into the war found her troops on
at least one sector in southern Tyrol,
forced baok by the great Austrian of­
fensive, on Italian BAiL #nd in general
retirement to .their 'tb&ln-llneH Of de­
fense from the region south of Bofe
reto, to the Val Sugana, southeast of
Trent.
Italians Fall Back.
Rome admits that between the As
tico and B'renta rivers and in the Su­
gana valley, the Italians have fallen
back on !tfteir main lines of defense.
•While Rome asserts thit tbt oper­
ation was carried out in perfect order
after the Italians had repulsed Aus­
trian attacks against the advance
lines, Vienna says that in the retreat
from Bargo the Italians were forced
across the border by the Austrians
that the Austrians have advanced as
far as the head of Lake Garda and
the Saca region is indicated by the
Rome official communication, which
says that Austrian troop assemblages
have been observed in the Riva zone.
London, May 23—Premier Asquith

of Ireland, has been abolished, ac­

Lord Wimbourne, whose resigna­

accepted, will be offered another post
of importance under the government.
The Daily News says that the scheme
for the solution of the Irish problem
is or the Irish leaders to accept fbe
principal of separate parliament for
Ulster and the rest of Ireland after
the end of the war, but until the end
of the war the governmnt is to bo
in the hands of a coalition executive
council, with the officers equally dis­
tributed between the two parties.
