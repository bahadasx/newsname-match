in possession of nearly all of the fort

West of the Mouse the Germans at

According to a semi-official Italian
oxv the purpose of the Germans in
continuing their Verdun campaign
: and the Austrians in pressing an of-
; fenslve against the Italians is to pre-
vent an expected simultaneous attack
J by the entente allies on all fronts.
I Austrian Activtcs Slacken.
Rome, May 2-1, va Paris. 4:10 p. m.
Austrian military activity has been
unexpectedly followed by a sudden
slackening which is interpreted in
military circles here as being neces
sary to replace the Austrian losses
and to bring up fresh troops for a
stronger offensive.
The Austrian commanders evident
ly are planning to extend the line of
attack, as large assemblages of rein
forcements continue to be reported
along the banks of Lake Garda.
These troops apparently intend to
attempt to invade Italy along the
northern province of Brescia.
Paris, May 24, 11:15 a. m. A power
njjyj jofensjvwas undertaken by the
B Germans 'last" nighf Co' "life east' of
Dead Man's hill on the Verdun front.
The attempt in general was unsuc
cesstul, the war office report of this
afternoon says, but after a fierce hand
to hand struggle the attacking forces
J made their way into a portion of the
; village of Cumleres. At this point the
French are faced by more than three
r divisions.
Fierce Attacks Fail.
I General attacks on Fort Douaumont,
; the cornerstone of the Verdun de
i fenses, are said virtually to have
! failed. Notwithstanding the determin
ation of their attacks and what is
characterized as a most reckless ex
' peuditure of life, the Germans suc
9 ceeded only in taking a small part of
M a trench, west of the fort.
M The text of the statement follows:
M "In the Champagne district the
M Germans by the use of gas, endeav
M ored to occupy our lines at a point
.1 west of the bavarian farm. Our fire
m threw the enemy back, to his trenches.
Powerful German Offensive.
'J "On the left bank of the river
m Meuse tho Germans undertook last
M night a powerful offensive action east
!g of Dead Man's hill. After hand to
i hand fighting the enemy penetrated,
at the cost of important sacrifices,
5 into the village of Cumieres, as well
j; as Into one of our.trenches immediate-
ly west of this point.
"Recent information sets forth that
the forest employed by the enemy in
- the region of Dead Man's hill since the
; 2l8t of May exceed three divisions.
Successive Violent Attacks.
; ; "On the right bank of the river
. Meuse there have been preparations
' on the part of the artillery and suc-
' cessive attacks of great violence. In
' the region of Haulromont and at Dou-
I aumont, in spite of ferocious assaults,
the enemy has been successful in se
curing a footing In only a small part
of a trench east of the fort. This has
been accomplished without counting
the cost In human lives. All endeav
1 ors against our positions west of the
I fort and upon the fort itself have

' Berlin, May 24, via London, 4:2G p.
ra. The capture by Thuringian troops
' of tho village of Cumleres, east of

i ers, including eight officers, have been
I taken by the Germans in this opera
1 tion.
The text of the communication says:
"Western theater- Southwest o Gi
venchy strong English forces repeat
edly attacked our new positions. Only
scattered troops were able to pene
trate them. These troops fell in hand-to-hand
combats. In other respects
all their attacks were repulsed with
severe English losses. Small detach
ments met with a similar fate near
Hulluch and Blairville.
"Southeast of Houvront, northwest
of Moulin-Sous-Touvent and north of
Pruhay, weak French attacks failed.
French Meet Repulse.
"East of the Meuse we completely

ern slope of Le Mort Homme.
"Thuringian troops took by storm
the village of Cumieres. Up to the
present more than 300 French includ
ing eight officers have been taken
prisoner.
"The enemy repeated his furious at
tacks in the Douaumont region and
suffered severe losses by our fire
The ground temporarily lost by us was
almost entirely re-captured by our
brave regiments and they made more
than 550 prisoners. The fighting con
tinues, supported by very heavy artil
lery fire from both sides.
"Eastern theater. In the vicinity
of Pulkarn coutheast of Riga we drove
the Russians out of a trench situated
between the Russian lines and our
men. Sixty-eight prisoners fell into
our hands."

GREAT OFFENSIVE
CONCERTED PLAN
Central Empires to Prevent
Simultaneous Action on All
Fronts by Allied Forces
at All Costs.
Rome, May 23, via Paris, May 24,
1:30 a. m. The Austrian offensive on
the Trentino front and the furious ef
forts of the Germans to gain a decision
at Verdun are explained in a semi
official statement published here as
a result of a concerted effort on the
part of the central powers to prevent
an expected simultaneous attack by
the allies on all fronts.
"Tho central powers," says the state
men, "wish to prevent, even at the
cost of enormous sacrifices of men
and material, the allies from taking
the Initiative in the war operations
and attacking them simultaneously on
all fronts. Such are the plans of the
central powers as revealed by the
great Austrian offensive on the Tren
tino front while tho Germans are re
viving their offensive against Verdun.

ing on the temporary halt in the Rus
sian operations continuing. They hope
that when Russia is ready at last to
resume the fight the other two nations
will be so worn out as to need a rest.
This view is confirmed by statements
made by Austrian officers who have
been taken prisoner."
The statement concludes with an as
sertion that the Austro-German plans
must fall as all of the allies will be
able to pass from the present defen
sive stage to decisive, simultaneous
action. This great joint offensive, it
is declared, will bring about the down
fall of the Teutonic powers.
Austrians Widening Lines.
News from the front says that the
Austrians are widening the scope of
their offensive with the intention of
preventing tho Italians from concen
trating any considerable force of men
and guns at threatened points. The
Austrians continue to make their prin
cipal effort in the Adige and Saguna
valleys. One of their most important
advances was along the Lessini moun
tains in Italian territory. They were
driven from this district by an Italian
counter attack.

m John MacNeill, president of the
Sinn Feiners volunteers, has been
found guilty by a court martial of
complicity In the Irish rebellion. His
sentence will be promulgated within

There have been many conflicting
rumors as to the part John MacNeill
played in the recent Irish rebellion,
one report being that he disagreed
with the leaders at the last moment
as to the advisability4 of the uprising,
taking the view that' defeat was in
evitable. He is credited with having
issued a general warning to Sinn Fein
ers against participation in the re
volt, following which, it was said,
MacNeill and several immediate ad
herents went into seclusion outside
of Dublin and took no part in the act
ual rebellion.
John Dillon, In a speech in the
house of commons, said that but for
the action of MacNeill, "who broke
the back of the rebellion, the mili
tary would have been fighting still'
John MacNeill, besides being presi
dent of the Sinn Fein volunteers, was
professor of law in the National uni
versity and was the organizer and
twice president of the Gaelic league.

London, May 24, 3.50 p. m The
Exchange Telegraph company says it
learns from diplomatic circles that
Prince von Buelow, former German
chancellor is proceeding to Washing
ton, charged by Emperor William
with a special mission.
The Exchange Telegraph company
also says It understands Prince von
Buelow will become ambassador to
the United States. This information
is said to have been obtained from
diplomatic circles in London.
Prince von Buelow, one of the fore
most statesmen of Europe, has been
referred to frequently in the last few
months as the man who might be se
lected by Emperor William to conduct
preliminary peace negotiations, should
they be undertaken.
Late in 1914 the former chancellor
was sent to Rome by the emperor
and succeeded in delaying Italy's dec
laration of war on Austria. He is cred
ited also with having prevented war
between Germany and Italy. From
time to time it has been reported that
the prince was engaged in peace ne

Court Decision.
Washington, May 24. A bill to re
cover title to 3,200,000 acres of land
worth more than $30,000,000, granted
to tho Oregon aud California rail
road by the federal government fifty
years ago, was brought up in the

thorize suit against the railroad for
recovery' of funds received for sale
of S00.000 acres of land at more than

sions of the original grant.

ground that an injunction against dis
position of tho lands issued last De
cember 9 by the supreme court of
the United States expires June 9.
The measure is of special interest
to 16.000 persons to whom agents sold
the land fraudulently and who were
deprived of their rights by the su
premo court decision.
The bill would provide for classifi
cation of tho 3,200,000 acres as water
power sites, timber lands and agricul
tural lands, and for sale of timber
tracts, and homesteading of non-timber
tracts, at S2.50 an acre. The de

was these men who found the bodies.
McDonald, who was a pumpman, made
a desperate fight for life. His body
was found far up the joint incline to

Marathon, Tex., May 24. Escorted
by a small detachment of the Eighth
cavalry, Lieutenant Colonel Alvarez,
a leader of the Glenu Springs and
Boquillas raiders will be brought here
today and turned over to the local of
ficials to be taken to Alpine for trial.
Colonel Frederick W. Sibley said this
morning.
Alvarez and two companions sepa
rated themselves from the rest of the
bandits in order to stand guard over
seven Americans captured at the Bo
quillas mine, after they had crossed
the border. The three Mexicans were
overpowered by their captives, led by
Carl Halter, mine superintendent and
were given to tho expeditionary force.
Sibley Talks of Foray.
Speaking of the foray into Mexico,
Colonel Sibley said today:
"I believe that our men have shown
in an unmistakable way that bandits
and murderers cannot operate with
Impunity for long in tho Big Bend
country. Our column was a little
slow in reaching the scene of the
depredations, but once there we lost
no time in finding their 'trail, catch
ing up with them and finally dispers
ing them, which was one object of
the expedition.
Natives Welcome Americans.
Our column was welcomed along
the route by tho natives because the
bandits had covered the same road
in their retreat and had committed
outrages and abuses on the people.
Our coming was a source of great re
lief to them and wo were the recipi
ents of many little homely courtesies
both going in aud coming out. When
wo reached Elpino we found Jesse
Deemor and Monroe Payne in a little
hut The bandits at that time did not
realize anyone was on their trail, es
pecially American soldiers. The
had left Deemer and Payne at this
adobo to go out on another raid on a
nearby ranch and upon their return
wero to resume charge of their pris
oners. You can imagine how sur
prised they were when one of our
detachments caught up with them.
Last night Colonel Sibley received
a telegram from General Funston
complimenting him on the successful
termination of tho campaign.
