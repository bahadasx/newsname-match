which the Crocker millions predomi
nate, are understood to be behind the

his trip Is for a vacation, taken be
tause he has long wanted to come to

. look over the ground with a view to
recommending the erection of a mo
dern hotel built particularly for the
Hawaiian climate, i '
Woods will be accompanied by
Chief of Police White of San Fran
cisco, a warm personal friend. Woods
Is a police commissioner of the Bay
' : City. .
Alva B. Wilson, assistant manager
of the hotel, has fairly definite plans
, In mind for a hotel such as Is said to
be contemplated ' here. It Is under
stood that the St. Francis people had
given some consideration to the Sea
side hotel premises, but the recent
action of the Territorial Hotel Com
pany in getting control here has put
this out . of the question. ' a.
The rumors that have been current
