Germans Hurl Solid Column
Against French Positions -
Tkse Behind Become So
Were Useless and Fisls and
French Hold Positions
Paris, May 24. From Der- g Ian's hill eastward to the
ruins of Fort Douaumont t) a most savage battle in
world's history is raging today
Eighty thousand Germans were sent crashing into the
French positions on Dead Man's hill while two Teuton
brigades rushed repeatedly during the night at the sol
diers of the republic holding Douaumont. Every assault
was a failure.
Fighting in the Douaumont ruins attained its greatest
intensity at noon yeserday. Germans covered all French
trenches from Thiaumont to Douaumont with a steady
artillery fire. Behind great columns of dust, the grey
German lines swept toward the French works. French
machine guns sprayed the charging ranks, but still the
waves of spiked helmets came on and swarmed over the
western and northwestern edges of Douaumont.
Here a bloody struggle began. Man fought against
man, clinging to steep parapets, climbing through narrow
alleys and slashing through dense entanglements of
barbed wire. Bayonets and hand grenades became use
less, so closely were the fighting troopers wedged to
gether. Shoved forward by the press of comrades at
their backs, the Germans battled with fists and stabbed
with knives.
When one such assault was defeated by the French and
its survivors ejected from the works, another was started.
Throughout the day the Germans attacked repeatedly.
There was no change when night came. In spite of this
terrific hammering, French troops retained all positions
taken on Monday. The loss at this point in the first two
days of the desperate fighting is estimated at ten thous
and killed. -
Taris, May 24. Cerman troops have
jicntrateil the village of Cumieres, nine
miles northwest of Verdun, after a se
ries of terrific onslaughts against the
French front west of the river Meuse,
the war office admitted today. The
(lermnns also succeeded in taking a
trench west o'f Cumieres and gaining
footholds iu a few sections of trenches
f ast of Fort Douaumont. At all other
points their most violent attacks on
fioth banks of the river and also la the
Champagne region were defeated.
The Hermans since Sunday, recited
the communique, have been uttacking
the northwestern front of Verdun with
50,000 men. Throughout last night the
battle was waged furiously. Both banks
of the Mouse were assaulted but
French troops stubbornly resisted, in
flicting enormous losses on the enemy.
Hand to hand fighting preceded Ger
man capturo of Cumieres village. On
the Meuse east bank Germans, after ex
tensive artillery preparations, launched
repeated charges against the Hnudro-uiont-Douaumont
front, loBing fear
folly. German firp blotted out French
ti'onches, but the defenders stuck to the
debris iiud battled tho advancing Teu
tons with bayonet, clubbed rifle and
t.m re.
East of Fort Douaumont despite a
deadly fire from machine guns, a few
Oerman detachments streamed through
the French bullets and reached their
objective positions. . West of the fort
ell charges were United. The Germans

Seattle, Wash., May 24. Belief that
Mrs.1 Elois Nelms Dennis, formerly of
Atlanta, Ga., worked as a waitress in
the St. Germain bakery, 409 Tike
streot, Seattle, after sho and her sis
to have been murdered, was exprese-r
today by Mrs. Margaret St. Germain,
proprietor ot the battery and restau
rant. "During the latter part of Juno,
1914," said Mrs. St. Germain today, "a
girl named Nellie worked for us heu.
Three days after she began work a
newspaper printed the pictures of the
missing Nelms sisters. The likeness
was so striking between Nellio and
picture of Mrs. Dennis, that I called
Mrs. F. A. Lacy, then of the Seattle
Employment Agency on the telepho. t
"Mm. Lacy ho'i procured Nellie for
the position in the bakery. She Bnid she
too, had noticed the resemblance and
called my attention to another fact that
clinched my belief.
"Sho told me Nellie had a sister
named Beatrice who was then workine
iu a Third avenue restaurant. The pic-
ture of Beatrice Nejnjs, she said, rescm-1
bled Nellie's sister - even more than
the picture of Mrs. Dennis resembled
Nellie."
Mrs. St. Ofrmain reported the mat
tor to tho detective department, she
said, but no effort to ascertain wheth'

women, was made.
When Mrs. St. fiermnin remarked to
Nellio that she looked like the picture
of Mrs. Dennis, the young woman, who
nswered closely the description of the
missing girl, Nellie is said to have re
plied: "I have heard enough of that.
I don't care to hear more. Please let
tho matter rest."
Neither Mis. Lacy nor Mrs. St. Ger

of the sisters employed here.

TRYING TO FASTEN
E
Principal Evidence Is That No
Clues Are Found Implicat
ing Anyone Else
Portland, Ore., May 24. t'nablo to
find a clue which points to anybody
olse, detectives today began weaving
their circumstantial evidence about
Bonnett Thompson, held in jail at
Hillsboro in connection with the brutal
murder of Mrs. Helen C. Jennings, 10
days ago.
lhe search for the body of Fred Ris
man, tho jitneur who drovo the sup
posed murderer to Mrs. Jennings' home,
was resumed today.
A jitney driver yesterday pointed to
Thompson in a group of other prisonorfc
aim said he was "morally certain"
that Thompson was the man who rode
away with Ristman Monday night, Mny
10. Aiiorner jitney driver who saw
Hustman's passenger was not so post-
ti'e in his identification.
Another bit of evidence nirninst
Thompson is the finding of an under
shirt on his clothos lino with some in
distinct stains on it. Tho stains re
sponded to a crudo blood tost, but a
more exacting chomical tost left some
doubt whether the stains were blood.
Detectives declare these stains cor
respond in size and position to blood
stains found on a torn shirt noar the
scene of tho crime. They are unable
to explain the fact that tho torn and
bloody shirt is two sizes too small for
luompson, however
