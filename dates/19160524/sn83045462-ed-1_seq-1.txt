PARIS. May .>4. 11:15 a.m.?
A powerful offensive was undertaken
by the Germans last night |
to the east of Dead Man hill, on !
the Verdun front. The attempt j
in general was unsuccessful, the i
war office report of this afternoon j
says, but after a fierce handrtohand
struggle the attacking forces
made their way into a portion of
the village of Cumieres. At this
point the French are faced by
more than three divisions.
German attacks on Fort Douaumont.
the corner stone of the
Verdun defenses, are said virtually
to have failed. Notwithstanding
the determination of
their attacks and what is characterized
as a most reckless expenditure
of life the Germans succeeded
only in taking a small part

Most Violent of Battles.
The battle around Verdun continues to
rage with a violence unexampled even
In this region. The Germans are striving
with every resource in their power
to capture hill No. 304 and Dead Man
hill, on the left bank of the Meuse, and
to win back the famous Fort Douaumont
on the. right bank, which was
wrested from them by Gen. Neville's
brilliantly planned and executed offensive.
Without full possession of the line
from Pepper hill to Yaux fort, the Germans
cannot hope to get any nearer to
the capture of Verdun. Even if they
succeeded in taking this line they could
not hold it unless they were also in
possession of hill No. 304 and Dead
Man hill, which outflank the line.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone, the German
command has hurled attack after attack
against Fort Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its onslaught
on the left bank of the river to prevent
the French transferring any forces to
the main scene of attack.
Many Die to Gain Inches.
A11 day yesterday the tide of war
ebbed and flowed, inches of ground
being won and lost at an appalling
cost in men. As one French officer said:
"Plots of land come high here." Again
and again after reducing trenches to
a crumbling heap of ruins by a deluge
of* shells the German infantry dashed
forward only to be caught and swept
away by a hurricane of curtain fire
from the French batteries and machine
guns.
The conditions of the present war
^have transformed the traditional furious
oourago of the French soldiers
Into an Immovable stoicism. Men have
stood their gTound manfully In a situation
which It seemed beyond human
nature to support. When night fell
last night the positions on both sides
were unchanged. The French held
firmly all their gains, while the Germans
Incurred fearful losses without
getting near to any decisions. Describing
the battle around Fort Douaumont,
one oombatant said:
Trenches Are Destroyed.
"For four miles behind ue there was
not a trench or a communication, nothing
but shell holes, one within another.
Every inch of the ground was plowed
up by an expenditure of ammunition
which is inconceivable. In holes made
by flfteen-inch shells you could stable
fifteen horses easily. The few trees
. still standing have been stripped of
their branches and looked like telegraph
poles. It is the abomination of
desolation. Not for a second do the
guns <-ease roaring or men cease falling.
As soon as a trench is made the
shells begin to drop and the survivors
have to begin all over again. Attacks
have become almost impossible, because
in the terrific tornado of artillery
fire the infantry on either side are unable
alike to advance or retreat. Verdun
will certainly not be taken from
this point.
J cannot understand how our men
are able to keep it up. You are ex'tcrminated
in your boots without seeing
the enemy. The terrific noise
leaves us hair stunned. Men look at
each other with bewildered eyes. It
requires a strong effort of the will to
apeak to a comrade."

BY A PARTY VOTE:
Senate Committee ApprovesHis
Nomination for the
Supreme Court.
NO DATE SET FOR VOTE I
ON THE CONFIRMATION,
Opponents Will Make a Vigorous' j
Fight When Final Action Comes
on the Appointment.
. i
The Senate judiciary committee ^
voted 10 to 8 today to report fa- a
vorably to the Senate the nomina- '
tion of Louis D. Brandeis to be c
associate justice of the Supreme a
Court of the L'nited States. It ^
was a strict party vote. s
No plan as to when the nomination i
will be taken up in the Senate has yet (
been formulated. J
The action of the committee remained i
in doubt up to the time the vote was *
taken. Senator Shields, democrat, of
Tennessee, arrived in the capital today
just in time to cast the deciding vote. r
He conferred with Senator Smith of ^
Georgia before poing to the committee t
room, but would not state his decision a
before casting his vote. *

How Committeemen Voted. c
t
Senator Cummins of Jowa was the ^
only member of the committee not S
present. His vote, however, was re- j
corded against confirmation. r
Senators voting for confirmation were i
Culberson, Overman, Chilton. O'Gorman, *
Fletcher, Reed, Ashurst, Shields, Walsh
and Smith of Georgia. t
Senators voting against confirmation ?
were Clark of Wyoming. Nelson, Dil- ?
lingham, Sutherland, Brandegee, Borah,
Cummins and Works. J
The vote is one of the final steps in a
contest which started as soon as the
nomination was sent to the Senate by
President Wilson .January -8. Weeks
were spent by the subcommittee taking
testimony regarding charges
against the nominee formulated by a
committee of citizens of Boston. The
subcommittee recommended confirma- (
tion by a strict party vote of three to ?
two. "
s
Debated Fully in Committee. \
The judiciary committee has debated c
this testimony fully. Doubt existed as r
to the attitude of four democrats? r
Senators Reed, O'Gorman, Smith of c
Georgia and Shields. To win a favor- a
able report it was necessary for all c
democrats to vote for Mr. Brandeis.
It became known last week that Sen- 8
ators Reed O'Gorman and Smith would a
vote for confirmation, but doubt con- t
tinued about Senator Shields' vote.
The charge against Mr. Brandeis was *
unethical conduct in relation to several
clients and "working under cover." 5

On the other hand, Charles W. Eliot. *

Secretary of War Baker appeared on
the witness stand to ask for confirmation
on the basis of Mr. Brandeis' efforts

the reasons for making the
nomination and urging confirmation.

THE FIRST
SENATOR WEEKS !
NOT TOWITHDRAW
Announces Emphatically He
Will Stay in Fight for G. 0. P.
Nomination.
Senator John TV. Weeks of Massa
shusetts today authorized The Star to
say for him emphatically that he has
no Intention of withdrawing: from the
contest for the republican presidential
nomination. He is in the fight, to stay,
md said, moreover, that he expects to
?o into the convention with more votes
it the outset than any other candidate.
This announcement was drawn forth
i>y a demand by the Boston Transcript
that the senator should withdraw in
favor of Justice Hughes. Senator
Weeks is in New York today, but was
reached on the teleephone and had this
to say :
Not to Withdraw, He Says.
"I shall not withdraw my candidacy
for the nomination for the presidency,
rhe suggestion that I should do so Is 1
n line with reports that have^been cir?ulated
upon four or five occasions that :
I intended to step aside. 1
"There was no truth in those reports
ind no foundation for the suggestion '
rtade by the newspaper which is quoted
is d^mandine: mv withdrawal. I will '
have more delegates when the voting
:>eglns than any other candidate, and ,
T expect them to stay with me.*' i
The "Weeks withdrawal" has been 1
i political ghost which has stalked
Lcross the stage from time to time
luring the past two months, and each
lime It was "laid" by the senator refusing
to stay under.
May Be Due to Crane.
It is thought by Massachusetts men
it the Capitol that, this latest recurrence
may have followed the publication
of a report that former Senator
W. Murray Crane was getting weakened
on the Weeks candidacy and
turning to Hughes. No confirmation of
that report, however, has been obtained.
The latest reports from Massachuletts
were that Gov. McCall will be presented
by his friends as a candidate
for the nomination, and it is assumed
here that the McCall and Weeks interests
are clashing at this time.

pany also says it understands
Prince von Buelow will become
ambassador to the United States.
This information is said to have
been obtained from diplomatic
circles in London.
Figures in Peace Rumors.
Prince von Buelow, one of the foremost
statesmen of Europe, has been
referred to frequently in the last few
months as the man who might be selected
by Emperor William to conduct
preliminary peace negotiations, should
they be undertaken. He had been
mentioned in this connection not only
on account of his experience and recognized
ability, but because he has occupied
rather a detached position, so
far as actual conduct of the war is
concerned.
Late in 1914 the former chancellor
was sent to Rome by the emperor, and
succeeded in delaying Italy's declaration
of war 011 Austria. He is credited .
aioA with having prevented war be
tween Germany and Italy. He then
went to Switzerland, the ostensible
reason being the ill health of his wife.
From time to time it has been reported
that the prince was engaged In peace *tal
negotiations, but so far as has been
ascertained these rumors were without
foundation. Several weeks ago the
he was called back to Berlin. wa!

Regarding the report that Count von

he had had no confirmation of the re- ma-f

tion three weeks ago and a week later ?er
came the report that Prince von Bue- try
low was to become secretary of foreign
affairs at Berlin. 1x1
Nothing further has been heard on and
this topic and the ambassador stated ^ne'
that he did not understand in the first wou
place how the prince was to get to this proJ
country and when he arrived what ?
would be his mission, as Germany is r"
not seeking and would not make peace witl
overtures. miS)
<ato+a DAnartment Officials were
frankly skeptical of the accuracy of ven,

NEW YORK, May 24?The
sender of the mysterious "K.

in the case of Dr. Arthur
^Varren Waite, accused of the
murder of his father-in-law, John
E. Peck, millionaire Grand Rapids
drug manufacturer, was identified
is Elizabeth B. Hardwick of
Somerville, N. J., at Waite's
trial today. This was the telegram
sent from New York to
Grand Rapids, urging Percy Peck
to have an autopsy performed on
(lis father's body.
Mrs. Clara Louise Peck Waite
Faced her husband. Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite, in the court for
the ?first time today, when she
took the stand as a witness
against him.
Quietly Enters Court.
Mrs. Waite, dressed in mourning:,
came into the courtroom so quietly that
few observed her as she took a seat
behind the jury box as her brother
Percy Peck, was testifying:.
Dr. Waite, who had been sitting: with
bowed head all the forenoon, looked at
his wife, but she appeared not to se*
him.
Mrs. Waite testified concerning hei
fnthor'R visit from Grand Rapids tc
New York, and said that Waite suggested
that Dr. Albertus A. Moore be
called to see her father.
"We?that is. father. Dr. Waite and
myself ? had planned to go to Hot
Springs on a visit. Father appeared tc
be in very good health." she said.
Probing for Motives.
The trial of Dr. "Waite advanced today
to an exposition of motives supposed
to lie behind the alleged crime
Technical evidence to prove that th
young dentist killed Mr. Peck by
dosing him with arsenic was virtually
finished when court convened this
morning.
To Support the contention that Dr.
Waite committed murder in the hope
r>f gaining possession of the Peck fortune,
and that his character and career
were such as to lend color to this
hypothesis, the district attorney called
to the stand the defendant's wife and
her brother, / Percy Peck, of Grand
Rapids.
Dr. Waite not only made a study of
deadly disease germs with which he
has confessed he killed Mrs. John E.
Peck, but appears to have been a
student of medical books on the uses
of poisonous drugs, according to testimony
introduced today.
John Cunniflf, a special officer attached
to the district attorney's office,
recalled to tne stand, told of having
eceived from Eugene O. Kane, who embalmed
Peck's body, a bottle containng
a sample of the fluid used. Cunniflf
ilso identified several medical books
found in Waite's apartment. One of
them, he said, had been marked at a
passage dealing with arsenic poisoning.
Death Caused by Arsenic.
Dr. Perry Schurtz of Grand Rapids,
Mich., who said he ma'de the autopsy on
Peck's body the day it arrived in Grand
Rapids, following the receipt of the
'K. Adams" telegram, corroborated the
;estimony of other physicians as to the
presence of arsenic in the body and declared
it undoubtedly caused death.
Percy Peck of Grand Rapids, son of
lonn tL.. fecK, lesunea mat February 10
ast Dr. Waite told him that his father
aras getting: along in years and that
Waite would not be surprised if he
lved only a short time. Peck died
darch 12. The witness said that immeliately
after Mr. Peck's funeral Dr.
Waite asked if his wife, Clara Peck
Waite, could obtain the use of her
ihare of the Peck estate before a will
vas probated.
Defense Flans Not Disclosed.
Plans for the defense have not been
llsclosed, but those who attended the
rial yesterday believed they gained an
nkling from the persistence with which
Waite's attorneys developed every bit of
svidence showing that the defendant
ilways had conducted himself as a perlon
of refinement and breeding. An inerence
gained from the cross-examilation
was that one of the forces to
support a plea of insanity would be
hat a man such as Waite was deicribed
could not commit the crime aleged
except under the impulse of a
liseased mind.
It is believed that the defendant's
lounsel will put him on the stand as
>ne of the most important witnesses in
jupport of such a contention.

DEFENSE'S LAWYER
PLACED ON STAND
Frank J. Hogan Tells of Controversy
Between Riggs
Bank and Controller.
CHARLES P. WILLIAMS
ALSO IS A WITNESS
I Reveals Why Lewis Johnson & Co.
j Carried Name of Riggs Con
cern on Their Books.
An important development today
in the trial of past and present
Riggs Bank officials on the
charge of periurv was the placing
on the witness stand by the defense
of Frank J. liogan, counsel
for the defense, for the purpose
of getting before the jury a
number of facts in the case of
which he has personal knowledge,
some of which were ruled out by
the court and some of which
could not be brought out by the
defense while they were exantitiing
previous witnesses.
Mr. Hogan told the jury in complete
details of the beginning of the contro,
versy between John Skelton Williams,
controller of the currency, and the
Riggs National Bank, as well as the
events which led up to the filing of the
injunction suit against the Treasury
officials last year, when the hank
charged that Treasury officials were
trying to wreck the institution. He described
how he and former Senator
Joseph Bailey had decided during the
trial of the injunction proceedings last
year without consulting any of the
Riggs Bank officials to draw the famous
affidavit under which the officials swore
k..t *U.. Knnl- . ,1 ..... ,|nnl In ctnnbe
which affidavit had brought upon the
( heads of the bank officials the government
charge of perjury.
1 Cites Untermeyer Statements.
: He said that last year during the Injunction
proceedings Samuel Untermeyer
of counsel for the government at
that time said during a morning ses
! sion of the court, "We do not claim
} that the bank, as a bank, has been
j speculating." and in the afternoon fol't
i lowing the luncheon recess said, "The
J ltiggs National Bank was an active
trader through the Lewis Johnson Company
even to the extent of short sales."
Mr. Hogan testified that Justice McCoy,
who presided last year in the injunction
case, sat up alertly and asked for
a repetition of that statement, for verification
purposes, and Untermeyer re.
peated it.
"I determined," Mr. Hogan said, "to
file the affidavit after consrultation only
with former Senator Bailey and with!
out consultation with the bank officials."
He then described how he went to
his office and drew the affidavit, only
his stenographer being present.
Good Humor Is Shown.
There was at first a disposition on
the part of the government to object
to Mr. Hogan's statements on the witness
stand. Mr. Fitts, assistant to the
| Attorney General, declaring that much
of what Mr. Hogan was saying was
j "hearsay," but the taking of the evii
dence proceeded with good humor on
| both sides, a general exchange of
amenities occurring when Mr. Archer
i at one point said: "1 like Mr. Stanchfield
so mu< h 1 withdraw my objeci
tion."
Whereupon Mr. Hogan proceeded to
talk directly to the jury, explaining
the ins and outs of the controversy between
John Skelton Williams, the controller
of the currency, and the bank.
Mr. Hogan was examined by Mr.
Stanchfieid. He said he was thirtynine
years old, had lived here for fifteen
years and had been a member of
the bar since October, 1S02. Mr.
Stanchfieid brought out that Mr. Hogan
occupies two chairs at Georgetown
University Law School, in one of which
he lectures to 350 students and in
another 300 students. He said he had
been retained in July, 1914, as counsel
for the Riggs National Bank and personal
counsel for the defendants and
was familiar with the controversy between
John Skelton Williams and the
bank in the most complete details long
before the details of the controversy
became publicly known.
"I was brought into the case," Mr.
Hogan said, "by the late K. Ross Perry,
than whom the District of Columbia
bar never boasted a more eminent
member."
Counsel Has Received No Fee.
Great surprise was occasioned in ths
courtroom when Mr. Hogan testified
that he had not received nor would he
receive $1 by way of retainer's fee
from the Riggs National Bank or Mr.
Glover or the Messrs. Fiather for his
services as counsel in the case. He
swore that he knew he was obliged to
be a witness in the case because of his
intimate personal cojitact with it and
me Qoiuns wiiiun icu uy iu u, una
that it had not been his intention to
take any active part as counsel because
of the fact that it would be
necessary for him to be a witness. He
testified, however, that Mr. Darlington
and other counsel for the defense and
the bank oflicials had insisted that he
take a leading part as counsel in the
conduct of the case.
C. P. Williams Testifies.
Another very Important develop,
ment of the day was the testimony of
Charles P. Williams, who was at one
time a member of the firm of Lewis
Johnson & Co.. and who was subpoenaed
by the government but never
placed on the witness stand by the
district attorney.
Called to the stand today, however,
by the defense, he testified that the account
on the books of Lewis Johnson &
Co. in the name of the Rtgga National
Bank, was conducted in the name of the
bank solely for the convenience of
Lewis Johnson & Co., In the same way
as accounts were carried by the John- .
son firm with all the other national
banks in Washington with which the
firm did business, and that often the
Johnson firm received from the bank
oflicials the names of the customers for
whom stock transactions were mads by
the oflicials.
An interesting lneldent of the day
was testimony to the effect that the
celebrated stock commission account of
the bank was used for the purpose of
making subscriptions to public money-'
raising funda It was brought out that
this stock commission aoeount contributed
the sum of ILOOO toward the fund
raised hers to pay the expenses of In
