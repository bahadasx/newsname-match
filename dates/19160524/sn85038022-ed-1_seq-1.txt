EVENING SESSION
Of High School Thursday Night Mill
Supplant Reception Day.
Instead of the usual Reception Day
exercises at which time wo have been
accustomed to displaying the work of
the High School students, we mado
plana several months ago to hold an
Evonlng Session with the High School
doing their regular work.
Many of our patrons have never
seen a modem High School working
under the departmental plan, others
hnvo a sort of a hazy Impression of
how tho work In conducted, nnd som
few perhaps, have definite notions
but the majority of them aro not fa
miliar with tho management and work
done In our High School. The session
will begin at 7:1C at which time wo
hope to have 200 visiting patrons seat
ed In the auditorium, Promptly at
7:16 the bolls ring and the pupils flic
to the auditorium where the usual
opening exercises aro held. In
minutes the bells will ring for them
to fllo to their rooms where regular
class work will bo conducted for ri
porlod of 40 minutes. Every room will
have large card boards announcing
the work In progress In that particu
lar room. At tho end of 10 minutes
the hells will ring nnd the pupils will
file to their respective class rooms
for another 40 minuto period. All
doors will bo open to tho visitors, nnd
we not only ask but urgently appeal
to you to como and see the work lu
progress. If you aro Interested In
German, go to tho German room
whero the work will be conducted in
that language; It Interested In sewing,
go to the sewing room; typcwrltln,
stenography and other usual High
School activities accordingly.
We hopo to mako further announce
mcntsments In tomorrow's paper.

It Is said that tho only way to get
unythlng done Ib to keep right at it,
so again wo would nBk that tho Hoard

Second street extension, near 'the
sccno of tho recent Ore. Of all the
foul ordors that ever assailed a per

.UjHlery Cnnfrouftt the Ledger Oi'llee
As To Whether We Mean
Ono or Two.
It Is not often that such a perplex
ing question as tho ono that now con
fronts us arises. Wo do know how
ever that ono James Drown, composi
tor and "make-up" mnn on tho Ledger
staff went to Portsmouth Saturday af
ternoon and has become lost, strayed
or stolen presumably thu latter.
Ou Monday morning tho following
telegram was received at this otDco.
"Portsmouth, Ohio, 8:45 a. m., May
22, 1916.
"Mr. Frank Nash, care of tho Ledger
Maysvlllo, Ky.
"Unavoidably dclayod. We will be
home tomorrow. Davis tako care of
my end today.
"DROWN."
A cursory glance did not reveal the
loct that the tolcgram said. "WE will
be home." It was not Until Tuesday
afternoon thnt we discovered tho error
of our way.
The mystery that now confronts us
Is whether the "we" means James
Drown and wife or was merely n slip
of the pen In writing the message
Suspicions that "Jimmy" slipped one
lver on his friends and was married
ure lu tho air and u denial from Mr.
Drown Is the only thing that will
knock thu theory In the head.
Soveral hundred people enjoyed the
excursion from this city to Manches
ter, Ohio, Tuesday night on the steam
