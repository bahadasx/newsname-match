Superiority of Artillery Has Assisted
Teutons in Clearing Away
Fortifications.
Austrian troops continue to reduce
the outer girdle of forts protecting
Arsiero, says a dispatch from the Aus
trian press headquarters Monday The
army of the Austrian crown prlneo is
following up the advantage gained on
Friday, w hen the first breach w as made
in the line to the northwest of the fort,
and which enabled the Austrians to at
tack some of the outer positions east
ward of the place from both the front
and the rear.
Both wings of the crown prince's ar
my also have been going steadily
ahead. The right, or west wing, has
been going forward from the northern
slope of the Col. Santo ridge. It storm
ed Col Santo itself and already is pro
ceeding against Monte I'assubio. The
left wing stormed Saso Alto, the com
manding hill of the Armentara ridge,
thus depriving the Italians of their last
supporting positions on this ridge and
enabling the Austro-llungarians to ad
vance into the Sugano valley and take
Roncegno. The guns already captured
include 15 28-centimeter howitzers.
The Austro-llungarians are battling
against many disadvantages in rough
Alpine territory against strongly forti
fied positions, but thus far they have
defeated their opponents both in the op
en field and in the assaults on the fortifications-
The correspondents declare
that the artillery of the Austro-Hun-garians
has exhibited a marked super
iority over. that of the Italians.
SAVINGS BANKS GAIN $148,665.
Commissioners' Report Shows Increas
ed Assets of $108,330,665.
According to a statement just issu
ed by the Bank Commissioner Frank
C. Williams there has been a decrease
in, the resources of Vermont state
banks between December 31, 1916, and
March 7, 1916, of $172,125.32.
The increase In bank deposits from
January 1, 1916 to March 7 last was
9148.GG5.59. If maintained at this rate
for the year it would amount to about
$900,000, while for the six months per
iod between July 1, 1915, and January
1, 1916, the increase in deposits was
$2008.97, an extremely satisfactory
showlnfc.
The total assets of the state banks
on December 31, 1915, was $108,330,-
605.82 and on March 7, 1916, they were
$108,-158,540.50.
Between July 1 and January 1 last
securities sold in Vermont by invest
ment companies licensed to do busi
ness in the state amounted to $7,715,r.i7.
71. Of this amount the sum of $4,409
781.05 was invested in real estate
mortgages located outside of Vermont
and $1,823,262.92 in municipal bonds.
Commissioner Williams has issued
a namDhlct which contains a list of
railroad bonds which in the opinion
of the commissioner are now legal in
(vestments for Vermont stute banks.
For the six months period ending
January 1, $106,644.27 of railroad
bonds were sold in the state by au
thorized investment companies.
BURLINGTON GRAND LIST
Less, by $1,000,000 Than List of Year
' Ago.
Property values in the city of Burl
lngton subject to taxation will be ap
proximately $1,000,000 less than a year
ago owing to a change of the tax law
enacted by the last Legislature for the
exemption of book accounts.
The city assessors have (lied an al
stract of the grand list with the city
clerk, which shows the total valuation
of property appraised for taxation last
year was $19,627,546 of which $12,510,
291 was reul estate, $5,992,455 personal
property and polls (5474) $1,09,80.
The gain in the grand list over the
previous year was $634,107.
The grand list h year ago was t!to
largest in the history of the city.
The tax rate $2 is also the largest
being a raise of 25 cents over the year
before.
Tho loss of approximately $1,000,000
in property values this year will make
a difference of $20,000 in tax receipts,
cutting off this sum from the city's
revenue.
The assessors say that some firms in
JUirllngtim havo decreased their as
eessable property by $50,000 through
the operation of the new law which
would decrease, their tax by $1,000.

CHEYENNE MAY HOLD BLOW-OUT
In Cel
tion of Fiftieth Anniversary
t tfiunding in 1867.
Two-Ha. 'e ' William E. Hawks,
Bennington's
"r" besides he-
in
interested in-, "-v stampede
which is to be held fi-. lit'ad Bay
the coining August, is also . i communi
cation with a number of representative
citizens of Cheyenne, Wyo., who, at Mr.
Hawks' suggestion made sometime ago,
are considering a celebration of the
fiuth anniversary of the settling of
Cheyenne.
A newspaper clipping from the Chey
enne Leader, received by Mr. Hawks
this week looks as though the old
timers out there would take up with
the idea and get as many of the early
westerners of that section at the gath
ering as are now living and can make
the trip. The city will round out 50
years in the summer of 1917, as the
first log hut was erected in that com
munity of many picturesque vicissi
tudes in July, 1807.
Mr. Hawks' idea was to hold another
reunion after the style of the one last
year at Douglas and get together the
boys of the picturesque west before
the days of barbed-wire and houselots
for another week of sociability before
they cross the Great Divide. They are
passing fast of late and another 10
years will find most of them gone.
Two-liar Seventy probably knows
more of these old timers and is inti
mate with more men who would
make such an affair a success, than
any other man in the east. At pres
ent the affair gives every indication of
materializing and will be one of the
last of its kind which will be attended
by the old wild and wooly stock re
maining from the day of the pioneers.

LARKIN CHOKES OBJECTOR
Leaps from Stage and Attacks New
man at Irish Protest Meeting.
Chicago, May 21-. "Jim" I-arkin,
founder of "tho Irish citizen army,
today leaped anoss the orchestra pit
from the Grand Opera House stage and
attacked Matthew Thomas Newman,
sitting in the fifth row. The disturb
ance occurred at a mass meeting of
protest against the execution of Irish
revolutionists. Dr. K. A. Zurawski of
the Polish Federation was speaking.
When he said, "the English certainly
murdered the Irish in true Russian
style," the majority of those present
applauded wildly.
When the applause subsided a dap
per young man in the audience began
to speak with a broad English accent.
It was Newman.
'I am as good an Irishman as any
here today," he said. "I have lived in
Ireland, and my mother Is from a long
line of Ireland's best. But such bally
bunk makes me ill. I say, why do you
try to put over suc h ridiculous drivel?"
Lai kin. who was sitting far back on
the stage, arose, and, in a frenzy of
anger, ran to the footlights. He
jumped clearing the orchestra pit and

aisle she was recognized as Mrs
Larkin.
'Ho careful what you do to him!
she shouted to her Infuriated husband
"Jim, Jim! Think!"
Larkin seized Newman by tho throat
and choked him until ho gasped for
breath. Then he jerked him out of his
seut and shook him until the offending
one was speechless. After Larkin had
torn Newman's collar away he dragged
him to the entrance of the threat re and
tossed him out into the lobby. Then
the meeting wns resumed.

Killing the Parasites.
The only remedy against the
para-
site pest is spraying.
Apples that have a market value can
not bo raised while these parasites live
in the trees and blight almost every
fruit.
In effective spraying something must
be used that can be sprayed very fine
ly and that will spread covering every
crack and nook of the tree and bark,
else all the scale will not be killed and
failure will result.
There are several preparations for
this purpose. Lime and sulphur, and
soluble oils givo good results; the oil
spreading best. To be effective and
spread evenly and to all parts use ' VI
gallons of water with one part of oil.
This will not injure the tree. Apply
only when the bark of tree is abso
lutely dry so that nothing can prevent
Its spreading evenly.
Use the oil spray late In the fall or in
the spring before the buds have start
ed at all.
In the case of old trees heavily cov
ered with the scale the lime and sul
phur applied in the lull will most ef
fectually kill the scale if applied freely.
Then in the early spring apply the oil
epray. ,
For a safe summer spray use the self
boiling lime and sulphur mixture
brought out by the United States De
partment of Agriculture. There are
other summer sprays but there is dan
ger from their use which is not incur
red by using the above.
Seasons of abundant fungi require
three sprays. The firpt one as soon as
the blossoms fall, again in two weeks,
and the last some weeks later.
Cultivation.
Condition must determine the meth
od of cultivation in an orchard. If pos
sible cue can raise early maturing
crops between the rows, thus insuring
cultivation; if this is done mote fertil
izer must be used to caro for extra
drain on the soil.
Don't prune t he roots in plowing.
the roots are near the surface; place
fertilizers where they will reach the
fine roots which are at the end of the
tiunk roots which are usually in old
trees more-distant from the tree than
one supposes.
Don't plow deeper than four inches.
The harrow will reach well under
trees and leaves a fine mulch if well
cross harrowed.
The crchard drinks far more water
than you imagine and it can get it only
where Its soil Is kept fine so to form a
good mulch.
It is a paying investment to water
the orchard in time of severe drouth.
If trees need water, pull the soil
away from around the roots, give each
tree a pailful, and after it soaks In, re
place the earth. No use to apply wa
ter to the surface of ground around the
tree; do it right, please.
Setting New Orchard.
Ret trees forty by forty feet apart,
filling in between if desired with small
fruit. In this case corn and vegetables
can be raised between the rows, then
ample sun will always be present. sun
on soil nnd roots is vital. This cultiva
tion of the crops will care for the trees
also.
In choosing varitics be governed by
your market. Boston favors red apples
such as Baldwins. Williams Favorite
or Mcintosh Keds. New York uses al
most any winter apple or has a market
for the same. For export to England
a yellow or creamy apple is rnfe.
Set mostly standard w inter apples
such as Greenings, Baldwins, Alcxan
der Wealthy, King, etc. The market
for early apples Is soon overcrowded
and price drops below profitable point
besides these early apples will not
keep any length of time.
Packing for Shipment.
Satisfied customers are your great
est assets, so sort w ith utmost hon
esty into three grades. Any attempt
to force Imperfec t fiult as perfects will
result most disastrously to you
Pack a little more neatly and at
tractlvely than ethers do. Ship Jut us
agreed. Be distinctive, In a class by
yourself when selling ami you can al
ways get the lop notch price and your
crop will be sold in advance.
Your nearness to a good market with
so low freight rates compared with
western growers frees you from all
competition and besides these eastern
markets are also clamoring lor culls at
a prico that will often make your culls
pny your entire expense of harvest
lug. This advantage is not possessed
by western growers.

Bloodiest Battle of Verdun Corn
pap Continues
GERMANS CAPTURE CUMIERES
Paris Reports French to Be Holding
Other Positions Gained on
t
Monday.
Paris, May 24. The Germans pene
trated the village of Cumieres, north
west of Verdun, the war office admitted
today.
Fully 10,000 were killed in the blood
iest battle of the Verdun campaign last
night when the Germans sent 80,000
men against Fort Douaumont and two
more brigades attacked Dead Man hill.
The fighting continues with the great
est violence but the French, according
to the war office report, hold all of the
positions gained on Monday.
London, May 23. As a result of the
dramatic stroke of the French troops
northeast of Verdun yesterday in storm
ing a mile and a quarter of trenches
and gaining a foothold In Fort de Dou
aumont. the conflict along the entire
northern battle line in that region has
assumed a most desperate and sangui-
ary character.
1'hus far, according to Paris accounts
the German assaults last night and to
day have almost -, completely failed,
bile tho French troops havo made
further gains at Fcrt du Douaumont,
and now possess, it is stated, all but
the northeast corner.
The added success at this point was
achieved last night in the midst of a
violent struggle that spread along the
Thiaumont-Douaumont section. The
Germans made repeated attacks en
masse, but only succeeded, according
to Paris, in reocou2)'ing a trench north
of Thiaumont Farm.
Today the combat in this area was re
sinned and became "a murderous strug
gle," as the French official, bulletin
tyles it. Heavy German guns pound
ed the line, and the German infantry at
tacked furiously, but at the end of the
day, so Paris states, the French held
all the positions taken yesterday, "not
ably in Fcrt de Douaumont."
Today Dead Man Hill has been the
arget of the Germans, first using bis
guns, and then hulling great masses of
men at the French position east and
west of the hill. One assault, deliver
ed at 7 o'clock in the evening, reached
French trench, but the assailants
were expelled by a counterattack.

AUSTRIA'S AMBITIOUS PLAN
Hopes to Reach the Adriatic, Says
Diplomat in Washington.
Washington, May 22. Austria's
announcement of successes on the Ty
rolian front were described by diplo
mats friendly to the Central Powers

cal importance. It was stated that tha
drive over the mountainous regions on
tho Tyrol Italian line, being accom
plished under diificult conditions, had
for its ultimate objective the cutting
of the railroads in Venetia, the north
east neck of Italy, and then pressing
on to the Adriatic to cut off a large
number of Italian troops now operat
ing w ithin the neck which is surround
ed on the frontier by Tyrol, Carinthia,
and Goritz.
The Austrian official stntenient of to-
dav indicated that Austrian troops had
already crossed the Italian frontier.
The line between Mount Tormino and
Monte Maio. which is paid to have
been reached by the troops of the Aus
trian Crown Prince would cany the
offensive within Italian territory.
Monte Majo is eighteen kilometers
(eleven miles) southeast of Monte Tor
mino.
The operations against Mandriola
and the heights west to the Astach
niipv niso were retarded as being ot
treat importance. They indicated, the
ditilomnts said, that another large force
of Austrian troops was timing 10 uie

"Other Woman" Also Witness In
Case Against Alleged Poisoner
"K ADAMS" ALSO TO TESTIFY
Woman Who Sent Telegram Which
Started Investigation and Result
ed in Waite's Arrest.
New York, May 23. The stato to-
day finished the technical evidence to
prove that John E. Peck was put to
death by his son-in-law, Dr. Arthur
Warren Waitq. At . adjournment . to
night everything had been made ready
for th day of sensations scheduled to
begin tomorrow morning.
Then tho tall, slender, indifferent
prisoner on trial for his life will find
confronting him first his wife, Clara
P. Waite; after her, Margaret Weaver
llorton, the 'other woman'; Percy Feck
his brother in law; perhaps his aunt in
law, Miss Catharine Peck, and the
mysterious "K. Adams," whose trench
ant telegram to Percy Peck inspired
the investigation which resulted in tho
accusation.
The Identity of "K. Adams" has been
kept a close secret by District Attorney
Swann, because the woman has dread
ed the publicity which would follow the
disclosure of her identity, but after
court tonight it was rumored she will
be found to be a woman member of the
household of Dr. Jacob A. Cornell of
Scmorville, N. J., a lifelong friend of
the Peck family, whose suspicions were
aroused on visits to the Waite apart
ments immediately before and after

arsenic found in his organs after death

HOME OF AN EXTINCT RACE
Leonard Outhwaite Investigates Indian
Mounds on Santa Cruz Island..
Leonard Outhwaite, anthropologist
of the University of California, and
Mrs. Outhwaite have arrived at the
home of Mr. Ouinwaite's mother, Mrs.
P. B. Jennings, aud will make Old Ben
nington their headquarters during tho
sunime.'.
Mr. Outhwaite has recently complet
ed an investigation of the Indian
mounds on the island of Santa t'ruz off
the coast of southern California. The
expedition, which was sent out by the
university, obtained sufficient data to
prove that the Indian population of tho
land at one time was as many as a
thousand persons. The sites of fully
hundred villages were located and a
large amount of information relative to
the the habits of the aborigines was
obtained.
There are about a hundred Indian
mounds' on the island, the largest 130
feet wide and U00 feet long. Excava
tion revealed the presence of great
piles of shells from the shellfish that
plainly constituted the principal living
of the primitive people. With tho
shell were mingled nshes from their
tires, bones of animals and fish and
crude implements and weapons and
even tho hones of the ltid.'ns them
selves. Tho expedition has proved that re
search on tho island will make avail
able to the university a rich fund of
irchaelogical lore on n subject of
which there has been but littlo prcvi-
mis knowledge and the results obtained
by Mr. Outhwaite will undoubtedly
lead to further investigation.
