? ? i' '
(By AfHoclatod Prc.?s)
ROME May 24.?The Austrian ofen
sive on the Trentino front and the
furious efforts of the Germans to gain
a decision at Verdun are explained in
a semi-official statement published
here as a result of a concerted effort
on the part of, the Central powers to
prevent an unexpected simultaneous
attack by the allies on all fronts.
The central empires "says the state
ment" wish to prevent even at the cost
of enormous sacrifices of men and ma
terial the allies from taki\g the initia
tive in the war operations and attack
ing them simultaneously on all fronts.
Such Is the plan of the Central pow
ers as revealed by the great Austrian
offensive on the Trentino front while
the Germans are reviving their of
fensive against Verdun. Germany and
Austria aim at wearing out France and
j Italy counting on temporary halt in
I Russian operations continuing.

STATE'S TRICK III
District Attorney Tried to I
Use Boy's Sweetheart to
Get Evidence.
WAUKEGAN, 111., May 24.?An nl
leged plan by. which State's Attorney
Ralph J. Dady expected to obtain a
confession from William Orpet that
be kiled Miss Marion Llambert by
appealing though a girl to the youth's
chivalry loomed as the great camp to
be sprung in the trial by the defense.
According to the plan, which, it ia
said is outlined in an affidavit in the
hands of tho defense, Dady went to
Miss Celeste Youker, for love of whom
Orpet cast aside Miss Lambert ,and
asked her to obtain the confession
from Orpet on threats of reading in
court the love letters written by Miss
Youker to Orpet while tho latter was
in Madison. The lotters. tho state
admitted- contained no bearing upon
the Lambert affair.
Accordingly Miss Youker sat down
to her task, her faitli in Orpet spur
ring her on to risk the possible be
trayal, anfi wrote Orpet, asking him
whether he was guilty.
In his answer, Orpet said, according
to the informant. "I am innocent of
Marlon's murder. I am telling you the
truth. Believe me."
While the defense and presecution
were struggling to complete the sec
ond panel of the jury Kenneth Allen,
a senior in the Waukegan High
school, took a poll of his class. Ac
cording to his figures, 17 of the boys
believed Orpet not guilty, four be
lieved him guilty and one had no opin
ion. Nineteen of the girls believed
him not guilty, eight believed him
guilty and sev?n had no opinion.
The state's case will be commenced
next Trfonday. it is thought, and two
weeks will be spent in piling up the
evidence the prosecution says it has
against the boy.
When the state has completed its
case the defense plans to ask the court
to give a verdict of not guilty, accord
ing to James H. Wilkerson of counsel
for Orpet.
"The motion will be based on a de
cision of the Illinois Supreme court re
versing the conviction in a murder
case where tho evidence was wholly
cirfcumstantial as it is in this case,"
said Wr. Wilkerson.

TIDE OF WAR EBBS A14D FLOWS BY INCHES
(By Associated Press)
PARIS, May 24.?A powerful offen
sive was undertaken by the Germans
last night to the eiV of Dead Man
hill on the Verdun front. The attempt
In general was unseceessful. the War
office reports of this afternoon says,
hut after a fierce hand-to-hand strug
gle the attacking forces made their
way into a portion of the village of
Cumieres.
The battle around Verdun continues
to rage with a violenco unexampled
even in this region. The Germans are
straining with every resource in their
power to capture Hill 304 and Dead
Man hill on the left bank of the Meuse !
and to win back the famous Fort Dou
aumont on the right bank which was
wrested from them by General Niv
elle's brilliantly planned and execut
ed offensive.
Without full possession of the line
from Peper hill to Vaux fort, the Ger
mans cannot hope to get any nearer
to the capture of Verdun. Even if they
succeeded in taking this line they
could not bold it unless they were al
so in possession of Hill 304 and Dead
Man hill which outflanks their line.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone the German
command has hurled attack after at
tack against Fort Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its on
?tfit on left bank of the river to
prevent the French from transferring
any forces to the main scene of at
tack. ? j
All day yesterday the tide of jrar
ebbed and flowed inches of ground be*
ing won and tost at an appaling cost
in men. As one French offiper said:
"Plots of land come high here."
Again and again after reducing
trenches to a crumbling heap of ruins
by a deluge of shells the German
infantry dashed forward only to be
ca&ght and swept away by a hurri
cane of curtain fire from the French
batteries and machine guns.
The conditions of the present way
I have transformed the traditional fori*
ous courage of the Frcnch soldiers in
to an immovable stoicism. Men have
stood their grounds manfully in a sit
uation which it seems beyond huhiau
nature to support.
When night fell last night the posU |
tions on both sides were unchanged.
The Fronch held firmly all their gains
while the Germans incurrod fearful I
losses without getting nearer to any
decision. i
Describing the battle around Dou
aumont one combatant said: "For
four miles behind us there was not
a trench for a communication noth*
ing but shell holes one with another.
Every inch of the ground was plow
ed up by an expenditure of ammuni
tion which is inconceivable. In holes
male by 15 inch shells you cold sta
ble fifteen horses easily. The few trees
still standing have been stripped of
branches and look like telegraph poles.
It is the abomination of desolation.
"Not for a second do the guns cease
roaring or men cease falling. As
soon as a trench Is made the shells
begin to drop and survivors have to
begin all over again. Attacks h?ve
become almost Impossible. Because of
the teriflc tornado of artillery fire
the infantry on either side are unable
