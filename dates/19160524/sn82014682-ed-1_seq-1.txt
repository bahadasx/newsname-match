AID TO SUBJECTS
Consul Rodiek and Secretary
Schroeder Helped Send Home
V Crews of Refugee Ships ;
Services on behalf of Chinese
subjects left In Honolulu by hundreds
when the German refugee ateamers
sought haven here to avoid the Al
llea' saa-patrol have won for German
Consul Georg P. Rodiek a decoration
by the Chinese government
The Star-BuMetln yesterday pub
lished the story that the Peking
newspaper Sun Ten Shipao carried
the news of Consul Rodiek's decora
, tion "by President Yuan Shih-Kai. No
clue was given as to the kind of ser
vices the- German consul in Hawaii
had rendered, and when the Star
Hulletin asked the consul about the
matter, he said: "It's news to me."
So It was, in fact It was to have
been Kept for-a surprise, the. Star
Bulletin learned today, until" the time
when the- decoration Itself should
have arrived. .
Threa other decorations are also on
their way. One ia for Consul Rodiek's
aecretary, H A. Schroeder, and the
other two are , for U Kwang Heng.
Chinese eleve consul, and Wang Kan
of the consular staff. Mr. Schroeder
receives a sixth-grade decoration, as
does Eleve Consul LI Kwang Heng.
while Mr. Wang Kaa receives a seventh-grade
order. Consul Rodiek's
order is of the fourth grade.
In the fall and winter of 1914 more
than 300 Chinese were put ashore, m
Honolulu when the German steam
ships tied here for refuge. Many of
hem came from the Chinese coast
or aouth seas,- where the Chinese
were shipped.
Put ashore here there was consid
erable difficulty in arranging for their
passage home. . They were neutrals
and entitled to fio back to China. In
straightening out the difficulty, Con
. sul Rodiek and Mr. Tsi-ang Woohuan,
the Chinese consul, worked for many
weeks nd the crews were sent back
In a number of shipments. -
When Dr. Wellington Koo, the new
Chinese ministei to Washington,
passed through here, be asked Consul
Woohuan concerning the handling of
this . problem of the Chinese subjects
and was told of Consul Rodiek's work.
It is oresumel that he sent from
Washington to" Peking an account of
the matter, and that this led to . the
decorations.

SEEK TO EJECT
HUGE ACREAGE
Agricultural Company Defends
ant in Action. Begun By :
bisnoo tsiaie rusies .,
.Action to eject ; the Walalua Agri-
onttitral I'nmnnnvi from 14.685 acres
of land situated at Kawailoa, this is-
t I hom.n loiM. with thp fil-
. with the fil
ing in circuit court of a suit in eject
ment by the trustees under the will
I of the late Bernice Pauahi Bishop.,
VTtte trustees, plaintiffs in the case,
are W. O. Smith, S. M. uamon. r .
Bishop, A. F. Judd and A. W. Carter,
thA Action havine been Instituted for
them by the law firm of Holmes &
Olson. :'
It Is alleged in the complaint that
the plaintiffs are the owners in fee
simple of 14,685 acres of land at.Ka-
walloa. now leased to the Walalua
Agricultural Company for a long term
of years. The action is based on an
allegation of breach of covenant by
the agricultural company; '
Under the terms of the lease, it is
understood, the plantation was to cul
tivate the land In question to its ut
most degree of productiveness, and al
so to Its utmost acreage. It Is the con
tention of the trustees of the Bishop
Estate that the agricultural company
has failed to live up -to this provi
sion, and that a large portion of the
land in question now remains uncul
tivated or not highly cultivated.
The complaint alleges "that the
plaintiffs claim the right of immediate
possession of and title In fee simple
to the piece or. parcel of land above
described by purchase; to wit, by de
vise under the will of the said Ber
nice Pauahi Bishop.- : f ,
Continuing, the complaint . alleges
"that the defendant herein, has un
justly, and contrary t6 the law and
the rights of the plaintiffs herein, en
tered into possession and, occupancy
of the said parcel of land.4
It is understood that the lease In
question haa yet approximately 20
years to run. According to an attor
ney for the plaintiffa, the trustees con
tend that from the outset of the lease
the agricultural company has failed
to cultivate certain portiona of the
land in question In the manner cove
nanted and that certain other portions
have been left unused. ;
The trustees, in concluding their
complaint, pray for restitution of the
land with costs. ,
The Manual of 'Hawaiian Securities
shows that the Waialua Agricultural
Company has 37.783 acres of leased
land and 4017 of fee simple land. Of
the leased land 82 3 are described as
Mcane land" and 29,510 as "pasturage,
etc." '
No other plant gives such a quan
tity of food to the acre as the banana,
which is 40 times more than that of
the potato and 133 times more than
that of wheat.
Broken plate glass is now salvaged
by the plate glass insurance compa
nies. The glass is cut into smaller
sizes and resold. .
sions to get home after the outbreak
of the war, so that the decoration of
the German consular officials here
is, Mr. Woohuan comments, 'part of S
broad plan of recognizing those who
aided 1 he Chinese subjects as neu
trals. Consul W'oohuan already is pos
sessor of a sixth-grade decoration, be
stowed a number of years ago In
China in recognition of his services to
the government. I

"When we first ronnooted our' hose
at the hydrants we found practically
no water." declared the chief. "It was
several minutes before I could notify
the water department to throw on
sonio pressure. All this time the
Blames were blazing fiercely with
nothing whatever to c heck them." '
During the whole fire the chier said
he did not have Fufficint pressure

The sound of snapping flames along ;
the side and roof f the barn was the '1
first warning that, .Mrs. Correa bad of 4
the fire. She ran at onc e to tne inier
ior of the building, to find the keeper,
August Freitas, wb4 was at work in
the harness room. -
As soon as Freitas learned of tlie
fire he yelled to her to send in word
by telephone to department headquarl

the horses. .His quick work saved
them nil. .
Mis. Correa ran across the street
to a neighbor who owns a telephone
and got word to the fire department,
which had engines bn the way at once.
The stables were! situated between
Kawalahao and Qaeen streets, next
to Cummlngs street, which meant a
onz run for the firemen over rough
reads. They arrived too late to save
the stables, but prevented th-further
snrettd of the flames. A ditch on the
Kwa s4de cf the sUble vaH and a
wind from the onnoslte direction also
nrevented the fire v from spreading
