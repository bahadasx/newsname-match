He told her . at ho and his asso

way they could get a bomb on a
Cunarder was to use women and a
baby. The women were to take the
baby aboard the ship and also a pack
age containing baby clothing. In this
package was to be concealed the
bomb.
"It was planned," the woman told
Mr. Battle, "that I was to carry
tho baby and with me was to be an

W wt, AT TWO POINTS ON -mM
MAY TALK ABOUT PEACE.
Former Chancellor Has Been
Mentioned in Connection
With Peace Parieys.
LONDON, May 24. The Ex
change Telegraph Company says It
learns from diplomatic circles that
Prince von Huelow, former Herman
Chancellor, Is proceeding to Wash
ington, charged by Kmperor William
with a special mission. One story
is that he Is to take the place of
Count von Bernstorff ns Ainbiisnador.
A rearrangement of the German
diplomatic corps is to be effected,
the Exchange stated.
It has boen rumored several times
that Ambassador Bernstorff might
be called home to an Important post.
Diplomats here said that If the le
port Is true, the sending of von Bue
low to Washington '.s another Indica
tion of Germany's plans to move for
on early peace. Von Rtielow's name
has been frequently connected with
peace nioes, especially during his
long stay In Kwlt?orland.
Prince von Buelow was sent to Rome
as Ambaador and assigned the task
of preventing Italy from Joining tho
Allies. When Italy declared war n
Austria a ycr.r ago he was recalled to
Berlin, but shortly afterward went to
Switzerland.
Swiss reports said that von Buelow,
at the Kaiser's request, had purpose
ly held aloof from active participa
tion In governmental affairs In order
that ho might better serve Germany
In peace negotiations. A man of
great personal charm, he has always
been considered one of tho best diplo
mats In Europe. So fnr as Is known
Prince von Buelow has made but one
address on tho subject of peace since
the war began. Speaking at Ham
burg more than a year ago he de
clared that Germany would make a
conqueror's peace.
WASHINGTON, May 24. German
Embassy officials to-day refused to
discuss the report regarding a dip
lomatic change that would replace
Count von Bernstorff here with
Prince von Buelow. Officials merely
stated "they had heard nothing of
such a report "
State Department oftlclali also
claimed ignorance of any such re
port. I'cjvately they ald they did
not see Just what reason Germany
would have for making such a change.
Should Prince von Buelow come to
Washington ntllclals thought It likely
bis task would be somewhat similar
to that assigned to Col. E. M. House
by President Wilson on several oc
casions when the former had visited
the belllgeient capitals. In addition
to securing first-hand Information as
to the American viewpoint on many
matters Involved In the war, the Km
poror might desire, It was said, to
adjust through a personal repre
sentative relations with the Washing
ton Government severely strained by
the submarine controversy.
It was suggested that Prince von
Buelow mlgnt also seek direct Infor
mation as to tho Administration's
views upon American neutrality, ac
clivity of Germans In conspiracies In
this cnuntiy and the sale of muni
tions to thn allies.

more than three dlvlslons-60,uoo men.

POTTER TO BE
N public otllclal announcement at 3 P.
M. to-day that he would let Mayor
Mltchel testify In full and In public
at 4.30 P, M. to-day about telephone
conversations that were "tapped" by
the police In the charities investiga
tion case. These talks, between the
Rev. Father Farrell and Dr. Potter.
'Mayor Mltchol declared on the wit
Ineas stand laat ovoning, had to do
I with a conspiracy In which Father
j Farrell and Dr. Potter were engaged
"to obstruct and pervert the admin
'istratlon of law and the city gov
ernment.
At that point Mayor Mltchel'a testl
mony was shut off by the gavel of
I Chairman Thompson, who declared
i the telephone com ersatlons were not
properly part of the Joint Legislative
Committee's investigation; and nt
that point Mayor Mltchol will resume
his testimony nt 4.30 P. M.
"Our committee," aald Senator
Thompson, "will hear Mayor Mrtchil
at 4.30 P. M. We still think that the
question of what the converation
were over the tapped telephone wlr
Is a question this committee should
not try- We haven't changed our
minds at all. We should not go Into
It, but we have been asked to go Into
It.
"We. however, cannot overlook the
fact that the Mayor Is the chief ex-
executive officer of this town. The
committee have not changed their
minds, that the conversations over
the telephones wete taken down by
persons who did not know the parties
or their voices, could not Identify the
parlies, and that the questions raised
by giving those conversations ought
not to bo raised before this com
mlttoe. "As we understand the facts, the
persons taking those telephone con
rrsatloris did not know the parties
who wero speaking and could not
recognize their voices or Identify
them. These persons did not take
correctly what was said on the wire.
They took It only In a fragmentary
way and In longhand.
