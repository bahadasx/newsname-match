Violent Fighting.

"In the region of Verdun the Ger

acter of extreme violence along the
whole of our front without It being
yet possible to specify the consider
able number of effectives engaged.
"On the left bank of the Meuse
after a bombardment with large
shells all morning the Germans
launched on several occasions their
assaulting masses against our posi
tions to the east and west of Le Mort
Homme. The first attack mowed
down by our artillery and machine
gun Are was repuIsM with sanguin
ary losses, without the enemy hav

"A second attack, likewise desper
ate, about 7 .o'clock in the evening
succeeded in gaining a footing in one
of our'trenches to the weet. An im

drove out the enemy.
"On th? right bank the region of
Haudremont, Douamont was the all
day theater of a murderous struggle.
The Germans multiplied their as
saults, which were preceded «£ch
time by very powerful artillery prep
