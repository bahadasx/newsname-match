as Colonel House Does For President
London, {May 24.—The Exchange
Telegraph Company 'says it learns
from diplomatic sources that Prince
von Buelow/" former German chancel­
lor, is proceeding to Washington,
charged by Emperor William with a
special mission.
The Exchange company says It also
understands the prince will become
ambassador to"the United States,
Printe vonlBue^ow has been referred
to recently as the man who might be
selected by Emperor Willlun to con-
duct peace negotiations should they be
undertaken. Late in 1914 the former
chancellor was sent to Rorfie and suc
ceeded" in delaying Italy's declaration
of war on Austria He is credited also
with having prevented war between
Germany and Italy.
From time to .time it ha6 been re
ported that von Buelow was engaged
in peace negotiations, but so far as has
been ascertained these fumoH were
without foundation.

ment officials were frankly skeptical
of the accuracy of the report that
Prince .iron BueloW was coming to
Washington on a special mission. They
have received no official or unofficial
information that such a visit was in

A high official pointe out that
the report originated in London, which

Bernstorff as aipbassador here, was
also doubted.
Should Prince von Buelow Arrive in
Washington on a special mission offi
cials thought }t' likely that h!s task
,would b«^somewhat similar to that as
signed to Col. E- M. House, when he
visited European capitals at President
Wilson's request.
It was suggested that Prince von
Buelow might seek direct Information
as ito the administration's views upon
America^*1/neutrality, activity of Ger
mans in conspiracies in this country
and sale of munitions to the allies. T^o
official would'hazard speculation re
garding the possible attitude of the
