Ratified

erica to-day adopted without debate a
report from the committee on hills
and overtures warning the New York
and all other Presbyteries that the
tenets of the church must he ac
cepted by candidates for the ministry
before they should be ordained.
This action, it is believed, ends
further discussion in the present as
sembly of the alleged heresy question
tn which the New Vork Presbytery
and Union Theological Seminary are
involved.
The committee had before it more j
than two dozen overtures from ;
Presbyteries from many parts of the
country dealing with the heresy con- j
troversy. The one which attracted the j
most attention and to which serious j
consideration was Riven by the com
mittee was that from the Cincinnati
Presbytery which proposed that the
•New York Presbytery he expelled lie-j
cause It licensed three young men who
are alleged to hold views at variance
with the doctrines of the church.

■London, May 24.—The Exchange

]t is in the thickly populated for- !
eign settlement of North Seventh ;
street and its adjacent blocks that the <
need of a community center cliielly j
for the protection of the young people J
is most keenly felt. Some who un-1
derstand the situation feel that it
should partake of the nature of a set- |

the school buildings. However, this is
a question which must work out its,
own answer. Boys and girls of the
higher grades, pitifully hungry for
pleasure, seek it wherever most easily
found usually upon the streets. The
school is their workshop to which
many have little desire to return at
the end of the day's duties unless un
usual attraction may be offered. One
young girl freely acknowledged that
she spends nearly every evening in the
