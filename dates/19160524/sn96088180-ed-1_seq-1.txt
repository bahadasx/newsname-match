In 1815, at the hearing of the fed

bear to secure direct assistance In
perfecting organisation among the
fruit growers than for help In any

was that three of the best exports

SENDIN& NEW NOTE
Washington, May 24. It is not ex
pected here that the new note from
Provisional President Carranza, in
transit today by messenger, will make
flat demands for withdrawal of Amer
ican troops from Mexico, but it is ex
pected to contain urgent suggestions
that euch a withdrawal is expected.
It is likely to show resentment at the
dispatch of a second American expe
dition across the border.
. Carranza is expected to urge that
the United States troops are not
needed any longer as he has raised
a large army for patrol duty. If he
can convince the war department that
this is true, the withdrawal will prob
ably be automatic.
So far the department is not con
vinced, Carranza is believed . so
friendly that he will not press de
mands which might become trouble
some. .'
No request for financial aid has
been received from . Mexico. The
American government Is unable to
make loans directly, although it
might stand sponsor for other loans.

Paris. May 24. From Dead Mai's
bill eastward to the ruins of Fort '
Donaumont tbe most savage battla
in tbe world's history Is raging today.
Eighty thousand Germans were
sent crashing Into the French posi
tions on Dead Man's hill, while two
Teuton brigades rushed repeatedly
during the night at the soldiers of tho
republic holding Donaumont Every
asssult was a failure.
Fighting in the Donaumont ruins
attained its greatest intensity at noo
yesterday. . Germans ' covered all
French trenches from Thiaumont to
Douaumont with a steady -artillery
fire. Behind great columns of dust
tbe gray German lines swept toward
the French works. French machine
guns sprayed the charging ranks, but
still the waves of spiked helmets
came on and swarmed over the west
ern and northwestern edges of Donau
mont. : -". .;'"":." "
Hen a bloody straggle began. Man
fought against man, clinging to steep
parapets, climbing through narrow
alleys and slashing through dense en
tanglements of barbed wire. Bayonets
and hand grenades became useless,
so closely were the fighting troopers
wedged together. Shoved forward
by the press of comrades at their
backs, the Germans battled with fists
and stabbed with knives. :
When one such assault was defeat
ed by the French and Its surriror .
ejected from the' works, another was
started. Throughout the day the
Germans attacked repeatedly. There
was no change when night came. In
spite of this terrific hammering,
French troops retained all positions
taken on Monday. The loss at this
point In the first two days of the des
perate fighting is estimated at 10,000
killed.
The Germans since Sunday, recited
the communique, have been attack
ing the northwestern front of Ver-
dun with sixty thousand men.
Throughout last night tha battle was
waged furiously. Both banks of the
Mense were assaulted, but French
troops stubbornly resisted. Inflicting
heavy losses on the enemy.
Hand-to-hand fighting preceded .
German capture of Cumleres Tillage.
On the Meuse east bank Germans,
after extensive artillery preparations,
launched repeated charges against
the Haudremont-Douaumont front,
losing fearfully. 1 .
German fire blotted out French
trenches, but the defenders stuck to
the debris and battled the advancing
Teutons with bayonet, clubbed rifle
and knife.
- -tuoBi or r on vouaumom, uespue a
deadly fire from machine guns, a few
German detachments streamed
through the French bullets and reach
ed their objective positions. West of;
the fort all charges were halted.. The
Germans used gas west of the Ns
varln farm, but failed to progress.
