Vast Throng Greets Wilson at
Charlotte
Charlotte, N. C., May 20.?An
appeal for humanity was made
by President Woodrow Wilson
today in an address before an
immense throng that had gathered
to greet the executive and the
first lady of the land, and to cele
brate the 141st anniversary of
the Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence.
Estimates of 100,000 have been
placed on the crowd that was
today .within Charlotte's gates,
and each person of this vast
number did his small part in
greeting Mr. and Mrs. Wilson to
the South.
The governor of South Carolina
and the governor of North
Carolina and their staffs met
here and welcomed President
and Mrs. Wilson, and Josephus
Daniels, secretary of the navy,
Secretary Tumulty, Dr. Cary T.
Grayson, Senator Lee S. Over
man. Congressman Webb and
other prominent personages
joined in proclaiming it an
epoch making day in the history
of twentieth of May celebrations.
The president's address was
brief but pointed. Wo Id peace
was his theme, and in his closing
appeal he said: I would like to
think that the spirit of this occasion
could be expressed if we
imagined ourselves lifting some
sacred emblem of counsel and
of peace, of accommodation and
righteous judgement, before the
nations of thf? worlrt anH rpminH.
in them of that passage in scrip
ture: 'Alter the wind, aflei the
earthquake, after the fire, the
still small voice of humanity.'"
Mr. Wilson said that it is an
interesting circumstance that the
processes of war stand still, and
continuing he said:
"These hot things that are in
contact with each other do not
make very much progress
against each other. When you
can not overcome, you must
take counsel. See then, ladies
and gentlemen, what a new age
we have come into. I should
think that it would quicken the
imagination of every men and
quicken the patriotism of every
man who cared for America.
Here in America we have tried
io sei me example ol bringing
all the world together upon
terms of liberty and cooperation
and peace, and in that great experience
that we have been go
ing through America has been a
sort of prophetic sample of man
kind. Now the world outside
of America has felt the forces of
America; felt the forces of freedom
ttlf? ff?rrpc r>( r-Ammrvn n?
...-w v/i VV/111U1V/11 iia*
piration, the forces that bring
every man and every nation
face to face with this question,
'What are you going to do with
your power? Are you going
to translate it into force,
or are you going to translate it
into peach and the salvation ot
society?'"
The president arrived shortly
after 10 o'clock and the arrival
was signalized by the president
tial salute of 21 guns, fired by
James D. Lee ol|Columbia.
The president and party went
*? '1
liiiiucurdiciy iu uiu reviewing
stand, along an announced
route, which was composed of
veritable walls of human beings.
Every precaution had been
taken by the secret service and
by the Charlotte authorities to
give ample police protection.
Chief Richardson of Columbia
and six officers, Messrs. Jones,
Kellv. Carter. Rrnnm Drohur
and Jackson rendered valuable
service, as did a squad of men
from the Rock Hill force. The
Charlotte outhorities requested
these men and will return the
favor during fair week or any
time that the South Carolina
cities desire their services.

Uncle John Gives a Health Talk
"What's all that you're carrvin'
home?" we asked Uncle John,
as he drove by our place Saturday
afternoon and alighted for
his usual verbal "set to."
"That in the big can?" he asked,
"why, that's coal oil I'm carrying
home to fix the mosquitoes
with. We ain't had none to
cVinur fin trot Kt?* T'm nrn4?i?i'
u??v M up 7 vi) UUI A All ^VlllU (UUI
oil an' am goin* to use it to see
that none do show up. After a
hard day's \york they's nothin' I
like better'n to set on the porch
an hour or two an' cool off 'fore
turnin' in, but the pesky skeeters
have always been so bad I didn't
enjoy it overly much. You might
think my old ankles wuz gettin'
pretty old an' tough, an' I guess
they are, but them mosquitoes
have seemed to think they wuz
pretty good pickin'."
"It is wonderful what the critters
will chew on sometimes."
we agreed.
"But while their bitin' wuz a
powerful bother," went on
Uncle John, ignoring our intend
ed joke about his ankles, "that
ain't the main reason why I've
got it in fer 'em. You know last
summer my boy Sam got flat of
his back with chills an' fever,
an' when he wuzn't shakin' an'
shiverin'he wuzn't fit fernothin'.
Doc Stringer shoveled the quin
ine into him till he finally got
onto his feet, but Doc's bill along
with several pounds of quinine,
figgered up a round hundred
dollars. So I said no more chills
an' fever fer me, if they's anyway
to help it.
"Doc Stringer's a pretty levelheaded
feller, an* I asked him if
they wuzn't somethin' that'd
keep it off.
" 'Sure', he said, 'all you got to
do is not let the mosquitoes bite
you. You see, them mosquitoes
are full o' malary bugs, an' when
they stick their bill into you
they fill you full of 'em. These
grow inside of a feller, an' when
they multiply to about a hun
ired million, the man who is the
unhappy possessor o' them pro
ceeds to have a chill, an' they
git worse, an' worse, an' if >'ou
don't do sometliin' to kill them,
why they just finally kill you."
"'Jiminy, Doc, I says, s' I, do
you mean to say you'd kill all
them things an' leave 'em dead
in your system?'
" 'Sure,' he said, 'dead bugs
are better'n live uns, an' besides,
your system soon burns out their
remains, an' if you won't let any |
more mosquitoes bite you, you'll
never have any more chills an'
fever.'
"Well, ?ir, that stumped me.
But what he said looked reasonable,
an' I got busy. Me an' the
boys screened every door and
window an' one end o' the
porch, an' ditched out the
sloughs down in the swamp, an'
nr/\ nnrpA/l lU/*
nit; test u uic summer
in peace, so fer's mosquitoes wuz
concerned. An' we ain't had
no more chills nor doctors' bills,
an' don't 'low to have, as loner's
wa c'n co anything to Keep from
it. I'm gona put that oil on
every hole o* water in a mile of
our place. Mosquitoes are gona
have a mighty poor show out
our way this year."
"You're dead right, Uncle
John," we put in. "There's
nothing better than good health,
is there?"
"Finest they is," replied the
old man, as he put on his hat to
go.?Progressive Farmer.
"It's no use," sighed Freddy;
"I certainly can never learn to
spell."
"Why not?" inquired his mother.
"How the dickens can I ever
learn," he demanded hotly,
"when the teacher changes the
words every day?"
Preacher Attacks Bunal Service
That there is a lie in the burial
services was the statement of
a distinguished clergyman in a
public address recently delivered
from the steps of the city hall in
Brooklyn. He declared that the
practice of ascribing deaths to
the Almighty instead of to the
true causes was lying of a pretty
base order. The result of this
bold statement was an aronsal of
a great deal of professedly righteous
wrath and the minister in
his efforts to state medical truths
and defend the Lord against the
most hackneyed of slanders wasl
publicly denounced.
The Medical Times commenting
on this incident savs: "Why
is it blasphemous in this year of
grace to tell the truth about the
real origin of infectious diseases?
Why ascribe to God a death
from typhoid fever, the source
of which is polluted drink water?
What have the Dark Ages got
on us, anyway?"
The State Board of Health
agrees with the Medical times
and says: Blaming deaths from
preventable diseases on Providence,
calling them "mysterious
dispensations of Providence" is
rapidly passing in North Carolina
under the light of public
health education, to the extent
that a number of ministers have:
publicly expressed themselves as:
rof11 cinnr t/-? neo V,~ ..^....11 :~il
viu?>uf^ IU uov lilt USUU1 UU11U1
services in connection with a
death from typhoid or from
some other preventable disease,
which attributes the death to
"His Will" rather than to the
true source?carelessness and
neglect of some human being.

Sunday Speaks For Wives.
"You want a smiling: religion,
the kind that makes you g:o
home and kiss your wife, the
kind that brings joy into your
home," Bill Sunday shouted
Wednesday nig[ht, says the Kansas
City Star.
"Try praising: your wife, even
if it does frighten her at first.
Maybe she'll faint the first time,
but she'll g:et used to it.
"Treat j'our wife after you are
married twenty-five years the
same as you did when you were
feeding: her on gumdrops and
Sugared hearts. Don't wait as
some husbands do and send a
wreath of roses to her after she's
dead. I'd rather have one rosebud
now than ten thousand after
I'm dead.
!) "It would spoil a mule to treat
It as some of you men treat your
Wives. Men have done a great
fieal in this little old world, but
women have done more. Thank
heaven, God made one apiece
for us, and if you haven't got
yours it's your fault. She's always
been the hope and inspiration
of this old world, even to
die making of mittens for Eskimos
and helps for Hottentots.
She's made all the sponge cake
$nd baked all the beans that
l^ave kept the church steeples
from falling down all over this
fend of ours. She's run the ba
iuars and the rummage sales
tjjiat have kept the ship of Zion
off the rocks.
? We're a lot of brutes in refus
?g to give her the right to vote.
$ne reason why I believe in
wnman suffrage is that the prin<5pal
objection to it comes from
t$e whiskey gang."

Liquid Fire?Past and Present.
From The Wall Slrccl Journal.
The use by the Germans of
fire throwing machines in the
assault on Verdun has been hailed
as something new in military
operation. As a matter of fact,
liquid fire is a product of the
warfare ot the Middle Ages. In
the strenuous davs when our
doughty ancestors were besieged
in castles, thev used to amuse
I themselves by standing on the
ramparts and pouring boiling
oil and burning pitch below.
This usually proved disconcert
ing for the attacking party.
The Germans have gone several
steps farther. All the accessories
that the Knights of old
brought into play in the gentle
art of fire-hurling were a bucket,
its contents, and a good strong
pair of arms. The modern Teutonic
fiery fluid can be distributed
much more deftly and with
greater force by reason ot a simple
little device, known as a
"fire projector." Petrol is poured
into a tank under pressure of
several hundred pounds per
square inch. The tank is equip
pea vvitn a long nozzle, and the
pelrol is enflamed as it leaves
the nozzle by an electric spark.
Thus the German soldier is able
to sit safely behind his own lines
and spray the enemy with fire
over a distance of more than 100
feet much in the manner of a
suburbanite watering his garden
with an oversized garden hose.

Adjures Germans to Observe
Law
Washington, May 18.?Germany,
through Count von Berns'jrff,
has instructed all German
consuls in the United States to
admonish German citizens in
their districts scrupulously to observe
American laws. This was
done in an effort to end various
alleged violations of American
neutrality.
It was said at the German embassy
that the instructions were
designed to prevent plots or lawlessness
on the part of German
citizens who might be disposed
to engage in such. The German
government, it was said, looks
with great disfavor upon any
such conduct and desires that
thpv shnll nnt iinrmirn !?

undertaking: in any way outside
the law.
It was not disclosed whether
specific cases have been brought
to the attention of the German
government but it was made
clear that Berlin officials want
the United States and its people
to understand that they have not
countenanced any illegal affairs
with which German citizens or
sympathizers in this country
have been connected.
M'Laurin Not Pleased
Columbia, May 19.?Senator
McLaurin says that, in spite of
the refusal of the convention to
place him in the primary, he
will "take that course which
shall seem to me best to get an
exposition of the principles of
the State Warehouse System
clearly before them."
He charges that the members of
the convention were whipped
into line by tbeery?of "Riease
in the woodpile." He also labels
all factions "fakes and frauds."
His statement also asserts that
South Carolina has never had a
real business Administration and
attacks the whole public pay

Mr. and Mrs. L. A. Griffin.
A little girl in Jersey who had
a bantam was disappointed at
the smallness of the lirst egg
laid by the bird.
Her ideal egg was that of the
ostrich, a specimen of which lay
on the table in the parlor.
One day the ostrich egg was
missing from its accustomed
place. After a prolonged search
it was found near the bantam's
nest, and on it was stuck a piece
of paper with the words:
"Something like this, please.
