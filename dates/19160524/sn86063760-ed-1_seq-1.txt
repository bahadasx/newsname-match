Columbia.
A complete re-enrollment this year
of al white Democratic voters in the
state of South Carolina is required by
the rules adopted by the state conven
tion in its meeting; the machinery for
this was later provided at the meet
ing of the state executive committee
which named the first Tuesday in
June as the day for opening the club
regisration books. The system of en
rollment will be the same as two
years ago, and the books will be in
almost identically the same form.
The Christensen faction of the
Beaufort delegation not only won its
place in the convention but also se
cured the protection of the state pri
mary machine In municipal affairs.
The new rules provide that a primary
shall be held in any city of not more
than 10,000 inhabitants on petition of
1) per cent cf the qualified voters.
The county-to-county canvass of
delegates for state offices will begin
Tuesday. June 20, and will not end
until shortly before the first primary
August 29. The itinerary has been left
in the hands of a subcommi'tee of the
state executive committee to consist
of John Gary Evans of Spartanburg,
chairman. Wilie Jones of Columbia
and G. A. Guignard of Lexington coun
ty. This year the candidate will visit
45 county seats, McCormick having
been lately added to the roster o
towns competent to support the "bien
nial circus."
Unexpectedly to its scattered sup
porters, the delegations favoring the
abolition of the state campaign as
carried on for a number of years de
cided not to force a fight on their
rule on the floor of the convention
but let the matter die in the commit
tee room where, it is said, able argu
ments and much discussion preceded
the unfavorable report by the com
mittee. It is certain, however, that:

Issues Licenses to New Companies.
Insurance Commissioner McMaster
said that he had issued licenses to the
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
company of Boston, and the Southern
Mortgage company of Atlanta, as
mortgage loan companies to make
' loans in South Carolina. The John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance com
pany is not licensed to write life in
surance but solely to make mortgage
loans. It already has mortgage loansl
throughout the United States exceed
ing $55,000,000.
The Southern Mortgage company of
Atlanta has a capital of $300,000 and
an experience of many years in the
farm loan business in Georgia and
elsewhere. It has decided to under
take the placing of loans for farmers
in South Carolina. This means the
bringing of considerable money into
the state as the Southern Mortgage
Co. has clients in the East who have
placed a groat deal of money through
it on Georgia farms. Among its cus
tomers for these loans is the John,
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance com
pany of Boston.
It is understood that these com-1
panies will continue their loans to
farm mortgages. The companies later
will announce the methods by which
they will make loans.
In this connection the insurance
commissioner has Information that
the New York Life Insurance company i
very recently has loaned $45,000 on the
Masonic temple in Greenville, two
loans of $13,000 and $7,000 on city'
property in Florence, $6,000 on private
property in Florence, and $9.000 on a
farm in Richland county.
Several New Charters Issued.
The secretary of state has Issued
a charter to Smith's Grocery Com
pany, Inc., of Mullins with a c:n-ital !
of $2,000. The officers are G. E. Smith,
