Practlcaly all the delegates to the
convention returned yesterday to their
homes. Fur approximately 14 hours
many of the defecates, espsdaly those
serving on one of the three largo com
mlttsea were constantly at work with
details of the convention. During
tkat time the convention was actually

In approximately the same result.
The Christen sen faction of the
Beaufort delegation not only won Its
place In the convention but also se?
cured the protection of the State pri?

t Unexpected to ' its scattered sup?

cided not to force a fight on their
rule on the floor of the convention, but
let the matter die In the committee

unfavorable report by the committee.
It Is certain, however, that the reso?

convention proper, even had the prop?
osition been carried before the higher
tribunal.

ALBERT TURNABE CAPTURED.

ARRESTE!) BY MAYOR LEACH AT
ABERDEEN SATURDAY MORN?
ING.
Deputy Forbes and Rural Policeman
Newman Brought Prisoner Back to
Sumter Sunday Morning and Placed
Him In Comity JalL
From The Dally Item, May 22.
Albert Turnage, the alleged slayer
of Eugene Rainey on the night of
May 1, was arreated in Aberdeen, N.
C, Saturday morning by Mayor Ralph
Leach of that place and was brought
I back to Sumter Sunday morning and
placed in the county jail.
The oncers from here made a
quick trip to Aberdeen and back. It
was about noort that they received in?
formation/that Turnage had been tak?
en and Deputy Sheriff Forbes and Ru?
ral Policeman Newman left here on
the 1:30 train over the Seaboard for
Aberdeen. Arriving there at about
10 o'clock at night, they found Tur?
nage in the lockup with half a dosen
men guarding him. After taking re?
freshments they got into **lfr. L. L.
Johnson's car, who offered to bring
them back to Sumter for a reasonable
sum, and left Aberdeen at about
midnight for Sumter. The party in
the car arrived in Sumter at 7 o'clock
Sunday morning and after placing
their prisoner in the jail, went to se?
cure refreshments and sleep, of which
[they were very much in need after
their all-night ride.
According to the story told the of?
ficers, Turnage was arrested by Mayor
Leach on Saturday morning, after a
hard scrap in which the mayor had
to call for assistance, with which
the negro was considerably battered
up by the time he was over attempt?
ing further resistance to his captors.
He was then locked up In the guard
bouse and kept for the Sumter offi?
cers, who were notified. The sher?
iffs office had sent out bulletins an?
nouncing the fact that Turnage was
wanted here for murder charge and
Officials at Aberdeen were among
notified, Deputy Sheriff Forbes
tunced in bulletin*
that h* ??d an ui
Saturday morning when Mr. Coach
went to his mill just outside* of town,
he found Turnage there and at once
I decided he was a susipiclous character.
I After some conversation he got Tur?
nage near enough to -catch him and
then the two scrambled until assist?
ance came and the negro was con?
quered.
The sheriff is confident of having
sufficient circumstantial evidence to
convict Turnage on the charge of
murder when he comes up for trial
in the circuit court. Turnage in the
meantime is being kept in a cell in the
jail so that all possibility of his escape
is removed.

accepted the position at the first of
last year, Miss White being a student
of art even before there was an art
department at the city schools, having
specialized In this work at college and
taken a special course at Columbia

laughter. Immediately Senator Till?

not like you fellows in Colorado;

meant any harm, and that he didn't

amused the senate.

SPECIMENS OF WORK IN DOMES?
TIC SCIENCE AND ART DE?
PARTMENTS SEEN.
Large Nutter of Vitttor? at
ton School Building on Friday Af?
ternoon to See Work of Student*.
There was a large attendance of
parent*, relatives and friends of the
school children at the Hampton
school building on Friday afternoon,
the occasion being the annual ex?
hibition in the art, manual training
and domestic science departments.
The exhibit this year was confined to
the high school practically and was
not nearly so large as usual, but
was a high standard of qu?l?
te all of the object* and article*
:ed on exhibition and there, were
?- any comments from the visitors fa
>rable to the work of the student*.,
'Miss Obenschain la in charge of the
lomestic science department* and
while she did not have a large''ex
hlblt, she had a vary representative
one of the work which the pup 11* La
her department are doing.
First there was an exhibt of ? YSv
rous kinds of breads, biscuits, light
bread, rolls, etc which the girls had
made. These looked good to the eye,
but the palates of the visitors were
not given an opportunity to pass- on
them. Then there wa% a quantity Of
preserves, jellies and such work which
the young ladies had made. These
looked even more Inviting than the
breads, and they showed to ? some ex?
tent the lessons given by Miss Oben?
schain in her department.
But there were also the products of
domestic art and the young la?
dies were taught the mysteries . of.
other phase* of the house wife* dally .
task. There were piles of beautifully
embroidered garment* which ladiep
wear?name unknown to the writer*? ?
all decorated with pretty ribbon and
frills and seemingly of great interest
to the ladies, for all of them stopped
at this table, examined the articht*
closely and made favorable comments.
Then there were handkerchief baft,
cuffs and collars, little apron* frern
in the kitchen?in thg'
science clans?and a whole lot
er things. All of these were very
teresting and pretty, and arranged 111
a neat manner for inspection by find
visitors. i
The art and manual training de?
partment produced a diversity Of
work under the supervision of ft*
Elizabeth White. Little waste paper
baskets and boxes made of ..paste?
board and neatly tied with rib*
bons or raffia were an attrac?
tive feature. These were embel?
lished with various figures drawn on
the sides, so as to make them orna?
mental, as well as useful. The raffia
work was chiefly shown in the output
of trays and work baskets, although
there were other things also to which *
the student* had turned their handi?
work. Many of these articles were
woven with various colored straw
and were most artistic and engenious
in design and workmanship. The
usual number of pretty pictures In
water colors by the students
very attractive and received no lit?
tle attention from the visitors. The
work was in many instances original
both in design and execution and of
I an excellent quality, considering the
producers.
A new feature of the exhibit wan
the prints made by the pupils for
I stamping cloth. These wood block
prints were designed and made by the
students in the art department and
used most successfully in transferring
the students designs to table cover*
land other similar articles.
The usual display of penmanship
was missing this year from the ex?
hibitor, as was the display of work
from the smaller grades of the schoolc
This does not mean that this work
has been discontinued, but a change
from the usual exhibit was desired
for this year.
During the evening punch was
served by the young ladles of the
graduating class, while others met
the visitors at the door and ushered
them into thj reception hall, show?
ing them the various features of the
exhibit and in every way endeavoring
to welcome and make all who came
feel at home. Music was also render*
ed on the piano by young ladles of
the school and the Vlctrola was kept
going, when the pupils left the piano.
'The exhibit gets better each year,"
was the comment made by many visi?
tors.
