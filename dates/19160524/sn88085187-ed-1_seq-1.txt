FREDDIE FILM DEMANDS MORE PICTURES OF BABIES
By Freddie Film
A certain Tacoma movie house
waa well filled last night. It is
reasonable to suppose that tho
bulk of the folks who patronize
the vaudeville and moving pic
ture slums to kill time of an
evening are either childless or
else their children have grown up.
Now, what do you suppose
made the big hit with the pat
rons?
It wasn't the travel films,
. though they were good. It wasn't
' any of the high-salaried actors,
though their work was excellent.

FRATERNITY AT
11. OF W. ADOPTS
5-YEAR-OLD ROY
BY D'LOSS SUTHERLAND
Clarence Eckberg was horn sometime in April
five yean ago. Clarence was the leventh child lo a*
rive in the hungry Eckberg home and the father of
die brood did not have the strength to sec the family
through, lie left, and with his leaving the children
were scattered throughout the land at different chil
dren i and foundlings' homes.
•That was five yean ago, and it is not known if
Clarence's original mother is alive today. But he is
not worrying for lie has 26 mothers, fathers and
brothers all at once,
He has been adopted by the Sigma Nu fra^rnity
at the University of Washington.
The members of the organization feeling that the
fraternity really had ideals that meant more than
the frothy, rah rah, noisy life generally accredited to
a university fraternity, decided to give a homeless
waif a home and the faculty a demonstration that a
love for more than "rough house" existed in their
body.
Tht,' "hunch*' was firsl given birth hy the appeal
id' Belgian relief leaders to the American homes of
plenty when it was urged that the homeless children
of Belgium he adopted. The more the collegers
though! the bigger the "hunch" grew.
One fair haired student made a trip to the Aeker
nian Children's home on Mercer Island last week
ami together with Mis. Vera Jones Edwards, head
of the home, lined up the kids and gave them a mili
tary inspection.
He began weakening, until long near the end of
the line a close-cropped, mud-spattered little hoy
smiled up at him between two rosy cheeks which
showed through the coat of grime.
"Heine" said he guessed he'd take this one.
After the necessary formalities were dismissed,
Clarence and his new father and mother left with all
of the kid's biography incased in "Heine's" mind. It
consisted of about 10 words.
At the chapter house, the hoy immediately "fell"
for his new surroundings. He was put to bed while
his white linen suit was scoured in the hath tub.
Another in the house washed his ears, and a third,
after he was dressed, took him to a downtown store
where he was strutted up in a new suit, shoes, stock
ings, and other things worn by boys.
He was in a dream during his first meal. Seated
between two husky youths, who were appointed as
his body guard, Clarence was seen only from his
head up. But that is where the food is handled and
that was all that needed to be seen.
He learned "Bow Down to Washington," the col
lege song, the first day.
Strawherries graced the table that first dinner.
Clarence ate four berries at a time and smiled appre
ciatively between gulps.
At dusk the kid smiled a sleepy smile at his 25
fathers and informed them that he had heen accus
tomed to retiring at 8 o'clock. About 14 helped him
into his nightgown and laid him in his own bed in
the corner of a large air room.

And what is more the whole university is impress

members of the hig boys' family now take something
home to the boy. They are impressed, and the boy is
impressed.
Other fraternities have followed. Beta Theta Pi
and .Sigma Alpha Epsilon have adopted boys. Two
sororities have taken sisters to "make ladies'' of
them.
One student, J. B. Alexander, captain of the uni
versity company of the national guard, assumed the
responsibility of bringing up a boy all by himself.
The university authorities are enthusiastic over the
development and are encouraging it to their greatest
extent.
