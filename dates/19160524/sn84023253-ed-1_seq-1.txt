team stepped directly in front of one
of the buzz wagons that have made

were only superficial, consisting of a
bruised face and arm and strained lig

INDUSTRIAL
EXPOSITION

Very Successful Presentation of St
Johnsbury Products; And Com
munity Spirit
GOV. GATESA GUEST
Excellent Exhibition by Public Schools
and the Academy Two Big
Street Parades and Street
Carnival To Cloda The
Week's Festivities.
From the delightful visit of the chief
executive of the state to the crowded
informality of carnival night the In
dustrial Exposition was one grand suc
cess and everyone is patting the Com
mercial club on the back and assur
ing them that the town never had any
thing like it. The exposition was far
beyond the expectations of all and
even the exhibitors admitted that they
never saw its equal In larger towns.
Great credit is due the committee who
worked so faithfully for its success
and to E. W Hellie who has devoted
all his time to it lately and from the
very beginning had furnished both
labor and inspiration to further its
success. On Thursday evening nearly
2,000 people were in the bunaing.
Gov. Charles W. Gates spent
Thursday afternoon visiting his
friends and at 7:30 Frank H.
Brooks brought him over to the St.
.Tnhrshnrv House in his car. where
he was met by the St. Johnsbury Con
solidated band and a reception com
mittee, consisting of Henry J. Good
rich. Charles E. Peck, Z. S. Water
man and Arthur F. Stone. The band
and the governor and party then pro
ceeded to the Exposition building, f ol
lowed by a large crowd.
At the building' the governor was
escorted around, taking great Inter
est in the exhibits of the products
made and sold in St Johnsbury. At
8.30 he was introduced to the crowd
and 'made a short and inspiring ad
dress, standing in one of the automo
biles on the first floor. 1 -
Governor Praises St.. Johnsbury.
Gov. Gates spoks of the part St.
Johnsbury had played In the Indus
trial development of Vermont, noting
especially that it was the men born
and raised In this town that had made
its industrial growth, and that the
founders of our great industry had a
breadth of vision and philanthropic
nature so that all were now sharers
In their success. He said he was
especially gratified to see such a won
derful display of the enterprise of the
town in this exposition and that St,
Johnsbury always had a warm place
in his heart.
After his address he was Introduced
to many of the people present and
late in the evening returned to Under
clyffe for the night.
The great attraction of Friday's
program was the parade of the school
children at 2 o'clock and certainly no
such splendid sight has ever been
seen on our streets than was witnessed
Friday afternoon -when over 1,400
school children paraded. The pri
mary grades of both the public and
parochial schools were transported In
automobiles, many of them gaily dec
orated with flags, while all the rest
of the scholars marched in the line
which was led by the St. Johnsbury
band. The parochial schools also had
their band which was frequently ap
plauded along the line of march. St.
Johnsbury Academy led off, marching
by classes with 218 In line. The
graded schools had as their leaders a
platoon of boys dressed as carpenters
and carrying saws under their arms.
The public schools were assembled by
grades and there were nearly 870 in
the line. The parochial schools had
over 327 young folks in the line of
march and the effect of the whole
parade was inspiring. The children
were all admitted free to the Expo
sitlon building after the parade and
all availed themselves of the chance to
see the big show.
The attraction of the evening was
the concert by the Academy Glee
clubs and orchestra and the building
was well filled to hear them and the
applause was most gratifying. These
organizations are doing splendid work,
under trained leaders, and always
draw a crowd when they appear.
The automobile and civic parade
Saturday afternoon was a notable at
traction and the streets were thronged
with enthusiastic spectators. There
were nearly 200 automobiles In line,
mostly filled with happy school chil
dren, and the floats and other feat
ures of the parade were fine.
The St. Johnsbury Consolidated
band, its members clad in spotless
white, led the procession, followed by
some of the uniformed organizations.
The TJ. C. T.. also clad in white, fol
lowed the band, and the other orders
represented were the Odd Fellows in
uniform, the Catholic Order of Forest
ers and the Knights of Columbus. Fol
lowing the latter were members of
Chamberlln Post in automobiles.
Palmer Brothers followed with a
highly creditable display of boys on
gaily trimmed bicycles. The Fair
banks float, the Outlook club, the Co
mus club, the Chln-Chin club and
other clubs in decorated cars followed.
Then came a long line of automobile

VERMONT'S DELEGATION
Probably Will Be Headed by T. N.
Vail and All Elected Without Con
test at Montpelier Friday.
The state republican convention to
elect delegates to the national con
vention to be held at Chicago June 7,
will be t held at Montpelier Friday of
this week". It looks now as though it
would be a love feast and the eight
delegates elected without a contest.
It was learned yesterday that Stanley
C. Wilson of Chelsea, chairman of the
republican state committee, who had
been favorably mentioned as a can
didate for a delegate, has withdrawn
his name. Yesterday George L. Grid
ley of Windsor, who had announced
his candidacy as a delegate, telephon
ed Fred Babbitt of Bellows Falls that
he would not contest with him for
the honor.
Another rumor circulated in the
southern section of the state was that
Hon. Alexander Dunnett of this place
would be a candidate. Mr. Dunnett
said Tuesday evening that he would
not be a candidate. He will present
to the convention the name of T. N.
Vail as chairman of the Vermont
delegation and It is expected he will
be unanimously elected to that. posi
tion.
It looks now as though the delega
tion will be made up as follows:
Theo N. Vail of Lyndon, George H.
Prouty of Newport, Hugh M. Jones of
Montpelier, Fred H. Babbitt of Bel
lows Falls, John T. Cushlng of St
Albans, Guy W. Bailey of Essex Junc
tion, E. R. Morse of Rutland and Col
lins M. Graves of Bennington.
It Is probable the delegation will go
uninstructed, but It is supposed every
member favors Hughes first.

FARM DEMONSTRATIONS.
The County Agent Has One In Each
Town In the County Spray,
ing Work.
The greater part of the past week
was spent In arranging demonstra
tions. The county agent visited Lyn
don, Wheelock, Sheffield, Peacham,
Burke, Newark and Klrby. Up to
the present time 15 demonstrations
have been planned with alfalfa; 20
with soybeans; 26 with lime; 3 with
oats (treating for smut) ; 5 with oats
(spraying for kale), and 8 with hay
(topdressing with chemicals). Every
town In the county has one or more
demonstrations. A few more demon
strations will be arranged with soy
beans and a few more with spraying
oats for kale.
The county" sprayer will be confin
ed to the towns of Danville, Walden,
Hardwick and Stannard. At least
two demonstrations will be conducted
In each town to show the effect of
spraying oat fields with sulphate of
iron to eradicate kale. It would pay
a farmer or a group of farmers in
every community to own a sprayer,
which could be used for spraying po
tatoes as well as for spraying to erad
icate kale.

My dear Capt. Griswold:
On May 11th, at the regular month

ident submitted a communication re
citing briefly the business reverses of
Capt. E. F. Griswold of St. Johnsbury,
Vt., a former Union officer, who since

General expressions of regret and
sympathy followed from members of
the board and It directed that senti
ments of its regret be sent to the gen
erous donor and friend through the
president, and also to request Capt.
Griswold to allow It to return his last
unused check.
In obeying, therefore, my dear sir,
the wishes of the Board, I beg to
again thank you for all your kindness,
which must In the heart of every true
man touch a generous responsive
chord, and with some diffidence to ask
you to accept the check. We hope
that your future years may be long

lections of manly and generous deeds
done in the flesh, and followed by an

Gates was well pleased with the ef
fort of Col. Ira L. Reeves to mobilize
the First Vermont Regiment of In
fantry Saturday at Norwich univer
sity. All companies were present ex
cepting those of Springfield, Burling
ton and Brattleboro. The work dem
onstrated that automobiles can be
used to a great advantage in prepar
edness and brought out several points
that Col. Reeves wanted to know In
conjunction with the support which
the towns are giving the companies in
different parts of the state, also that
in some instances cars had to be over
loaded because there were not enough
of them, while in others there was a
sufficiency of cars. Having mobilized,
the regiment was given an opportun
ity to see what the cadets ccn do in
drilling, one of the features being
steeple chasing, which resulted tn
men getting thrown, although no In
juries occurred. Ex-Gov. Allen M.
Fletcher was present.
