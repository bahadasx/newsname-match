MAKES A GET-AWAY FROM THE
STREET GANG, BURGLARIZES
THE POLICE STATION AND FI
NALLY LANDS IN JAIL.
Chief of Police Bob Hutchins had
one "slipped to him" a few days ago
and was only able to play even yes
terday when officer Slmnis re-captured
the one who violated his confidence
and turned him over to the county of
ficials who will investigate a charge
of grand larceny.
A few days ago the police arrested
a man with a lot of brass and junk
in his possession. He was unable to
give a very satisfactory account of
himself, so was locked up, and the
junk deposited In the store room at
the station. He was fined pretty
heavily and given a sentence on the
streets, but he was so worthies and
Bo account that the officials encour
aged him to make a get away.
'He took advantage of their gener
osity, but instead of hitting the pike
out of town, returned to the station,
stole the junk that he had in storage
there, sold it and with the money pur
chased transportation to Berwyn.
Temptation seemed to lurk in his path
and he is now in the county jail charg
ed w ith stealing a couple of large belts
from one of the cotton gins in that
place.
Bob Hutchins says that he is glad
to be rid of this individual, but is of
fering perfectly good money to find
out how he got back into the station
and stole'the stuff that went to pur
chase a ticket to the little city of Ber
wyn where he got in real bad. Uncle
Tony, the day sergeant, is a light
sleeper and ho, too, is wonderiftg how
he got by with it, but he did, and !:i
all probability will be the guest of
the county until he is turned over to
the state.

FEDERAL BUILDING PLEASES HIM
Warden Dick Says Ardmore postoffbe
Is Delight to the Eye.
Warden Dick of the state prison
was here today from McAlester and
left on the afternoon train for Okla
homa City, where he goes on busi
ness. Mr. Dick looked over the fed
eral building under construction -it
the corner of Broadway and North
Washington and was greatly pleased
with the structure. He said it was
as far above the building at Mc
Alester as the moon was above the
earth. It is a larger structure, it is
higher and much better in appear
ance. He says the Ardmore building
especially the brick portion of the
structure will look just as good a
century from now as it looks today.
He is of the opinion that Ardmore
has been very fortunate in getting
such a federal building.

SENATOR 01!
IS FAVORED BY
THE PRESENT
NOT IMPROBABLE THAT OKLAHO
MAN WILL BE NOMINEE FOR
VICE PRESIDENT AT ST. LOUIS
CONVENTION.
Men who are conservative and who
are watching closely the trend of po
litical events, are of the opinion that
U. S. Senator Robert L. Owen will
be nominated at St. Louis as the
running mate of Wood row Wilsou.
And it is said that the senator from
Oklahoma will accept that nomination
if it Is offered him. Vice presidents
are not renominated and while Mar
shall has been faithful as an execu
tive, it is not probable that lie will
be before the convention. Those who
are in a position to know, state that
Woodrow Wilson will indicate his
choice to the convention and that
choice will bo Senator Owen. He ha3
been the leader in the senate, he has
carried the burden of the administra
tion in that body and he has done his
part well. In all emergencies the pres
ident lias learned to lean upon his
strong arm more than upon any other
man In the senate. The senator
would not resign from the United
States senate in case of his nomina
tion until after his election aud that
would place the appointment f his
successor in the hands of Governor
Williams. - That would bring on anoth
er chapter in Oklahoma politics tha.t
would be interesting.
GERMANS EXECUTE MURDERESS

MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD
OF AGRICULTURE WHO WAS IN
THE CITY SAYS THIS SECTION
IS INDEED FORTUNATE.
R. D. McManus who is with the
state board of agriculture, has recent
ly made a trip through the north
western portion of the state. He says
that in Blaine, Beckham, Roger Mills,
Kllis, Majors, Alfalfa, Woods and
Woodward counties the oat crop is cut
at least one half, and that very little
wheat will be raised. Lack of rain
hindered the growth of the plants and
the green bugs attacked the oats and
destroyed what remained of the crop,
and the green bug3 seriously injured
the wheat crop. In Kingfisher, Gar
field, Grant, Noble, Logan and Kay the
crop has been injured to some extent
both by lack of rain and the green
bugs. In southwestern Oklahoma the
crops are doing much better. A rain
visited a portion of Beaver and a por
tion of Harper counties wfiich saved
the grain crops in the area visited by
the rain.
Coming Here for Grass. I
Lack of rain at Toyah, Tex., has J
marie the grass scarce this spring.
and a car of stock horses from Tucker j

JURY AFTER TWO MINUTES' DE
LIBERATION FAIL TO FIND THE
PLAINTIFFS HAVE JUST CAUSE
TO COLLECT DAMAGES.
The Jury in the case of John Davis,
et al., vs. Hickman Willis was out of
the room about two minutes yester
day when they returned with a verdict
in favor of the defendant lio was
contesting a $00,000 damage suit insti
tuted by the plaintiffs' through their
attorneys Sigler and Howard. The de
fendant, Hickman Willis is a prisoner
at the state penitentiary where he
was sent to serve a 2 year sentence
for killing Rena Davis, August 14,
1914. Tlio plaintiffs endeavored to
show that Rena Davis, their mother
was their sole support while the de
fense was able to establish to tho sat
isfaction of the jury that such was
not the case, but on the other hand
she was practically dependent herself.
Hickman Willi took his allotment of
land from the government near Ileald
ton in tills county and it afterward de
veloped that it was some of the richest
oil producing land in the field. It is
cstimtaed that Willis has a daily in
come of approximntt :y ?1."0 from his
royalties, which is being taken care of
by the government pending his release
fiom the penitentiary.
Willis was 'brought here from Mc
Alester to testify in the case, and
while confined in the county jail ho
;.ad his mcahj sent from the hotel. It
is reported that he Is a model pris
oner and will get a lot of "good time"
off of his sentence. Willis, in a drunk
en frenzy killed the Davis woman
near Provence on the date above
named. When sober, lie was consid
ered docile, but when drinking was ir
responsible. When released, he will
be one of the wealthiest men in the
county. H. If. Brown and J. B. Moore
represented Willis in the 'Case.
ISSUE IN CON
TEMPLATION SEWERS AND WATER MAINS
MUST BE EXTENDED TO MEET
THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE
CITY, SAYS LASHER.
"The time has arlrved when the cit
izen of this city might as well begin
to consider another bond issue for the
purpose of extending the sewer and
water mains" said Commissioner Lash
er this morning, when the question
of supplying many requests for this
service was under discussion. Mr.
Lnsher states that the city has grown
so rapidly that the sewers and water
mains have not kept pace with it, and
every day property owners who have
erected residences outside the sewer
and water district are demanding that
they be given the service.
People are a trifle skittish of any
mention of a bond issue in the city at
the present . time, but according to
Commissioner Lasher it. is a condition
that has to be met one way or the
other, and bonds are the only solu
tion. A trip over the outskirts of tho
city will verify Mr. Lasher's state
ment that the city is growing rapidly
and apparently it is but the matter of
a very short time before these con
ditions will have to be met or the
growth win stop because people are
not apt to invest their money , in
houses that they are unable to con
nect with the sewers and water main.
Perhaps this question will be submit
ted to the people in a few weeks, at
any rate it will have to be before very
long if Ardmore expects to expand ac
cording to the comoiissioner.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY LINEBAUGH)
HAS DONE GREAT SERVICE TO
INDIAN TERRITORY ANOTHER
COURT NEEDED.
Hon. P. H. Linebaugh, United
States district attorney for the east
ern district of Oklahoma, is here on
some matters connected with his of
fice. Mr. Linebaugh has been a very
busy man since he became a federal
official, and at this time his office
force is short on account of threo
of his men being in St. Paul, whx-ro
important cases are being tried in tho
appellate court.
Mr. Linebaugh has done the India
Territory portion of the state a good
service in clearing the dockets of
many of the land suits which have
burdened the dockets and clouded the
titles to many acres of land. In less
than two years he has disposed of lfi,
000 of these suits and the 7,000 cases
still pending he hopes to have off
the docket by the first of the year.
He has rendered this portion if he
state so great a service that he U
being talked for governor in the next
election. He has been faithful wltli
what has been intrusted Into his
hands, and it Is not at all improbable
that the people of the state who-n ho
is serving will give him greater
things to rule over.
Mr. Linebaugh states that the east
ern district is swamped with work.
Despite the strenuous work of Jud'e
Campbell his court is two years be
hind with its work. He is of the opin
ion that the southern district of Ok
lahoma should be created, and that it
should comprise the Chickasaw and
Choctaw nations.
In this connection Congressrian
Bill Murray of the fourth district ha3
a bill now pending which has for P.a
object the creation of a new fedr.l
district in the state, and Mr. Lln
baugh believes this bill should be
combined with the bill providing for
the establishing of the tenth circuit
court of appeals, comprising Okla
homa, Arkansas, Tennessee and the.
northern districts of Alabama and
Mississippi, and naming OWani:i
City, Little Rock and Memphis as
I court towns.
