nomic situation in Mexico ia ex
tremely grave, according to official
advices to the State Department.
With tho monetary problem already
acute, the food shortage in Mexico

While reports as to the domestic
situation of tho Carranza govern
ment are gloomy, the attitude of
Mexican officials towards the United

friendly since the border military

Voling Attorney Fires Fatal Shots
Without Provocation.
Elberton, Ga., May 21.-Sheriff S.
N. Hailey was shot and hilled by Ar
old Worley in the lobby of the court
house about noon to-day. Worley ls
a son of Judge J. N. Worley and re
cently succeeded his father as city
attorney. Mr. Halley was recently
nominated to succeed himself as she
riff. Halley ?was jailer as well as she
riff.
Worley was taken to Athens im
mediately after the shooting. He gave
himself up to Policeman C. W. John
son.
Difticulty Over Prisoner.
Sunday morning about 11 o'clock
two deputies from Anderson and She
riff Hailey went to the Seaboard rail
road depot and arrested a negro, who
was thought to be wanted in Ander
son. They started back to tho court
house, where another Anderson ne
gro was waiting, who had been taken
to Liberton to identify thc other
negro. On the way to the court house
the arrested negro . passed a lie to
Sheriff Hailey and he slapped the ne
gro.
Mr. Worley saw this and repri
manded the sheriff, telling him, lt is
stated, that he had better cut it out.
The sheriff replied that he was at
tending to his business and that he
(Worley) had better go on about his.
Worley ls said to have replied that be
would make it his business. j
Reproached by Sheriff.
According to the reports, nothing
more was seen of Worley for about
half an hour. While Sheriff Halley,
Deputies Sanders and Williams, C. W.
Johnson, assistant chief of police; a
Mr. Brock and two othor men were
sitting in the court house, Worley
walked up to within about three feet
Of Sheriff Halley. Tho sheriff arose
and told Worley that he did not see
the reason for Worley's conduct ear
lier in tho day. Worley, it is stated,
then pulled his pistol, fired twice at
close range and began backing to
ward the door. He continued to shoot,
lt is reported, three more shots bel: g
fired, but none of these taking effect.
Although mortally wounded, Sheriff
Hailey fired at Worley thiee times as
he was going out of the door. None
of these shots took effect.
Halley soon expired, one of the bul
lets having entered his left side just
below the heart.
In a very short time Worley start
ed back into the court house, but
was met by Deputy Sheriff Sanders,
who told him that he must not enter.
Policeman Johnson came up about
this time and placed Worley under
arrest. He was carried to the city
jail, but many people began to gather
and since there was talk of violence
he was carried to Athens.
Hailey had been sheriff of Elbert
county for the past several years and
was only recently re-elected for four
more years. He was very highly re
spected and it is said he was a splen
did officer. Worley ls a young man
about 30 years of age, and a member
of the bar in Elberton.
No other reason for tue act is
known except that related above
Germans Make Derided Gains.
Berlin, May 21.-More than 1,300
French, including 31 officers, 1G ma
chine guns and 8 cannon, were cap
tured In a new German assault on the
Verdun front, in the region of Dead

to-day. The statement says the Ger
man lines were advanced on the south
and southwest slopes of tho hill.
Tlie French Admission.
Paris, May 21.-Tho battle for pos
session of important strategic posi
tions on the Verdun front'west of the
Meuse river continued with unabated
severity last night. The French war
olllce announced this afternoon that
the Germans, although repulsed in
most of their attempts, succeeded In
capturing a first line trench on Dead
Man Hill and gaining ground on the
slopes west of the hill.
Crouch Report DoiiRunioiit Capturo.
Paris, May 23.-'Recapture by the
French, after three months, of the
greater part of Fort Douaumont,
which was taken by tho Germans at
tho outset of their Verdun drive, Is
received with great' elation by tho
press and public, the more so on ac
count of tho effect it is expected to
have on neutrnl opinion.
Gen. Nivelle, the French com
mander at Verdun, took advantage of
tho fact that the Germans recently
have been concentrating all their at
tention on Dead Man Hill, on the
other side of tho river, and assem
bled a large amount of artillery for
tho attack on Douaumont sector.
On Sunday Gen. Nivelle began a
heavy artillery attack on Fort Dou
futmont and adjacent positions. The
hour Axed for tho Infantry assault
was 4.30 p. m. yesterday. When the
moment came French Infantry, which
had been carefully selected and train
ad, began the advance, singing the
"Marseillaise."
The German resistance at some
points was stubborn. On the Froide
Torre road and at Douaumont the
French had to force hack tho Ger
man infantry inch by inch at the
point of tho bayonet. The leading
French contingents reached Fort
Douaumont nt 5 o'clock. Thoy killed

WHAT llEOOMES OF "LICKER ?"
A Corrcs|?on<Ieiit Makes Inquiry AH to
Disposition of Seized Rooze.
Walhalla, Route 2.-Editor Keo
.wec Courier: Pienso allow me space
in your columns to ask. What 'be
comes of all this "licker" that has
been seized of late? The law says,
"Pour lt out!" but 1 am inclined to
bellove lt is poured down.
The man who calls himself, or rep
resents himself to be a "bird"-all
he lacks, in my estimation, to bo a
pig ls to have a "snout and tail."
D. H.
Where the "Licker" Coes.
For the information of the public,
on receipt of the above Inquiry last
Wednesday morning, we made In
quiry rs to "where the licker goos"
that is captured every now and then
from illegal handlers of it, and wo
give 'telow the results of our Inquiry:
According to tho nature of tho
case, seized liquor is held for thirty
days ordinarily, and is then poured
out In the street in front o? the coun
ty juli. Sometimes, however, if par
tics give notice of intention to claim
the "wet goods" it is held temporarily
longer in order to avoid complica
tions.
In one case recently a small quan
tity of liquor was seized in the woods
somo distance from any residence,
and lhere was no chance of proving
whose liquor it was, and in such
caBes tho liquor is destroyed on tho
spot and the oincers go on their way
sooking other illicit whiskey.
Tho most recent disposition of
seized liquor took place In front of
tho county jail on the morning of
Tuesday, May 9th, when a few gal
lons were disposed of by pouring Into
the stjeet in front of tho Jail build
ing. ?
Tho next will take place at the
same locality on Friday afternoon of
this week nt 2 o'clock, when all that
ls properly subject to destruction will
bo poured out. The public ls "cor
dially Invited to attend" the pouring
If they so desire.
Concerning the recent capture of
liquor In the town of Seneca wo find
that tlic arresting officers, being nt
work within tho jurisdiction of the
town of Seneca, turned tho liquor
over to the Seneca authorities, who
will doubtless dispose of it properly
in due course of time. After the
Seneca authorities had handled tho
parties from whom this liquor was
seized, preliminary hearing was
waived by the defendants, and the
case will come up for hearing at th'
Court ol' General Sessions. Sonn
times the captured liquor is held as
a "material witness" in the cases,
and under such circumstances the de
I lay In destroying the stuff is longer
than ordinarily is the case.
? In the matter of the seizure of
some 20 gallons of liquor on a bridge
near Seneca, disposition is at pres
ent uncertain. lt may be turned
over to the Federal officers If, as is
suspected nt the present, tho Internal
tax thereon has not been paid. So
soon as this question ls decided defi
nitely, Just so soon will the fate of
this bunch of "licker" bo determined.
If tho Federal government releases
all claim to lt, then lt will be de
stroyed by the capturing officers.
lt occurs at times that tho authorl
! ties of the town of Walhalla make
seizures of liquor. In these Instances,
so soon as the caso is disposed of, if
there is a conviction of the parties,
the chlof of (police turns tho liquor
over to the Sheriff. In no cane has
the liquor ever been taken to the
Jail, hut when it is turned over by
the chief of police it ls Immediately,
and publicly, in front of the town
hall, destroyed by pouring il Into the
street.
Against Female Preachers.
Orlando, Fla., May 20.-Efforts to
further the interests of women to the
extent that they would be allowed to
preach in Presbyterian churches fail
ed here to-day after a five-hour de
bato at tho General Assembly of tho
Southern Presbyterian church in tho
United States.
Interest was keen during to-day's
discussion, which ended In che vote of
132 to 80 in favor of al owing the
status of women as regards preaching
to remain as it ls.
The vote upheld the majority re
port of tho committee to which the
question had been referred. A mi
nority report favored allowing wo
men to preach.
to tho rear a large number of pris
oners.
When they recovered from their
surprise the Germans launched a
number of fire counter-attacks, but
all failed and by 10 p. m. prepara
tions had been completed to deal
with the serious efforts tho Ger
mans are expected IO make to recap
ture the lost positions.
Tho French success ls considered
by military critics hore to have
shaken tho whole German lino at
Verdun.
Admit Partial Success.
Rerlln, May 23.-Announcement
was made by tho war office to-day
that In the fighting north of Verdun
tho iFrench have taken some first line
positions of the Gormans, 'but that
Fort Douaumont remains firmly in
German hands.
