Frank B. Kellogg Addressed
Audience at Willmar
Friday Night.
Mr. Kellogg prefaced his speech
with a few remarks about Willmar
and himself. He said he had respond
ed to the call of the editors of the
state to become a candidate for U. S.
Senate much against his own inclina
tions, for he doubted if the people
wanted to send a man to the U. S.
Senate who has had no previous ex
perience in public office.
The speaker then launched into the
preparedness issue. He showed how
unable we were to cope with the Mex
ican situation, and our great humilia
tion on account of it. Our people had
been invited to go into Mexico and
develop the country by the Mexican
government, and the inference the
speaker left was that we should pro
tect them there in their rights. But
he did not urge intervention, and
stated that this country did not wish

Frank B. Kellogg, candidate for the
Republican nomination for U. S. Sen
ator from Minnesota, addressed a fair
sized crowd in the court room of the
county court house in the interest of
his candidacy last Friday evening He
•yoked but little enthusiasm, and the
spirit of the meeting was saved at
the close by an old fashioned stump
speech by Ex-Congressman Frank M.
Eddy, who has lost none of the pun-men,
sent wit and humor for which he is
well known in this section.
The meeting was called to order
soon after eight o'clock. The Citizens'
__ Band gave a concert at the foot of
Fourth street, and marched to the
court house, where it continued to
play until after the meeting was un
der way.
There was a sprinkling of farmers,
and out-of-town people who had been
attracted to the meeting. Some-one
claims to have counted noses and
found 1S3 voters present. However,
it was a good representative crowd
that filled the main seating sections
in pretty good shape. State Senator
P. A. Gandrud presided and introduc
ed the speakers with -very brief state
ments. He referred to Mr. Kellogg
as one of the distinguished citizens
the State.

wanted no depen-
dence **(y cannot be assimiliated
into citu ship. He would content
himself with patrolling the Mexican
border. General Funston needs 25,000
men in Arizona alone for this pur
pose.
In regard to danger from European
countries Mr. Kellogg said that the
Uallipolli campaign proved that large
bodies of troops could be carried long
distances and be landed on hostile
shores, although the superiority of the
military preparedness of the Turks
had driven theni oft in that instance.
He stated the oceans do not isolate
us now as formerly, but later said the
isolation by oceans prevents any dan
ger from militarism in this country.
Our navy has not a ship nor a sin
gle submarine fit to oppose an in
vader. Why have a navy at all, if not
a good one? Not a single aeroplane
ht for duty, while Japan has four
thousand. The speaker finally made
an estimate that this country needs
an army of from 250,000 to 400,000
and a big navy, which is the
country's first line of defense. The
cost would be so slight that no one
would notice it.
The speaker did not think there was
any immediate danger threatening
from Europe or Mexico, but did think
that we should prepare to fight Japan.
He baid that country is preparing to
force us to accept Oriental people on
an equality with other races.
Mr. Kellogg spoke in favor of a
merchant marine. "What would you
think of a farmer who depended on his
neighbor to haul his grain to market,"
he said. But like on the preparedness
issue the speaker was very lame in
suggesting a remedy. By inference we
were led to believe that he favored
subsidies.
Mr. Kellogg spoke of the great Re
publican policy of protection, not for
the trusts, of course, but only for the
laboring men and especially for the
farmers. He cited instances, how
ever, where he himself, had stood
guard, to prevent the country from
getting too much protection.
He said he would be very proud to
receive the votes of our people and
take the place by the side of Knute
Nelson.
Ex-Congressman Eddy's speech was
more enthusiastically received. His
witty sallies were applauded. He
spoke of the necessity of parties to
good government, and of the necessity
of wearing a party label in Congress
in order to get committee assign
ments. The committees make the
laws. As far as figures go, they us
ually mean nothing. He told of an in
stance where one of the best Repub
lican speeches* and one of the best
Democratic speeches of a session were
written by the same hired profession
al speech writer and he had used the
same figures in both speeches. He
closed in the usual stump speaker's
style. The Republican party was
good, and the Democratic-**4su bad)
achievement vs. negation, etc.
Kellogg was the first of the four
candidates for the Republican nomi
nation to visit Willmar. Eberhart,
Clapp and Lindbergh are yet to be
heard from.

SENIORS ENTERTAINED BY
JUNIOR CLASS OF HIGH SCHOOL
Annual Reception and Banquet Took
Place Last Friday Evening at
Carlson Hall.
The annual banquet given by the
junior class of the high school in hon
or of the seniors, was held last Fri
day evening at Carlson Hall, and was
a most enjoyable affair. The rooms
were tastily decorated with pennants
and the colors of the two classes. The
following menu was served Fruit
cocktail, creamed chicken on rosettes,
mashed potatoes, creamed peas,
pickles, buns, 1917 salad, wafers, ice
cream, cake, salted nuts and coffee.
A splendid program of musical num
bers and toasts was given with Walt
er Erickson, president of the junior
class, acting as toastmaster.
The first number was a selection by
the junior-senior boys, after which
John Dale of the juniors, welcomed
the guests of honor in his own inim
itable way, by means of an original
poem. Clarence Bnglund, president
of the seniors responded in a fitting
manner.
Misses Hazel and Bernice Peterson
then rendered a piano duet, which was
followed by appropriate remarks oy
Miss Fern Doremus and Miss Frances
Kelly, two members of the high school
faculty who will not return next year.
A piano solo by Geraldine Haley was
thoroly enjoyed, as was the toast by
Ruth DeLaHunt, on "High School
Days". Miss Lange spoke on "Oppor
tunity," and Mr. Foster had as his
subject, "As Others See Us," and
needless to say both topics were ably
handled. The last toast was given by
Evelyn Anderson, the topic being
"Auld Lang Syne." Another selection
by the junior-senior boys brought the
program to a close.
Mesdames James Sanderson, I. T.
Cramer and Minnie Larsen had charge
of the banquet, which was enough to
insure its being the best obtainable.
COSMOS CLUB MEMBERS
BANQUET A INTERLACHEN
Rain of Last Sunday Fails to Spoil
Fun for Members of Club
at the Lake.
In spite of the rain which fell
steadily almost the entire day, last
Sunday, the second annual banquet of
the Cosmos Club was held at the In*
terlachen Hotel, Green Lake. The
trip was made by auto, the cars leav
ing between two-thirty and four o'
clock. The banquet was served at six
thirty, thirty-nine persons partaking
thereof. Following a few preliminary
remarks by the president, as to the
occasion, etc., and a short talk by
Thomas Phalen, of Sioux Falls, S. D.,
who way present for-the event? the
members fell to with a vengeance and
more than did justice to the splendid
"feed" served by Mrs. Larson. The
menu included fruit cocktail, fried
fish and escalloped potatoes, pickled
beets, rolls, roast veal, mashed pota
toes and brown gravy, white and
brown bread, dill pickles, jelly, fruit
salad, ice cream and cake, and coffee.
The affair was a most enjoyable one,
the-only drawback being the lack of
co-operation by the weather man, in
furnishing a day suitable for an out
ing at the lake.
The enthusiasm shown however, by
those present more than made up for
the poor weather conditions, and ev
eryone enjoyed himself to the fullest
degree. The log cabin was utilized
to a good purpose, with a fire roaring
in the big fireplace, everyone was
made to feel perfectly at home.
One or two of the more venture
some persons present tried their hand
at fishing, Obbie Nordstrom landing
two dandy pike, while Carl Hook(ed)
a few himself.

YOUNG MEN'S MEET
ING AT COURTHOUSE
Meeting Meit MudaytoDis
cuss MflitoCttttHyiiJ
The Committee appointed by the
Commercial Club to inyestigate the
proposition of organizing an Indepen
dent Company of Militia, with the ob
ject in view of securing an armory
for Willmar, has been at work quiet
ly during the past few days formulat
ing plans and now wishes to announce
that on Monday evening, May 29, ev
ery man who is interesting in hear
ing about the matter is requested) to
meet in the Court Room at the Court
House.
At this preliminary meeting every
young man who will seriously con
sider the matter of actually enlisting
in this Company is particularly urged
to be present, for every question that
anyone may have to ask, and an out
line of the requirements of enlistment
will be discussed as ably as the Com
mittee may be able to do.
The enlistment of a sufficient num
ber of men to form a Company is the
first essential step in securing an Ar
mory, therefore if there is enough en
thusiasm and interest shown at this
meeting to really organize, the Com
mittee can then take further steps at
once. This is the time to act, for
other companies will be bidding for
the vacant places, and then action
will be delayed a long time.
It has been suggested that if a large
enough number enlist that they march
as a company in the parade on Decor
ation Day.
In addition to any advantages that
may come from the training in mili
tary affairs, the plan of the Commit
tee includes the installing of all such
gymnasium features as the amount of
money raised may be able to purchase.
Therefore it should receive the en*
couragement of every public spirited
citizen who would like to see a build
ing in Willmar where our young men
can spend their time in a profitable
as well as pleasurable way.
It is said that more than half the
members of the State Militia are boys
from the country. The young men liv
ing within reach of Willmar are in*
vited to come.
