GARTER. HIS II BLANK,
HERS, A STRANGER ill
IRE HEAR! OF BISBEE
Disappearing Y.M.C.A. Boys'
Secretary Appears and Dis
appears Before Friends Can
Reach Him.
FACE IS WHISKERED
PREVENTING IDENTITY
Seen Many Times on Streets
This Week, Yet Hundreds
in Searching Party Comb
District in Vain for Him.
His mind a blank, even the
memory of bis own name gone, L.
R. Carter, boys' secretary of the
Bisbee Y. M. C. A., who mysteri
ously dropped out of sight in El
Paso three weeks ago, is reported,
aimlessly 'wandering about the .
streets of Bisbee today, bearded
and with hat pulled over his eyes
a stranger to the hundreds of.
friends who pass him.
No less than a dozen boys and
men identified him on the street
this week, but always he dropped
out of their view before they could
- catch up with him.
Last night a hundred women,
men and boys together with offic
ers con.bed the cities of the Dis
trict for him, searching every ..
nook far into the night but with- ;
out the barest trace of him.
Seen Often In Bisbee
Carter was first recognized by T. H.
Wilson of Buxton and Smith in front
of the Bank of Bisbee Tuesday after
noon. At that time his disappearance
had not been announced, and Smith
thought no more of the meeting ex-
cr-pt to note Cprter wore a blue serge
suit, a gray cap and a heavy growth
of whiskers.
On Wednesday he was reported in
the vicinity of the high school by a
schooltoy named Robert Pettijolin,
who again taw him near the Copper
Queen hotel that night. Pettijohn's
story 'is supported by another boy
who came running up to him saying
that he had juft seen Mr. Carter at.
the entrance to Brewery Gulch.
Friday night Carter was reported
in Lowel! ty Johnny Barutte, while
last night he was recognized by Abie
Nichols, George Brown and by Russell
Wripht, all boys who trainel under
him at tbV-Y M.'C. A. and knew him
intimately.
In, all cases were the descriptions
of hi:n the same, blue serge and gray
cap, in which Secretary Richardson
Baid Carter started for El Paso Sep
tember 1.
Carter's disappearance was first an
nounced early the past week after
numerous searching parties had been
sent to El Paso and other border
towns to search for him.
Left Here Sept. 1
On September 1, he kissed his bride
goodbye and started for El Paso for
a few days' rest, after a rigorous sea
son establishing Y. M. C. A. all over
the border. Two weeks ago Mrs. Car
ter received a letter from him in El
Paso, saying that he would soon be
back at work again, much refreshed
ty his vacation.
That was the last ever heard from
him.
Ten days ago his wife could bear
the suspense no longer and Mr. Rich
ardson, secretary or the "Y" set out
for El Paso to search for him. The
officers of all the towns along the bor
der were also requested to keep a look
out for him, but Richardson returned
without the least assurance that Car
ter had even been in El Paso.
No Cause Known
Carter was married to a Bisbee girl
only a few months ago and their do
mestic life was serene, and he was
succeeding well in his .chosen work,
when he was assigned the important
task of establishing Y. M. C. As a
mong the soldier camps along the bor
der.
For weeks then. Carter worVed day
and night, and came back to Bisbee a
month ago ill from his undertaking.
Foul Play Theory Given Up
The strangeness of his disappear
ance caused many of his best friends
and Mrs. Carter to believe he must
have been the victim of foul play. But
word that he had been seen In Bisbee
has brought hope that he may now
be found and his mind restored to
him. Physicians consulted last night
said from the description of the case 1

tion. NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 23.
Decision as to where the American
Mexican joint commission shall con
tinue its conferences after next week
has been left to Ambassador Arredon
do, representing Mexico, and Win.
Phillips, third assistant secretary of
state, it was learned tonight. It will
be necessary to move because the ho
tel where sessions have been held here
will close October 1. Atlantic City,
Lakewood, White ' Sulphur Springs,
and Garden City are among the plac
es suggested.
An early termination of the confer-
ences
could be reached if the Ameri-
can commissioners were willing to
agree to the chief desire of General
Carranza's representatives, which is
the withdrawal from Chihuahua of the
American troops, but the American
.commissioners have made it clear
that any agreement must be based on
the conviction that conditions war
ranted the change.
The net results of the three weeks
conference is that the Americans have
added graatly to their store of infor
mation relative to Mexican affairs,
and that they have endeavored to con
vince the Mexican representatives
that whatever the United States has
done with regard to Mexico, was not
done because of selfish motives.
General Carranza's objection to con
tinued discussion of Mexico's internal
affairs has not prevented a somewhat
exhausted study of the economic and
financial affairs of that country-

LONDON, Sept. 24. One German
airship, and probably another, was
brought down during a raid over the
eastern coast of England and the out
skirts of London last night, according
to an official statement. One airship
was brought down in the southern
part of Essex and it is reported fell
on the Ejsex coast.
No reports of casualties or damage
have been received. The text of the
statement follows:
' An attaf k by hostile airships was
made on Lincolnshire and the eastern
(onnties and on the outskirt of Lon
don. The latter attack was made
from the northeast and the southeast
about midnight, and was beaten off
by our anti-aircraft defenses.
"One airship was brought down In
flames, in southern part of Essex and
a report has been received that an
other fell on tble Essex coast. The
latter report hitherto is unconfirmed
No reports of casualties or damage
has yet been received."
The raiders rpparently did not come
so near to London rs on the occasion
of the destruction' of. the L-21 on Sep
tember 3. The sound of gun fire was
fainter when tie distant reports of
anti-aircraft weapcr.s shortly after
midnight heralded the approach of the
raiders. Observers on the roofs and

onlookers, still taking a sporting in
