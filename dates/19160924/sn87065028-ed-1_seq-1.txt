Members.
Th fiscal year of the Chamber of
Commerce of Columbus urn Lowndet
County beitins October 1, and the
members will meet at the headquar
ters of the organization in the First
State Bank building next Tuesday
night at 8 o'clock, when officers for
the ensuing biennial period will le
elected. In holding this election the
referendum plan will be adhered to,
letters having been sent out to all
members requesting them to nomi
nate a candidate for each office that
is to be filled. There are ten officers
to be elected; a president, a vice
president and ten directors, and in
each instance the three candidate
receiving tho largest number of nom
inating ballots will be voted on, those
receiving the largest number of bal
lots at the meeting Tuesday night be
ing declared officially elected.
The members will not eject a secretary-manager,
as the constitution
and by-laws of the organization
clothe the directors with the' right
to name this official. Ever since
Mr. J. G. Weatherly tendered his
resignation as secretary several
weeks ago Miss Ella May Jordan
has been acting as secretary, and has
filled the position most acceptably,
having been in the employ of the civic
chamber for a long time vmd is
thoroughly familiar with the routine
work. It is necessary, however, that
the office of secretary be filled by a
man, and one of the first steps to be
taken by the directors which are to
be named Tuesday night will be the
election of a permanent secretary.
In the letters sent out by the civic
chamber "the following paragraph
giving advice to members regarding
-the nomination of candidates ap
pears: "Carefully consider all available
material in Columbus, and then fill
out below with the names of the men
who are your choice to hold the re
spective positions in the Chamber of
Commerce. Remember that the
Chamber has a serious work ahead
of it. Also remember that a "genial
fellow" or a "good mixer" will not
necessarily make an efficient presi
dent or a competent department
head. The Chamber of Commerce
snouw select men to responsible posi
tions because of their fitness and
aptitude."

to the weekly crop bulletin issued
by the weather bureau today. The
bulletin adds that most of the tobac

Tennessee has been housed and is
being cured.
"The weather was too cool for
cotton in North and South Caro

in the first named state was unsat

Washington, Sept. 23. During the

to enact an eight-hour basic work

rary expedient to avert the then
threatened tie-up of virtually every

urged him to vote for the then pend

thereafter Senator Williams began

Natchez, Miss., Sept. 23. Louis
retkovesek, aged 14, was burned to
death in the fire which at an early
hour Friday morning consumed the
large frame building on Briel ave
nue, occupied by his father, Lucas
Petkovsek, as a woodworking shop
and residence. The family occupied
the upper story of the building and
when they awoke from the crack
ling of the flames it was to find
themselves trapped. The father suc
ceeded in getting on the roof of a
gallery and leaped from there to the
ground. He secured a ladder and
succeeded in rescuing all the mem
bers of the family except his son.
Just as the boy appeared at the win
dow was enveloped in flames. The
fire had gained such headway that
it could not be extinguished and the
body was not found until several
hours later. Mr. Petovsek suffered
injuries from his leap to the ground
ana lis wne ana one ot his sons
were painfully burned. A quantity
of tools and machinery were lost, in
addition to the other contents of the
building. The total loss is estimated
at szu.uuu, witn very little insur
ance. Buildings of the Metcalf Coal
Company and others in the vicinity
were damaged. A strong wind was
blowing at the time of the fire,
which showered sparks in every di

that there would be a general con

day night at 10:30 o'clock at Glen

platform, with several tons of seed
and nearly 200 bales of cotton at
the big gin of Townes & Sturdivant,
wcte destroyed. Origin of the 'ire
is not known. The cotton and seed
were insured with the Delta Insur

on Wednesday sold 18 bales of cot
ton to Edward Holland of Green
wood, which was on the platform
ready for delivery. The insurance
policy was held by the buyers and
covered the loss. It could not be
definitely ascertained whether there
were more than the 185 bales noil
by Mr. Townes on the platform or
not.
The Reed houses and platform
were completely destroyed. The big
gin adjoining was saved from the
flames by the hardest efforts. Every
effort was made to extinguish the
flames when first discovered, but to

7 li MUSIC Of NECHO
Ti
TOM ATKINS AND SON RAISE
"ROUGH HOUSE" IN EAST
COLUMBUS.
As the result of their action in
breaking up a dance which was in
progress at a private residence in
East Columbus Friday night, Tom
Atkins and his son, Roy Atkins, both
of whom are machinists, were be
for Mayor Gunter yesterday, and
the elder man was fined $25 for dis
turbing the peace, while his son wa?
fined $20 on an assault charge and
for participating in, the disturbance.
According to testimony deduced
at the trial, Atkins, who resides near
the scene of the dance, became in
censed because a negro pianist was
employed to furnish the music, and
he and his son invaded the home for
the purpose of breaking up the en
tertainment. A general mixup fol
lowed, in which the younger Atkin
struck one of the guests a smart
blow in the face, and it was neces
sary to call in the police to quell the
disturbance.
It is said that a woman accom
panied Atkins and his son on thet
visit to the house, and that she gave
one of the lady dancers a smart slap
on the cheek. This lady, however.
declined to make a charge against
the alleged offender, and she was not
haled into court. At the trial the de
fendants were represented by At
torney Callaway & Storey. Hon
James Harrison appeared for the
prosecution.

JACKSON HK.Is. ' EXEC
UriVE COMMIiFE TO
MEET IN OCTOBER.
LOCAL COURSK IS
IN A FINK SHAPE
T. J. Locke, Jr., Loral Member
of Committee, Will Attemi
Meeting.
The executive committee of the
Jackson Memorial Hiehway Associa
tion is to meet in Nashville in Oc
tober fur the purpose of designating
the official route of the great thor
oughfare, and as the time for the
ommittee to assemble aprpoaches
ocal interest in the matter is con-
itantly increasing.
The contest will be between two
ontative route, one from NanviiU
to New Orleans via Huntsville, Mont
gomery and, Birmingham, and the
other via Florence, Columbus and
Meridian. This route, which is gen
erally known as the Jackson Military
Highway, is the one that people in
this section are working for and the
one which they earnestly desire to
see selected.
At a meeting in Nashville last fall
the executive committee decided
that the route which had most nearly
reached completion by October 1,
1916, would be officially designated
as the official course of the highway,
and it is believed that the route on
which Columbus is located is much
nearer completion than the compet-.
ng course. The route through this
county is in splendid shape, and, so
far as can be learned, the only
stretch of roadway on the route that
incomplete lies in Lamar county,
Ala. There was some dispute about
the route through Lamar county, but
this dispute was settled at a meeting
held in Vernon several weeks ago,
and the route finally selected is now
n progress.
Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., the local
member of the executive committee
of the Jackson Memorial Highway
Association, is now in New York, but
will reach Nashville in time to attend
the committee meeting. A party
made up of Mr. and Mrs. Locke and
Mr. and Mrs. S. B. Street, Jr., left
here several weeks ago for an auto
trip to the metropolis. They traveled
as far as Nashville over the proposed
Jackson Highway, and will return via
the same route.
Dr. Davis McCullough, of Aurora,
111., who since his graduation a year
ago from the inirago voiiege oi
Medicine and Surgery has been an
interne at the St. Charles Hospital
in Aurora, is spending several days
in Columbus with his parents, Dr.
and Mrs. J. D. McCullough.
ATTENDANCE IT COLLEGE IS
LiEEST IN ITS ASTON
MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED
STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY
MATRICULATED.
The attendance at the Mississippi
Industrial Institute and College has
broken all records, something over
900 students having already matric
ulated. The dormitories are crowd-
d to capacity, and many teaihers
and students have been compelled
to seek lodging in the boarding
houses which surround the insti
tion. The large attendance is somewhat
surprising, as tne college derives us
patronage largely from rural dis
triees, where boll weevil ravages
have materially reduced the cotton
yield. The farmers, however, seem
to have scraped together sufficient
funds to send their daughters here
in huge numbers, and the college is
apparently facing one of the most
prosperous years in its history.
