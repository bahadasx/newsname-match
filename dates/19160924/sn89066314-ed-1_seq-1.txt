The Missouri Student-Alumni Union
Is assured. It passed out of the class of
possibilities esterday when the board
of directors instructed the building
committee to obtain the Columbia
Club building for the use of the or
ganization. The directors met all day
yesterday in the Alumni Rooms, Aca
demic Hall.
Dr- Walter Miller, acting for the Co
lumbia Club, gave the consent of the
Club to release the building to the
I'nicn. After an investigation of the
terms of the lease and other legal
matters, the Columbia Club building
will become the home of the Missouri
Student-Alumni Union. The change
will be effected by October 1. The
Union will purchase the furniture of
the club. A formal opening probably
will be held some time during the first
part of next month.
A campaign was launched to raise
money by tho sale of life memberships
to alumni and former students of the
University. Life memberships cost

the Union under the plan of 100 con
tributors of tills sum begun last spring
by'C. B. Rollins.

David J. Owen was elected vice
president of the Union to fill the va
cancy left by Ray E. Miller, who is

To Employ Permanent Organizer.
Tho employing of a permanent or
gpnizer for the Union was discussed.
Such a man will be employed as soon
a the campaign warrants an addi
tion to tho working force. The di
rection of the campaign to raise $230
000 for a permanent Union building
will be in the hands of a central com
mittee which was appointed yester
day. The members of the committee
are Forrest Donneil, St. Louis; T. T.
Crittenden and R. B. Caldwell, Kan
sas City; A. Ross Hill and E. W.
Stephens. Columbia; members from
the alumni, and Don D. Patterson
from the student body.
it the women of the University taKe
sufficient interest In the Union and
become members, the board of di
rectors will provide temporary quar
ters for them. The Columbia Club
building will be used only for men, ac
cording to tho present plans.
A mass meeting of the student body
to organize the local support of the
Union and to plan for the campaign
in the' University will bo held soon
The students will co-operate with the
central committee in its campaign
among all University graduates and
former students.
"Union Will Help University."
"The new Student-Alumni Union is
to be a union of hearts," Charles B.
Paris, judge of the State Supreme
Court and member of the board of
directors of the Union, said. "We are
not looking forward to the building
of a $2."0.000 home for students and
alumni. The building will be merely
an accessory. The great feature of
the Union Is that of a closer relation
ship between every graduate, former
MU1H
student and student of the University
of Missouri. By this relationship and
co-operation the University can be
built Into one of the greatest educa
tional institutions in the United
States. It can be made Independent
of any political issues or parties."
The Union plan is destined to be
the University's greatest asset, T. T.
Crittenden declared. When the word
goes out oer the country that the
Missouri Student-Alumni Union is a
concrete body and that every student,
every member of the faculty and the
Board of Curators are members, there
will be many graduates and former
students support their alma mater, he
said. He also commended the plan
because of tho possibility of associa
tion upon common ground of the mem
bers of the University faculty and the
students.
"The members of the faculty are
anxious to meet the students outside
of the class room," President Hill
said, "We can meet them in small
groups and at receptions, but this is
not satisfactory for we want to meet
them all on a common ground. We
want to meet them in a place where
we will both be at ease and can chat
as man to man. I believe that the
students are as anxious to meet the
members of the faculty as we are to
meet them, but they do not know how
td accomplish such meetings.
"The Union solves this difficulty.
The plans for our permanent building
will include a cafeteria, rooms for stu
dent organization meeting, a dining
room, loafing rooms for women and
men. and guest rooms for the use of
visiting alumni and guests of the Uni
versity. In its social features it will
cover every necessity of student life.
I consider it the University of Mis
souri's greatest step forward."
A meeting of the central committee
of the Union will be held in St. Ixniis
next week. The Union will be incor
porated before the opening of the new
quarters. The active campaign will
be started immediately.
The members of the boird of di
rectors attending the meeting yester
day were: Robert B. Caldwell. Kansas

SIMPSON RAN SECOND
Fred Murray, California Star,'
Does High Sticks
in 14 2-5.
By United Press.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23. Fred Mur
ray, star hurdler of San Francisco,
is believed to have set a new world's
record for the 120-yard high hurdle
race today in the Athletic Club's meet
at Travers Island. Four watches
caught Murray at U:2-7,, which is one
f.fth of a second faster than the rec
ord made by Robert Simpson of the
University of Missouri- Simpson ran
second in the race won by Murray.
The meet at Travers Island today
was an exhibition affair between Simp
son, Murray, Meredith and Loomis.the
four A. A. U. stars who are to sail
for Northern Europe next week to
compete in athletic events in Sweden,
Denmark and Norway.
Coach Schulte said last night that
j esterday lie received a telegram
from Simpson stating that he would
run an exhibition race over the three
foot hurdles. Over the regulation
three-foot, six inch hurdles Murray's
best previous time Is fifteen seconds
and Schulte thinks it highly Improb
able that the Californian should clip
three-fifths of a second from his best
former time.
Simpson left Columbia Thursday
night and could not possibly have
reached New York before noont yes
terday. After a thirty-seven hour
trip it is probable that he was not in
the best condition for a race two hours
after leaving the train.
Schulte Is waiting for word from
Simpson himself.

12,000 TO KEEP ORDER
New York Police Preparing
for Strike Voted by
Union Leaders.
By United Pres.
-NEW YORIC Sept. 23. New York
waited with apprehension today for
the next turn in the labor war which
starts next Wednesday when the or
der for "general suspension of work"
becomes effective to make the largest
city of the world a city of dead indus
try. Developments of the past twenty
four hours have injected much bitter
ness into the labor situation develop
ing from the strike of the car men.
The general strike order interpreted
by union leaders today is merely a
notice to employers that union men
will not ride to work in cars run by
non-union men and guarded by police,
but they assert its effect will be a
complete tie-up of industry in the
greatest city through refusal to work
of nearly 800,000 union workers.
President Shonts of the Interbor
ough, the storm center of the fight,
announced today that the policy of
the company to deal with individual
employes and not with unions or un
ion leaders had not been ousted-
Shonts was under fire today for
recommendations which he made In a
circular address to the district at
torney and to individual members of
the grand jury, urging that body,
which is understood to have returned
five or six secret indictments for vio
lence in the strike, indict labor lead
ers for conspiracy. District Attorney
Swann announced that Shont's ac
tion invalidated any action tho pres
ent grand jury might take and that he
would be forced to call another
if the probe Into the strike is con
tinued. Will Have 12.000 Men to Keep Order..
By United Press.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23 Twelve
thousand men, including the regular
and extra police, will be on duty
next week to guarantee the preserva
tion of order if the general strike
of "suspension of work. ' voted yes
terday by the union leaders of the
city becomes effective.
Plans embracing measures for the
maintenance of order were drawn by
Police Commissioner Woods late to
day, but at the ,samc time he issued
.an open letter &, the public through
tne newspapers, declaring that the
renerai strike in support of traction
employes now seems imminent but
there is no reason for believing that
the walk-out will be followed by vio
lence. Governor Whitman arrived in New
assemblymen for nevt Monday to start
a movement Tor a special sess'on
of the legislature for the purpose of
enacting legislation that will bring
about a settlement in the labor war.

By United Press.
SHADOW LAWN. LONG BRANCH.
N. J., Sept, 23. In his first campaign
speech since his acceptance of the re
nomination, President Wilson declared
yesterday that he did not, as baa
been charged, push the Eight-Hour
Bill through Congress because the
railroad men demanded it, but "be
cause the eight-hour day is right,"
His address delivered to the busi
ness men of Trenton and several hun
dred others, was in direct reply to
attacks made on recent legislation by
the Republican candidate, Charles
Evan Hughes.
"Labor is not a commodity," said
the President. "It is a form of co
operation, and if I can make a man
believe in me, believe that I am just,
know what I want and know what I
want to share the profits of success
with him. I can get ten times as much
out of him as if he thought I were his
antagonist, and that his labor is
cheap at any price." The president's
speech was a discussion of American
business as well as of eight hour
legislation, but in the main, he launch
ed straight out with his reply to Mr.
Hughes' attacks, which he intimated
were "misleading."
Chihuahua Attack Affects Meeting.
By United Press.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 23.
Cafranza's apiarent failure to direct
an effective pursuit of the Villlsta
forces that attacked Chihuahua City
may radically effect the tentative
plans of the Mexico-American peace
conference for a border patrol.
The commissioners had practically
completed, their work In a plan for
border patrol when the Villlstas
struck. It called for co-operation fcy
Mexican troops with General Persh
ing's forces in patrolling the border
and was about ready for submission to
Washington and Mexico City.
The American commissioners do not
believe that General Trevino, the Car
ranzista commandant at Chihuahua,
used the proper tactics in pursuit of
Villa.
Re-Inforrements for Carranzlstas.
By United Press.
JUAREZ,, Sept- 23. Tho Carranzis
ta Garrison here Is being heavily re
inforced this afternoon. Three train
loads of cavalry from Chihuahua City
and points south went into camp.
These additions to forces already here
are believed to have been promoted
by the threat of Pancho Villa that he
would drive the Carranzlstas now at
Juarez into the Rio Grande.
According to arrivals from the
south this afternoon. Villa forces are
now encamped about twenty miles
outside of Chihuahua City, where they
have been since they evacuated the
city after their attack Saturday.
General Gonzales, Carranzlsta com
mander here, posted a decree that any
civilian found with arms or munitions
on his person or In his homo will be
summarily executed without the for
mality of a trial. This action was
taken for the purpose of preventing
sniping by sympathizers, in case of
an attack, as was done at Chihuahua
City in Saturday's raid.
