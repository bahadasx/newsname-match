ROUMANIANS REPULSED
The battle in the Dobrudja region
has broken out anew. The Russians
and Roumanians took the-offensive,
but failed to. make headway. One at­
tack was made on the right wing .if
the Central Powers south of Pev'to
parii and the other was on the left
wing to ther£anube. An unconfirmed
report by L,vay, of Rome says that
Field Marshal,., von Mackensen con­
tinues to retreat and the fortress o£
Silistria has been abandoned by his
troops.
Roumanians Thrown Back.
Roumanian attacks in Transylvania
continue, and Berlin reports the re­
pulse of two Roumanian divisions on
both sides of Herman-stadt. The Aus
tro-Germans also have recaptured
Vulcan Pass from the Roumanians.
There has been little activity on
the eastern front and in the Carpa­
thians. Petrograd records the re­
pulse of infantry assaults after gas
attacks southwest of Lake Naroczz,
and Berlin reports that Russian at­
tacks near Korynjtza, in Volhynia,
railed.
Tide Turns For Central Powers.
The ti(Je in Macedonia appears to
have turned in favor of the German
Bulgarian force's.'- TW Bulgarians
have taken Entente trenches between
Fiorina and Lake Presbina and have
repulsed attacks in the Vardar re­
gion. On the Belasica plain, between
the Struma and Strumnitza rivers,
the Entente forces, according to Ber­
lin, have evacuated the territory
southward to Kusa-Balkan, directly
behind the Struma.
Austrians Checked.
Austrian attacks in the Carso re­
gion in the lower Izzonso were check­
ed by the Italians, Rome reports. Ital­
ian trenches) on Hill 208, south of No
vavas, were penetrated, but the at­
tackers were driven out later. Aus­
trian attempts against Hill 144, north­
east of Monfalcone, also were repuls­
ed.

London, Sept. 24.—One German air­
ship and probably another was
brought down during a raid over the
eastern coast of England and the out­
skirts of London last night, accord­
ing to an official statement. One air­
ship was brought down on the outer
part of Essex and it is reported an­
other fell on the east coast.
No reports of casualties or damage
have been received.
The text of the statement ioliows:
"An attack by hostile airships was
made on Linconshire and the eastern
counties and on the outskirts of Lon­
don. The latter attack was made
from the northeast and southeast
about midnight and was beaten off by
our anti-aircraft defense.
"One airship was brought down in
flames in the southern part of Es­
sex and a report had been received
that another fell on the Essex coast."
The latter report, unconfirmed, fol­
lows
"No reports of damage or casualties
have been received as yet."

over England three weeks ago a Zep­
pelin was brought down in the Lon­
don district. The crew of the Zep

PAY N.D.N.a A
Inspection of Camp Mercedes Is
Made by U. S. Officials Say
First Is Best Regiment.
INSPECTIONMADE
ON SHORT NOTICE
Mercedes, Tex., Sept. 23.—Officers
and men of the First North Dakota
Infantry stationed at Mercedes, Tex­
as, received a high compliment Sat­
urday from high officers of the Reg­
ular U. S. Army, who made an in­
spection of the troops, the camp and
the clerical work of each company.
At the conclusion of the inspection,
whftfh was'a most rfcid~'unc, the
officers are reported to have made the
statement that they had never in­
spected a militia organization that
would come up to the North Dakota
Infantry, and that in many details,
they even were superior to many
regular army outfits.
This inspection was made on short
notice and it is surprising that such
a showing could be more when prac­
tically no time was allowed for pre­
paring for the inspection. At nine
o'clock Thursday night the North Da­
kota officers received word that their
entire organization should be in the
field with full equipment by eight the
next morning to undergo inspection
by officers of the Regular Army act­
ing under orders of the Inspector
General. Things moved likely at the
Dakota camp for a couple of hours
that night and the boys were out
before sun-up Friday morning, and
ready to take the field. They were
put through a stiff drill from eight
in the morning until one p. m., after
which the kitchens, mess halls, quar­
ters, sanitation and in fact the whole
camp was thoroughly inspected. The
inspectors found everything as slick
as could possibly be expected, and
not a piece of paper or any other
kind of trash was to be found on the
entire camp grounds.
The clerical work of each com­
pany was examined and in nearly
every instance the various accounts,
reports, etc. received the inspector's
O. K. This latter was especially
flattering as the system of bookkeep­
ing used in the Army is entirely dlf
ferent from that in any other line,
and it takes expert accountants some
time to become familiar with the
many different forms, and to be able
to wind and unwind the rolls of "red
tape" without getting them tangled.
Taken altogether the inspection
was highly pleasing both to those who
conducted it and to the officers and
enlisted men of the North Dakota
Regiment.
May Move Camp
Unless arrangements can be made
for draining a swamp adjacent to the
camp of the First North Dakota In­
fantry at Mercedes, it is contemplat­
ed to remove that organization to
another location. Army officers here
say that it will be impossible to main­
tain the past record for healthfulness,
unless conditions caused by incessant
rains for several months are reme­
died. Fifteen men are reported to
have been removed to the hospital at
the big camp at Llano Crande, three
miles from Mercedes. They had con­
tracted malaria fever owing to the
presence at the camp of mosquitoes,
which breed in the swamp mentioned.
The matter has been taken up by
the Mercedes Commercial Club with
the idea of doing the necessary drain­
age work. The Club is anxious that
the camp be maintained at Mercedes
and it is probable that the necssary
arrangements will be made so that
the present location of the North Da­
kota Infantry will not be condemned.

Fire last night did damage to the
extent of $27,000 on Main street.
Clooten's livery stable, the Star res­
taurant owned by Frank Evarts and
Fred Monier's shooting gallery are
a total loss. Origin of the blaze is
unknown.
Lack of a high wind, efficient work
of the firemen and the excellent man­
ner in which the new high pressure
booster pumps shot the water enabled
the fighters to get what appeared for
some time to be a fire that was a
menace to the block, under control
before it spread to any other build­
ings.
Burned While Freeing Horses.
Pete Nukish was severely burned
on the left arm while cutting loose
the horses. Although the fire was
raging directly above them in the
hay, Nukish and Walter Clooten work­
ed in the smoke-filled barn until ev­
ery one of the 2'i tun-sex had been
given their freedom and clubbed out
of the structure.
Some of ihem ran part way clown
the street and then turned and rush­
ed back to the burning stable. The
men closed the door and prevented
them from going in.
Carriages Burn.
Tty this time the barn was ablase
from one end to the other, and only
five carriages could be gotten out.
One was hauled as far as the doorway
and left, as the men fled.
A bunch of boys watching the fire
saw an opportunity in the Star res­
taurant and raided the pie counter.
Some of them rushed out in the street,
carrying their captured luxuries, but
others were so excited that they com­
menced eating them on the spot, un­
conscious of the fire that was creep­
ing in upon I hem. Bystanders called
to them to conte out, but they didn't
move until the firemen took a second
off from the big blaze and shot water
in on them.

ken in Three Places Still
Alive at Press Time.
James Flannigan of Jamestown was
probably fatally injured at about 11:30
last evening, when he attempted to

PREDICTS BRIGHT
BUSINESS FUTURE
Cloud Upon Domestic Horizon Is
Relation of Capital and La­
bor, Says, PresKjpnt.j,
Long Branch, N". J., Sept. 23.—
President Wilson today actively open­
ed his campaign for re-election with,
a speech replying to Republican crit­
icism of his settlement of the recent­
ly threatened railroad strike. Before
a large crowd assembled at Shadow
Lawn, he defended the eiglit hour day
law, and declared also that the na­
tion must be freed of the possibility
of interference with Its CQnjjpprce.
Business men from various parts of
New Jersey interrupted the President
with handclapping and cheering.
"The chief cloud that is upon the
domestic horizon, is the unsatisfac­
tory relation of capital and labor,"
the President said, adding that, "so
long as labor and capital stands an­
tagonistic the interests of both are
injured, and the prosperity of Amer­
ica is held back from the triumphs
which are legitimately its own."
Bright Business Future.
Mr. Wilson spoke of the bright fu­
ture for American business and then
launched directly into a discussion of
the railroad 'situation. Without di­
rectly mentioning Charles J£. Hughes,
'the republican nominee, the Presi­
dent brought in the Republican party
by saying that about 70 republicans
supported the eight hour law in the
House of Representatives and Senate
Republicans put no Obstacle in the
way of the passage of the measure.
"This was because the proposal was
reasonable and was based on right,"
asserted Mr. Wilson.
No Cause- for ArbiiratiOiV 1
The President met the argument
that the railroad question should have
been arbitrated with the flat state­
ment that he did not believe the eight
hour day an arbitral question.
Means of preventing a repetition of
the threatened railroad strike were
taken up in detail. The President
said:
"It will be intolerable if at any time
any group of men, by any process,
shall be suffered to cut society off
from the necessary supplies which
sustain life."
After talking for twenty minutes
about the railroad problem, the Presi­
dent discussed business generally.
Me said that business in America
have their real commercial strength
put at their service by such meas­
ures as the Federal Reserve Act and
now are on their mettle.
Mr. Wilson spoke from the porch
of Shadow Lawn. He was introduced
by W. P. Kunyon, of Perth Arboy, N.
J., who said men in all parts of the
country were organizing to secure the
President's re-election.

Phoenix, Ariz., Sept. 23.—Drys of
all political parties, led by Governor
Hunt, welcomed the Prohibition Na­
tional Campaigners here tonight, after
a trip from Los Angeles, broken only
by two short stops at Wickenberg and
Glendale, Ariz.
A local state fight primarily was
responsible for the coming of the
campaigners to Arizona. They paid
particular attention to it in their
speeches. Drys here are attempting
to strengthen the present state-wide
prohibition law by amendment, which
would make it a misdemeanor punish­
able by a fine or imprisonment or
both, to have liquor in one's passes
sion.
J. Frank Hanley, the presidential
nominee, declared that the Prohibition
party would cut a big figure in the
present campaign, and there were
only two parties left, Prohibition and
Anti-Prohibition.
COX WILL DIRECT
Grand Forks, Sept. 23.—An impor­
tant announcement made public yes­
terday was that of the appointment
by the state board of regents of Dr.
John W. Cox of the faculty of the col­
lege of medicine of the University
of North Dakota as acting director of
the state public health laboratory.
Dr. Cox will fill the position left
vacant, by Dr. L. D. Bristol, who re­
signed recently to accept a position
in Harvard university. Dr. Bristol's
resignation was accepted by the state
board of regents at their September
meeting which concluded yesterday in
Bismarck. T)r. Cox will enter upon
the duties of bis office at once.
Man Is Shot
as Result of
Labor War
Chicago, Sept. 23.—While hundreds
of persons looked on, James Mooney,
49 years old, secretary of the Chicago
painters' union, was shot in the leg
at a busy down town corner this
evening. The shooting was the result,
police believe, of a labor war which
opened today with the exploding of a
bomb at the residence of R. A.
Shields, financial secretary of the
Electric Workers' union.
Roy Shields, a relative of the man
whose house was damaged by the
•bomb, was held, accused of the shoot­
ing.
KO STATE
Indianapolis, Ind., Sept 23.—Indian­
apolis put on a red and yellow dress
of fire tonight to welcome Charles B.
'Hughes. His special rolled into the
station half an hour ahead of sched­
uled time and the celebration upon
which Republicans "Tierc have spent
days was on.
They met him with a bedlam of
cheers, yells factory whistles and au­
tomobile sirens. They lighted their
fireworks and plastered their flaming
red on the Indiana sky. They stood
by the tens cf thousand in the streets
nd along the wy. Most of the time
they could not see im, but they knew
he wa sthere.
They shot up more rockets and
burned more red fire and made more
smoke and cheered more and more.
The cheers of the crowds acted as a
tonic.
Mr. Hughes' voice was almost gone
when he reached the city. He had
been husbanding it all day and deliv­
ered only meagre addresses to crowds
which turned out to see him all the
way from South Eend. iHis throat
was not helped by the ppeech at
Gary in the open air, with a raw wind
from Lake Michigan. His doctors
said, however, his condition was only
a poor indication of the strain to
which his voial chords had been sub­
jected. There was a possibility, the
physicians said, they might cease
suddenly at any time to do their work
without a period of rest.

San Antonio. Texas, Sept. 23.—An
investigation will be made of the act
of eight members of the Texas cav­
alry who yesterday crossed the Rio
Grande Mexican line near Rio Dosa,
and were fired upon by Mexicans.
Colonel Barnum, chief of staff to Gen­
eral Funston, made this announce­
ment tonight and added if the action
of the guardsmen was not justified
they would be tried and punished.
According to the report the Ameri­
cans were fired upon by ten Mexicans
and one of the troopers lost his
horse. No mention is made as to
whether or not the Americans return­
ed the fire.
GERMANY MAKES
SOAPS AND FOOD
OF CHERRY PITS!
Lerlin, Sept. 23.—Prussian chem­
ists have discovered that cherry
stones or pits contain fats and
oils, and at present every school­
boy and school-girl in Prussia is
collecting them and delivering
them at the nearest government
depots established for that pur­
pose in the cities, towns and vil
iges.
From the cherry stones chem­
ists have extracted enough fat for
the manufacture of a cake of soap.
A hundred stones yield enough oil
for a portion of salad, and from a
thousand stones can be extracted
fat and oil in such quantities as to
supply a whole household.

New York, Sept. 23.—Traction lines
of New York upon which a strike has
been in progress since September
6 were only placed upon the unfair
list today by the conference of labor
leaders, which yesterday called for a
suspension of work of approximately
160,600 workers to aid the striking
carmen. Arrangements have been
made to picket the subway, elevated
and surface lines, it was announced,
for the purpose of "'discovering the
patrons." Penalties for riding upon
these lines will be imposed on mem­
bers of unions by their respective
organizations, it was stated by Ernest
Bohm, secretary of the Central Fed­
erated union.
The proposal to suspend work is
based by labor leaders upon the con*
tention that union men have no right
to ride upon cars operated by strike
breakers and protected by policemen.
They assert, in addition, that by using
such means of transportation they are
menacing their personal safety.
Continue Strike Plans.
Members of the labor conferense,
which is said to represent 80 unions,
in Greater New York continued their
plans today to put the sympathetic
strike in effect at 8 o'clock next Wed­
nesday morning.
One Coot ion of trade unionism Is
xaid to hold to the belief that the
"suspension of work" would constitute
a repudiation and abrogation of satis­
factory contracts, which were signed
in many cases after long and difficult
circumstances.
The state bureau of mediation and
arbitration announced that it would
begin next Tuesday a searching in*
quiry into the strike situation.
POSSE OK THAI
or
Man Who Shot Girl School
leacher Thought to Be in
Swamp.
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 23.—A fresh
trail, thought to have been made by
the unidentified man who attacked
Miss Olga Dahl, Round Lake school
teacher, Wednesday night, was found
leading into one of the most inacces­
sible swamps in this section shortly
after 7:00 p. m. today. The trail was
found by posse men, who were cover­
ing a strip of country on the south
side of Round Lake.
The trail was made by a man, who
is believed to have been running with
a long, swinging stride, and as the
word flashed from group to group of
the searching men, a strong cordon
was thrown about the swamp, and the
capture of the man is expected at
any time.
A detail of the best men, under
the charge of Sheriff Charles Gunder
son, carrying pine knot torches and
lanterns, are slowly following the
trail through the tangle of btyrties and
underbrush. The posse men believe
that the man cannot go far through
the swamp and feel that they may
come upon him at any time.
Although the fugitive will have a
decided advantage, should he decide
to shoot it out with the men who are
trailing him, those who are following
the trail decided to go into the swamp
rather than give the man an oppor­
tunity to escape.
A detail of men has been sent on
the back trail to learn where the
tracks began and how long a start the
person who made them has over the
searchers.

Fargo, Sept. 23.—H. W. Norton,
alias Harry Nolan, who was arrested
by Sheriff J. C. Ross at Arnegard
Monday evening on a charge of wife
desertion, is also a bigamist, officials
claimed yesterday. The Mrs. Nolan
whom he deserted here about two
years ago is reported to be his second

an in Virginia, Minn., in 1910, officials
say.
