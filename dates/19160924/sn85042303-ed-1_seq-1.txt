rious phases of the Mexican affairs

again becoming a military factor.
Major General Scott, chief of staff,

One Hundred More Monkeys.
Manila, Sept. 23. Olio hundred
Philippine monkeys have been ship
ped on the Japanese steamer Nippon
Maru, cons'giicd in the Rockefeller
Institute, New York. The monkeys
were raptured In Lacuna province,
close to Manila, and cost 75 cents
"ach. A Filipino caretaker accom
panies them on their ing voyage.
The monkeys are sent as a result
of an arrangement mad; some time
ago between Dr. Flexner of the Rock
efeller Institute and Dr. Alvln S. Cox
Jirector of sclenre of the Philippine
government. At the outbreak of tho
epidemic of Infantile p?ralysls in New
York, Dr. Flexner cabled a request to
send the monkeys at once. A special
permit was Issued by the American
health authorities to permit the mon
keys to enter the United States, thu
waiving the embargo on Philippine
animals, enforced by the sanitary of
ficials. The Old Guard Still Commands.
That the Republican party Is a
party of Inaction as well as reac
tiontion Is shown by the vote In the
senate on the Emergency Revenue
measure. Every republican senator,
save five, when voting on that bill,
vote against:
1. A non-parfan tariff commission.
2. Readjustment of tariff on dye
stuffs. 3. Protection against post-bellum,
dumping.
4. Tax on excessive profits on war
munitions.
5. Inheritance tax on swollen f r
tunes the most Justifiable of all
taxes.
5. Increase In Income surtaxes a
mall increase lu taxes of the very
rich.
Of such are the leaders of the
forces that nominated Hugh's, and
who will be in power in the event
of Republican success.
