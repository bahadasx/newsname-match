Extension of' District water and
sower mains to the 102 square
miles -of Maryland territory in
Montgomery and Prince George's
counties immediately adjacent to
the District, is planned by the au
thorities of both jurisdictions, it
was learned today.
The project ultimately will mean
the abandonment of the water and
sewer systems of practically all of
the Maryland communities sub
urban to this city, which are in
cluded in the area incorporated by
the last Maryland legislature and
known as the Washington Sub
urban Sanitary District.

atrucUon are being- built sufficiently
large to accommodate the aewace from
the area. In queaUon, which Includes the

project wilt eliminate the pollution of
the streams flowing from the area Into
the District, experts declare.
This pollution li recognized as a
rapidly growing- menace to the health
of the District, and for this reason the
District authorities are taking an ac

Frequent conferences have been held
between the District sewer and water
departments. Robert B. Morse, the en

the crew had no time to make any
fires before she was surrounded by
the British warships.

One of the outstanding features was
the pledge of several men who were

assessment, was received from West

were made, and It Is thought likely by
the officials of the Milk Producers'

Roumanians Retreat at Vulcan
Pass, Gain in Dobrudja and
in Macedonia.
PAIII8, Sept. 24. Conflicting reports
are received regarding the fighting In
Transylvania, the Auatrlans reporting
the recapture of mountain passes .on
their eastern front, whllo the Rouma-
Knlans allege gains on the southern
border. One report has It that the
Roumanlana already hold one-fourth
of Transylvania. The country Is a
very difficult one for the movement of
troops, especially artillery. Full of
high mountains, with narrowjalleya
between, the task of penetrating tt Is
very like that of the Italians on their
northern front.
Referring to fighting In this section,
the Austrian official statement says:
"Vulcan pass has been evacuated by
the enemy. Near Hermannstadt an
attack by two Roumanian divisions
was repulsed. Three officers and 662
men wero made prisoners. South of
Holzmeny the enemy forced our ad
vance guard to fall back somewhat.
. Jn "I? .an.,a f0"nt by the three
states Bukowlna. Hungary, and Rou
manla, south of Dorna Watra, we
drove back Roumanian detachmenta
by counter attacks."
In the Dobrudja once more the Rou
manian and Russian troops are on the
offensive and are driving Madkensen's
army back toward the Bulimrinn hnr.
dcr.
By smashing at the flanks of the
enemy one along the Danube and the
other resting on the Black Sea coast
me ainea troops are rorcing his whole
line back.
Unofficial reports lead observers here
to believe that the retreat of the Bul
gars along the southern bank of the
Danube almost has been turned Into a
rout. Sillstrla has already been aban-
(Contlnued on Second P.tgo.)

Mr. Mehorner, prominent attorney,

had driven their automobile through
DeKalb. An appeal to the mayor and

Mississippi towns carried news of par

Germans Make Futile Attempts
to Push Back Foes' Steadily
Advancing Lines.
LONDON, Sept. 24. Operating
chiefly on the northern front from
Thiepval to Flers, the British un
der General Haig won a half-mile
line east of Courcelotte today,
tightening their grip on the Albert-
Bapaume road.
This brings them nearer Le Sars'
and gives them possession of more
high ground skirting the Bapaume
plateau.
Combles still remains in the
hands of the Teutons and until this
village falls the Germans will hold
a sharp wedge in the enemy's line.
The French are closing in on
Combles from three sides, while the
British are ready to move forward
on a fourth. French patrols have
reached the borders of the village
on both the south and the east,
while on the west they can push
forward easily from Leusee wood '
and Falfemont farm.
COUNTER '.BLOWS FAIL.
The Germans made several futile at
tempts today to drive back the allied
lines in counter attacks.
On both banks of the Somme the air
men have been engaged In almost Inces
sant combat. The allied planes are fly
ing hourly over the German line, gaug
ing the strength of the enemy'a posi
tions and destroying ammunition depots
and fortified posts.
"South of the Ancre we continued to
Improve our positions. During a bom
bardment by our artillery of one section
of tho enemy's front ten hostile gun pits
were seen to be destroyed, fourteen
others severely damaged and five am
munition pits blown up.
"A big fire was caused by our artil
lery In a village much' used by the
enemy's transport for supply purposes.
According to the Berlin official state
