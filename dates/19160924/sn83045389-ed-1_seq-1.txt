There llave I.ecu times," he said,
when it looked as it" America were in
terested only hi herself, lint In these,
recent years American business men
have lilted their eyes 10 more distant
horizons, and have seen how the
markets oi the worbl were waiting i
for their s-rvice, and. as they havrj /
sought ami obtained entrance liito[
these markets, a new vision has uouwtj
to them 01 w hat the development of '
the resources 01' Amerlcit means; of
I what the organization of American i
ellieicitcy means: of why it was that .
American inerchants and American 'j;
manufacturers and American inlncra i'
ami all the multitude of men who have
I developed tin- peaceful industries of
| America were planted under tills free
j policy, in order that they might look
?out upon tin- service of mankind ami
