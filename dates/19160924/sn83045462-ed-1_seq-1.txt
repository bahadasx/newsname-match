LONDON*. September 24, 3:39 a.m.?
?One German airship and probably an
other was brought down during a raid
over the eastern counties of England
and the outskirts of London last night,
according to an official statement. One
airship was brought down in the south
ern part of Essex and it is reported an
other fell on the Essex coast. No re
ports of casualties or damage have
been received. The text of the state
t ment follows:
"An attack by hostile airships was
made on Lincolnshire and the eastern
counties and on the outskirts of Lon
don. The latter attack was made from
the northeast and the southeast about
midnight, and was beaten off by our
anti-aircraft defenses.
"One airship was brought down in
flames in the southern part of Essex,
and a report has been received that
another fell on the Essex coast. Thf j
latter report hitherto is unconfirmed.
"No reports of casualties or damage
have yet been received."
Pyrotechnic Display.
The raiders apparently did not come
so near to London as on the occasion
of the destruction of the L-21 on Sep
tember 2. The sound of gunfire was
fainter when the distant reports of
anti-surcraft weapons shortly after
midnight heralded the approach of the
raiders. The observers on the roofs
and bridges of the city, however, were
treated to quite a pyrotechnic display
of shrapnel bursting around a Zep
pelin visible in the sky seeminjgly
somewhere in the remote outskirts of
London.
This spectacle was of short duration,
as the Zeppelin made ofT, finding the
^ reception too hot, and the sound of
cannonading soon died.
Object Bants Into Glow.
Flashes in the sky indicated that the
conflict had not finished, and it wap an
hour lifTii shsrflT after 1 o'elecltin

ttwnw an * eJty brM?? at* a Kttfi
cigarlike object suddenly burst into .a

was no vivid lighting up the sky as oh
September 2, but the crowd of onlook
ers still taking a sporting interest in
the visitation, despite the lateness of
the hour, took it for granted that an
other Zeppelin had met its doom and
enthusiastically cheered the prowess
of thex defenders.
Some waited t? see if other raiders
would fall victims, but there was no
further disturbance of the now - peace
ful star-lit sky, and Londoners quietly
returned to their beds, confident that
they would awake in the morning to
find official confirmation that the por
tent they had witnessed in the heavens
was the destruction of a Zeppelin.
One Shot Down in Last Raid.
In the last raid by German airships
over England, three weeks ago. a Zep
pelin was brought down in the London
district. The crew of the Zeppelin was '
killed and later buried near tke spot i
where the airship descended in flames.
Lieut. William L. Robinson of th?i Royal
Flying Corps was responsible for the
destruction of the raider and was
awarded the Victoria Cross for his ex
ploit.
A British official statement said that
thirteen airships participated in the
raid over the eastern counties and the
London districts- on the night of Sep
tember 2-3. Outside of London two
persons were killed and eleven injured.
There was some property damage, but
no military damage, it was announced
officially in London.
Berlin announced the loss of the air
ship and claimed that the raid had re
sulted in the bombardmeht of the "fort
ress of London" and Yarmouth and
Harwich, as well as factories in the
southeastern counties. The statement
added that good effects were observed.

LONG BRANCH. N. J.. September 23?
President Wilson today actively opened
his campaign for re-election with a
speech replying to republican criticism
of his settlement of the recently'threat
ened railroad strike.'
With emphatic gestures, before a
large crowd assembled at Shadow
Lawn, he defended the eight-hour day
and declared, also, that the nation must
be freed from the possibility of inter
ference with its commerce. Business
men from variona part* of New Jersey
often interrupted the President with
handclapping and cheering.
"The'chief cloud that is upon the do

President said, adding that, "80 long as

To Prevent Uepetition.

the threatened railroad strike were
taken up in detail. The President said:
"It will be intolerable if at any time
any group of men by any process
should be Buffered to cut society off
from the necessary supplies which sus

After talking for twenty minutes
about the railroad problem, the Presi

Said that business men In America
have had their real commercial

and now are on their mettle.
Mr. Wilson spoke from the porch or

INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. September 23.
?Indianapolis put on red and yellow
dress of fire tonight to welcome
Charles E. Hughes. His special rolled
into the station half an hour ahead of
scheduled time, and the celebra
tion, upon which hepublicans here have
spent , days of preparation, was on.
Tfyey met him wi\h a bedlam . of
cheers, yells, factory whistles and
automobile sirens- They lighted their
fireworks and plastered a patch of
flaming red on the Indiana sky. They
stood by the tens of thousands in the
streets and cheered him along the way.

1 was there, with Charles W. Fairbanks,
his running mate, in one of the flrst
| automobiles, and they shot up more
rockets and burned more red fire and
made more smoke and cheered ^some
more.
Line Extends Two Miles.
Scores of fiag-bedecked automobiles
swung into line behind the nominee's
car for the parade through the city to
Tomlinson Hall. Behind the cars
eame the men on foot, thousands of
torch-bearing marchers. Republican
leaders. who staged the big demonstra
tion said that the line of marchers ex
tended for more than two miles. Dong
after the nominee had started to speak
the marchers were still weaving their
way through the red glare, of the city.
The streets around the station and
along the line of march were choked
by throngs the like of which the nomi
nee has not met anywhere since the day
he started on his presidential cam
paign. Bluecoats by the hundred kept
the way clear.
Mr. Hughes' voice was almost gone
when he reached the city. He had been
husbanding it all day, delivering
meager little addresses to the crowds
which turned out to see him at stations
along the way from South Bend. His
throat was not helped by the speech at
Gary, in the open air. with a raw wind
from Lake Michigan. He was hoarse
tonight, but the hoarseness, his doctor
a*id, was only a poor indication of the

From Time He teft Train.
The red flfre. the cheers of the crowds,
the marching thousands, however, act

from the time he left the train. He
spent most of the time during the
parade standing up In his car, waving
his hat in acknowledgment.
The speech which Mr. Hughes de
livered here tonight wound up his In
diana campaign, so far as this trip is
concerned. Mr. Hughes will remain
here as the guest of Mr. Fairbanks till
early Monday, when he will leave for
Dayton. Ohio.
When Introducing Mr. Hughes,
Charles W. Fairbanks, the chairman of
the meeting, said of him:
"We recognize in him a man who is
in sympathy with our highest ideals?
the advocate of every good cause; the
sincere and helpful friend of the great
body of wage earners in America. He
stands for policies which meftn befter
wages for more people and for more of
the time than do the policies of the
democratic party.
"Abie, straightforward, unafraid in
every responsibility; able as governor
of the great Empire state; the enemy
of graft and grafters everywhere. I
present to you a man who is a pro
found student of the problefns of our
government, who will act in every ex
igency when he has mastered the
truth."
Audience Waits Patiently.
It was 8:40 o'clock?more than an
hour after he arrived?before Mr.
Hughes addressed the crowd. The big
audience had waited patiently from 7
o'clock. Many had stood the entire
time. Thousands were turned away,
unable to get into the hall.
"This great demonstration seems to
me." Mr. Hughes said, "a sincere, cor
dial and enthusiastic manifestation of
I an intense desire for the success of the
republican ticket in November. 1 con
sider it a happy augury of success in
i state and nation."
The din of blaring bands, horns, cow
; bells and the shouts of the marchers
outside drifted into the hall, a discord
ant medley. Now and then the roar of
exploding rockets blotted out the nom
inee's voice. The noise from the street
was so great it hampered seriously the
candidate's speaking.
Charges Broken Pledges.
Mr. Hughes again. reviewed repub
lican legislation of tne past, assailed
the administration for what he termed
: broken pledges and extravagant
claims, and outlined republican poli
j cles of the campaign. He dwelt at
length upon the doctrine of protective
I tariff.
| "The only thing," he said, "that
| stands more than anything else as a
menace to the prosperity of this coun
try is a continuance of a democratic
idministration in power."
Mr. Hughes read the following ex
cerpt from President Wilson's speech
of acceptance:
" 'We have professed to believe that
every people has the right to order its
own institutions as it will, and we must
live up to that profession In our ac
tions in absolute good faith/
"I deeply deplore," Mr. Hughes added,
"that that principle, so eloquently
stated and. so important in our rela
tions with other nations in this herai~
sphere, was not regarded In our deal
ings with Mexico."
Answer* Query About 1607.
"How about 1?07?" asked a man in
the balcony, when Mr. Hughes assailed
the democratic party for the business
depression of 1MI.
"How about H077" the nominee
quickly repeated, pointing his finger at
the questioner. "We had a monetary
condition In 1?#7 which the republican
party the very next year rectified by the
Aidrlch-Vreeland bill, which saved this
country from panic in Mil." The crowd
yelled.
Mr. Hughes read again what he said
was a statement that President Wilson
"before April, H1C authorised John
Lind to make "to a minister from.an
Important power," saying that "Huerta
must get out, by domestic means if pos*
stble, by other means if necessary."

Sentiment Conceded tor the
Democrats, While Republi
cans Claim the Votes.
BT N. O. MESSENGEB.
CHICAGO. 111., September 23.?I won't
bore you with a long dissertation on
politics in the west, because there is a
lot more of it to come before election
day, but if you should ask me to say
bflefly how the situation here impresses
an unbiased observer the answer would
be this: "That the democrats have
plenty of sentiment on their side, ar
gument and all that, while the repub
licans seem to have the most votes in !
prospect." |
Put it another way: Democratic man
agers will tell you in talking confiden
tially that they cannot for the life of
them see how President Wilson can be
defeated, on the face of things in gen
eral, yet when they try with pencil and
paper they cannot figure how he is to
get the votes in the electoral college to
elect him. But for all that the demo
crats are making the fight and making
it gamely. This seems to be their turn
to forge to the front, and for the next
two weeks it is predicted you will see
the democrats bracing up all through
the west.
Bepublicans Fear a* "Surprise."
Confidentially, what some of the re
publicans are worrying about is the
fear that President Wilson is holding
back a surprise to spring on them in
the last days of the campaign. They
don't know what it may be, but just
kind o' detect it in the air.
But some of them say that if it is
anything akin to the eight-hour coup,
why, let him come along with it, and
welcome.
Coming into a region after absence
of a fortnight or so, one senses the in
tangible change in the political atmos
phere. One time the republicans will
be making all the laps, while the demo
crats appear to be pausing for breatlf
and a rutf-down. Then the democrats,
with a whoop and hurrah, take the
track and there Is nothing to be seen
but the democratic dust as they liven
up the race.
It is still seven weeks until the elec
tion, so we may witness several such
performances Alternating. For the
past two weeks the republicans have
been having it all their own way. First,
there was the Maine election, with the
new issue exploited by Candidate
Hughes; then the New York primaries,
then the candidate's second drive into
the west and the renewed enthusiasm,
until It would seem that the woods
were full of republicans and all the
democrats had gone home In despair, i
Pendulum Takes Another Swing.
Now watch the pendulum swing the
other way for a while. The democrats
have been working quietly, have had
their men in the field, have been slav
ing night and day on organization?
routine, but highly essential. They
had the first start at the organization
and were ahead of the republicans un
til the latter got up steam and caught
up with them.
From now on?for another two weeks, j
possibly?it is expected the democratic
campaign will take on added Impetus,
which will be started by President Wil
son's speech. They are waiting for it
out west because the republicans have
had all the spotlight In campaign ora
tory and publicity.
As soon as that is delivered hundreds
of democratic spellbinders are ready to
take up the tidings and spread them
abroad for the delectation of the faith
ful.

FLORIDA'S GUNS LEAD
Record of Ninety Per Cent Hits Un
likely to Be Surpassed By
Others in Fleet.
NORFOLK, Va.v September 23.?Mak
ing the remarkable record of 90 per
cent hits, in individual target practice,
short and at intermediate ranges, with
her big- guns, the U. S. S. Florida led
the Atlantic fleet in gunnery efficiency
at the close of this week. The Texas
rapks second and the Wyoming third.
The Oklahoma. Pennsylvania and Ne
vada are yet to complete ?individual
target work, and it is up to one of
these to overtake the Florida for the
coveted first honor. The belief of of
ficers is that the competition of the
target practice off the capes will see
the Florida stilt leading. It being de
clared that the record made will be
hard to beat.
Postpone Long Bange Work.
The Florida's official record, using
her 12-inch guns, for the entire pre
scribed program of the individual tar
get work, was 54 hits out of 58 shots
fired. The practice was only at short
and intermediate ranges. The possible
dangers to navigation at this time of
the year will preclude a sea range of
over 10,000 yards, and the long range
practice has been postponed until the
fleet goes to Guantanamo this winter,
it is announced.
Practically the entire fleet is in
Hampton roads tonigTit, for week-end
shore leaves to the men, but will re
turn to sea early Monday morning.
The target practices and maneuvers
will be completed by the end of the
week, when the ships of the fleet will
break division formations and proceed
to their home yards.

UNFAIR LIST AIMED
AT N. Y. CAR LINES
Traction Strikers WW Picket
City Routes and Punish
Union Men Who Ride.
NEW YOFiK, September 23.?Traction
lines of New York, upon which a strike
has beep in progress since September
6, were officially placed upon the unfair
list today by the conference of labor
leaders which yesterday called for a
suspension of work by approximately
600,000 workers to aid the striking car
men.
Arrangements have been made to
picket the subway, elevated and surface
lines, it was announced, for the pur
pose of "discovering the patrons." Pen
! alties for riding upon these lines will
j be imposed on members of unions by
their respective organizations, it was
j stated by Ernest Bohm, secretary of
the Central Federated Union.
The proposal to suspend work is
based by labor leaders upo^ the con
tention that union men have no right
to ride upon cars operated by strike
breakers and protected by policemen.
They assert, in addition, that by using
such means of transportation they are
menacing their personal safety.
?
Predicts Great Tie-Up.
Members of the labor conference,
which is said to represent eighty
unions in Greater New York, continued
their plans today to put the sympa
thetic strike into effect at 8 o'clock
Wednesday morning. Several of the
leaders issued statements in which they
said individual unions were signifying
their indorsement of the conference ac
tion and predicting a widespread tie-up
of the city's industries.
One faction of trades unionism, how
ever, is said to hold the belief that the
proposed "suspension of work" would
constitute repudiation and abrogation
of satisfactory contracts which were
signed, in many cases, after long and
difficult negotiations. Those favoring
a sympathetic strike have taken the
position, on the contrary, that there
would be no violation of contract obli
gations provided the workers expressed
their willingness to continue at work
if their employers were able to supply
them with satisfactory means of trans
portation.
s?'
Impossible in Some Trades.
Under existing contracts a strike
would be impossible in the building
trades-of the city, in the allied print
ing trades and several others, it was
said.
The state bureau of mediation and
arbitration announced that itj^would
begin next Tuesday a searching in-'
quiry into the traction strike.
An injunction was issued by the su
preme court here today restraining
local officers of the Amalgamated Gar
ment Cutters' Association from calling
out on strike members of the union
who have individual contracts with
employers. The court also forbade acts
of violence, threats or intimidation.
It was said tonight that this action
may have wide application in connec
tion with the threatened general strike
of trade unionists next Wednesday.

Head of Police Committee of
Northeast Citizens Thinks
Commissioners Can Act.
I "LET THE OTHER FELLOW
FIGHT THE LAW," HE SAYS.
I Dr. L. A. Walter Declares Resolution
Will Be Offered at First Meet
ing of Association for Action.
"The number of homicides and sui
cides committed in this city during re
cent v years," said Dr. L. A. Walter,
chairman of the committee on police
of the Northeast Washington Citizens'
Association, to a reporter for The Star
last night, "suggests the advisability
of adopting a drastic law to throw ad
ditional safeguards about the sale and
carrying of implements of death.
"If something is not done in the near
future," he added, "it will not be the
fault of the association. The associa
tion already is on record as favoring a
remedial law, and at the first fall meet
ing the committee on police will pre
sent a resolution dealing with the ques
tion."
Discussing the question of enacting
a regulation that will make the pur
chase of weapons more difficult. Dr.
Walter said he thought it the duty of
the Commissioners to take such action.
It has been hinted that the Commis
sioners are without authority to adopt
such a regulation, he sa?d, because the
present law is an act of Congress.
"But why should that make any dif
ference?" he asked. "It would not be
the first law that the courts had up
set and it might be the means of sav
ing human life. If a man bent on
murder or suicide and thinking only of
using a pistol to commit the deed were
to find it necessary to wait ten or fif
teen days in order to get a weapon, he
might change his mind and abandon
the idea of participating in the enact
ment of a tragedy.
"Under these circumstances," *he said,
"is it not worth making the effort? En
act the law and let the other fellow
make the fight."
The fact that six persons were slain
with the ever-ready pistol last week,
it is stated, has not affected the display
of revolvers of all kinds in store win
dows. Maj. Pullman, superintendent of
police, says he thinks such displays are
suggestive and bad and should be
stopped, but under the law in force in
this city at this time, he states, the po
lice department is powerless to put a
stop to the practice.
Dozens of weapons were displayed
in store windows about the city last
night. In some instances tags were
attached to the weapons to indicate
that reduced prices prevailed, iriteh,
the pottee *afv4s asu-*sudtaXie* to ?oon
irresponsible person to enter and make
a purchase.
Maj. Slyvester'a Report.
When Maj. Sylvester vras chief of po
lice he made numerous reports urging
the necessity for a change in the con
cealed weapon law, and Maj. Pullman
intends to continue the fight until
something is accomplished.
William F. Peabody, who has taken
such a deep interest in safety-first
methods, has declared himself emphati
cally in favor of regulations to prevent
the promiscuous sale of weapons in the
District. He was deeply interested in
the publicity campaign waged by The
Star last year, and at that time he pre
sented figures to show the disastrous
results of the use of pistols. He said:
"We point with horror to the great
losses of life in the European war. yet
in the registration area of the United
States in 1911 6,533 persons came to their
death through firearms. Of these 2,859
were suicides. 2,347 were homicides and
1,327 cases were the results of accident
or were undefined.
"Shooting proved by far the most wide
ly used method of murder. The total
number of homicides was 3,907, and of
this portion 2,347 cases were by firearms.
Next in popularity were instruments of a
cutting or piercing nature, and these to
taled but 638. All other means employed,
added together, were but 922.
"In suicides firearms proved the most
popular of methods, with but one excep
tion. This was poison. Yet the total of
those who died by poison of all the vari
ous sorts and kinds was but 2,927, as
against the 2,859 scored by firearms. The
next two methods dropped more than a
thousand below these two marks.
Cases of Accidental Death.
| "In accidental deaths resulting from
' firearms, of the total of 1,327 persons
. killed the highest number of any group
fell between ten and nineteen years of
i age?494. The group Just above this (be
tween twenty and twenty-nine years)
had the next highest number of deaths?
279. Other groups showing the next high
est totals were as follows: Between five
and nine years, 101; forty and forty-nine
years, 107; between thirty and thirty-nine.
165 deaths. The point I would make is |
that the greater number of accidental >
deaths from fifirearms occurred in the '
cases of youthful and quite probably reck
less persons.
"In view of all this it certainly seems
that some rigid action should be taken
to prevent firearms from falling into the
hands of irresponsible persons. Un
doubtedly the District should have some
method of curbing their sale."
Commissioner Brownlow's idea of
enforcing absolute prohibition of the
sale of weapons in the District, it is
stated, meets the views of many per
sons connected with civic associations
in the District. It is more than prob
able that the Commissioners will ac
tively work to secure the passage of
a new law at the next session of Con
gress, a law that probably will pro
vide for absolute prohibition of sales
of all weapons that may be concealed
in one's clothing.
A bill such as was introduced by
Representative Sims of Tennessee,
which is similar to the Te^Pas measure,
may be favortd by the Commissioners,
or they may decide upon a measure
requiring police investigation of appli
cants for the purchase of weapons.
Records of Minors Arrested.
Police records bring to light the fact
that the Grinder boy, who the past
week shot and killed Miss Elsie Sacrey,
was not the only minor who traveled
about the city armed during the past
few years. In 1903 three boys under
the age of sixteen years and fifty-four
under twenty-one years of age were
arrested for carrying concealed wea
pons. In 1895 six boys under the age
of sixteen years were listed for viola
tions of the concealer weapons law. the
total arrests for the year aggregating
227.
During the fiscal year 1914 twelve
arrests of boys under seventeen years
old were made for violations of the
concealed weapons law. the total ar
rests for the year aggregating 200.
Nine boys under seventeen years of
age were arrested in 1913. the total
number being 200, the same as in the
succeeding year. In 1893 the total
number of arrests for concealed
weapons was 243, possibly two .dosen
greater than the average. number. <
