knew he was there .villi Charles V.
of the first automobiles and they rhot

Mr. Hughes' voice was almost Kone

been husbanding it all day. delivering
meager little addresses to the crowds
which turned out to see him at sta

Thi re was a possibility, his doctor
said, that his vocal cords might cease

without a period of rest.
The red fire, the cheers of tho
crowds, the marching thousands, how
ever, acted as a tonic. Mr. Iluthes

Mr. Burton Is one of the ablest statesmen our nation has ever produced.
Kor 25 years a quarter of a century he has been a member of congress,
either in the house of representatives or In the L'nlted Htates senate, from
the state of Ohio, and during such time he hus been universally recognized
by all parties as one of America's great leaders. He Is one of the most ac
complished and thorough scholars of the day, a lawyer of great ability, a
statesman unexcelled and an orator second to none. Everyone shoula hear
this scholarly statesman In his address on next Monday. There Is no doubt,
If Mr. Hughes is elected prenident, but what Mr. Burton will he offered a
position In the cabinet, either secretary of state or sucretary of the treasury.

construction of t one-hair of ihn

I'so (ovcrnnicnc Money.
Preliminary arrangements have
been made to Use some of the gov

this road and for this purpose ib.ver
nor Williams will be asked to Tulsa
in the near future to go over tho
matter In detail, and ho has already
given his approval to the load in gen

specifications lor roads must l,o ap
proved by the experts 111 the depart

way department. This insures a good
quality of road. In addition, the con
struction work will be passed noon bv
exp( its of the government, winch will
eliminate graft and poor workman

siring on the roads by a clause in Ihe
law which pro . ides that unless roads
constructed with h,f aid of Hie uov-
einiiient are kept repaired by the
county or slate that no more 'assist

This kind of a road is more serviceable
than concrete and cheap r ili.in ordi

per mile.
This roadway gives a little to heavy

The county commissioners of the
two counties can only build the roads
outside of the city limits. This means
Hint a strip about half a mile long
