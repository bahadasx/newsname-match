Washington, Sent. S3. The New

Wednesday will stay out all winter, It
that Is found necessary to win their
fight tor right to organise, according
to Samuel Qompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor.
Gompers was In Washington after
several days' conference In New York.
Gompers declared today that or
ganised labor throughout the nation
has recognized In the New York sltu
stlou one of the most vital turning
points In the history of unionism., He
said organized labor has therefore
accepted J ho challenge and will back
the New York workers to the. last
limits of Its moral, physical and fin
ancial power, '
"The Now York street car fight Is a
fight for union recognition and the
right of workers to organize," said
Gompers today. "I am with these
men, body and soul. Every union man
In the United States la with thorn. We
will all stand behind them In their
fight for personal freedom in anything
thoy do Inside the law.
"It Is the same old principle. Capi
tal Is highly organized. Labor wants
to organize, but capital will not let
tho men do It. This Is a great oppor
tunity to prove that labor has equal
rights with capital and is powerful
enough to assert them."

nection with the same crime, are yet

The clemency of the court was rec
ommended, which means life im
prisonment. s
The verdict was a great surprise to
the court attaches, who figured on

pathized with BUlings crowded
around Mm, shaking his hands and
patting him on the back.
.Attorney McNutt, chief defense
counsel, says Billings Is the victim
of a frame-up. ,
As yet Judge Dunne has not an
nounced the time he will Impose Bil

lieved that he will follow the recom
mendation of the Jurors and impose
life Imprisonment, owing to the cir

Industry May Be Stalled
New York, Sept. 21. New York
awaited with apprehension today
the next turn In the labor war which
threatens on next Wednesday, when
the order for general "suspension of
work." becomes effective to make the
largest city of the world a city of
dead Industries.
Developments of the last 24 hours
have injected much bitterness Into
the labor situation, developing the
strike of surface, subway and elevated
car men. The general strike order,
as Interpreted by union leaders today,
la merely notice to the employers that
union men will not ride to work on
cars ran by strikebreakers and guard
ed by the police; ut. they assert. Its
effect will be a complete tie-up of. in
dustry In the. greater city, through
refusal to work of nearly 800,000
union members.

PEACE PLANS ARE
UPSET BY VILLA
New London, Conn., Sept. 23. Car
ranza's apparent failure to direct an
effective pursuit of the Villista forces
that attacked Chihuahua City may
radically affect the tentative plans ot
the Mexican-American peace confer
ence tor a border patrol. The com
missioners had practically completed
their work on a plan for border pa
trol when the Vllllstas struck. It
called for co-operation by Mexican
troops with General Pershing's forces
in patrolling the border and was
about ready for submission o Wash
ington and Mexico City.
The Villa raid Itself did not alter
the plans ot the conference, stnee the
Vllllstas were beaten off with heavy
losses, according to Carranzlsta re
ports. But the American commission
ers did not believe that General Tre
vlno, the Carranza commander at
Chihuahua City, would start Immedi
ately In vigorous pursuit of Villa
forces and disperse tho bandits.
There has been no Indication that
this has been done. Treylno's failure
to take the aggressive against the
bandits has again raised tho question
ns to whether Csrranza la ablo to or
nnl an effe' tlve patrol to Ruppress
banditry, despite his promises.
Th" whole matter will be threshed
out when General Bliss returns from
WBBh'nRton next week.

away. When that conspiracy was dis
covered. Love was searched and a
