THOMAS-CULROSS
MINING COMPANY
In the Port Wells District, Culross Island,
Alaska-Owned Here-Expect to
Be On Paying Basis Soon
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the company was held in the
office of J. W. Elliott last Tuesday af
ternoon. After the reading and adop
tion of the minutes of the last annual
meeting Don M. Thomas, president o(
the company, made a report and stated
that since the last annual meeting the
company had contracted for the erec
tion of a mill, crushing machinery,
plates and a two hundred horse power
Pelton water power wheel. He stated
that the company had a twelve inch
pipe conveying water to the wheel,
with a two hundred foot fall, which was
ample to furnish power to run the ma-
chinery and a small dynamo to supply
electricity for lighting purposes. Up
. wards of forty thousand feet of lumber
had been shipped to the mine and J.
B. Howard is now superintending the
erection of the mill and other build
ings. An ore crusher of the latest im-
proved kind, with a capacity of fifty
tons every twenty-four hours and other
devices for saving the gold, copper and
other metals, all is now on the dock at
Seattle and will leave next Sunday by
steamer for Culross Hand. He stated
that if no unforseen difficulty inter
vened the property should be on a
paying basis within three months.
M. G. Thomas located the property
in 1910 and sunk a shaft 28 feet deep
on the ore. A number of shipments
of ton lots of ore taken from the shaft
during 1912-13-14 to the Tacoma
smelter showed values from $37 to $82
per ton.
In 1914-15 a low level tunnel was
driven 143 feet and the ore body en
counteree and cross-cut. A drift 260
feet along the vein was also run. The
ore vein runs from 20 to 45 inches in
width. Assay values of ore from the
tunnel run from $25 to $140 to the
ton. The mouth of the tunnel is 200
feet above and about 1200 feet from
the water at Thomas bay, a sheltered
deep water harbor. Tram cars of one
ton capacity will convey the ore from
the tunnel entrance to the mill located
on tidewater. The Thomas Culross
Mining Co. is capitalized at a half mil
lion dollars. The present officers are
D. M. Thomas, president; M. G.
Thomas, vice president. At the meet
ing last Tuesday the following direc
tors were elected: D. M. Thomas, M.
G. Thomas, N. L. Thomas and G. A.
Hamilton, of Leavenworth, and L. L.
Bassett, of Washtucna, Wash. Ac
cording to the bylaws the directors are
empowered and appointed the follow
ing officers: M. G. Thomas, pres.;
A. M. Sampson, vice pres.; N. L.
Thomas, 2nd vice pres.; Guy A. Ham
ilton, secy; D. M. Thomas, treas. and
general manager.
Don M. Thomas left for Seattle on
the afternoon train Tuesday and ex
pects to superintend the loading of the
last of the machinery and supplies for
shipment next Sunday.

Can't Sell Raw Meat on Sunday
Under an obsolete law, not recently
enforced, a Seattle meat seller ran afoul
of the law on complaint of the prose
cuting attorney and Bad to pay a fine.
Cooked meat may be sold because the
law regards it a necessity.
Another feature of the Washington
Sunday law is that tobacco, milk, news
papers and a few other "necessities"
may be exchanged, but such articles
must be sold "in an orderly manner."
"Cutting hair or shaving in a barber
shop, says the statute, "shall not be
considered a necessity."
One is not permitted on Sunday to
sell uncooked meats, groceries, cloth
ing, boots or shoes.
THE PLOT THICKENS
DOWN IN OLD MEXICO
Growing Probability That the U. S. Will
Not Get Out of There Under
a Year or Two
Disquieting and portentiour rumors
come out of the trouble zone in Mex
ico according to the dispatches in the
daily press yesterday. Two thousand
of the best drilled soldiers in the Car
ranza army revolted and joined the
forces of Pancho the Villain. Other
deflections from the Carranza forces are
looked for. More troops are called for
by Gen. Funston and the entire United
States army is to be transferred to the
Mexican border. On Tuesday a reso
lution was introduced in the senate to
call for 50,000 volunteers.
Even if the Carranza troops remain
loyal it is now generally admitted that
catching Villa is no Sunday job and is
likely to take months and perhaps
years. He knows his country while
the United States must rely on un
trustworthy sources of information.
If anything was needed to convince
the people of this country that a larger
army and some preparation for war by
the United States is necessary, the
Mexican squabble will supply the de
ficiency.
Death of Mrs. Bosenberg
Amelia Henrietta Bosenberg was
born in Cologne, Germany, July 19th,
1942. Came to this country New
Year night, 1859. Was married to
Henry George Bosenberg in New Or
leans, Louisiana, in 1860. There were
born to them nine children —five boys
and four girls. They moved to Evans
ville, Indiana, just after the civil war.
Here her husband died June Sth, 1885.
She moved to Chicago, Oct. 16th,
1897, with her daughter, Mrs. Lindsay,
and the latter's husband, with whom
she has since made her home. They
came to Montana, Nov. Ist, 1901.
Came to Washington Sept. 15, 1902,
and lived in Everett for two months,
then came to Leavenworth Dec. 2d,
1902. When Mr. Lindsay died Dec.
21st, 1907, Mrs. Bosenberg seemed to
lose interest in life and hts mourned
him all these years, gradually failing in
health ever since. About eight weeks
ago she began to fail more rapidly and
died at her home in Leavenworth last
Friday, March 17th, at 11:15 a. m.,
aged 73 years, 7 months and 21 days.
All of her children except Mrs. Lind
say have passed away.
The new quarters for the postoffice
it is now believed will Be ready for oc
cupancy about April first. The new
arrangement will give more room for
the working force and the general ar
rangement is an improvement over the
old. The lobby is an improvement in
that it is better finished and looks more
neat and business like-.
Roy Lang underwent an operation in
a Wenatchee hospital this week and a
piece of his skull removed. He was
hit over the head at Blewett the 20th
of November last with a peavey by
Burt Hodge, who is now serving a two
year term at Walla Walla for assault on
Lang. It is believed that Lang, who
has been irrational at intervals, will
now improve.

Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, March 24, 1916
ELEVEN-MILLION DOLLAR
U. S. ARMOR PLANT
Bill Passed U. S. Senate Monday—Nine
Republicans Vote With the
Democrats
The bill to appropriate eleven mil
lion dollars for the building of a gov
ernment armor-making plant passed
the senate Monday by a vote of 58 to
23. The following nine republican
senators voted with the democrats for
the bill: Cummings and Kenyon of
lowa, Borah of Idaho, Poindexter of
Washineton, Works of California, Nor
ris of Nebraska, Sterling of South Daka
tah, Gronna of North Dakotah, and
Clapp of Minnesota. The Bethlehem
and Midvale steel companies, both of
which at present supply tne govern
ment with armor plate threatened to
immediately dismantle their plants so
that the present needs of the govern
ment could not be supplied. Senators
from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts
opposed the bill as confiscatory of pri
vate interests. The bill is expected to
come before the house of representa
sives at once and the prediction is
made that it will pass.
Choose Whom Ye Will
In a late issue of the Wenatchee
world the announcement is made that
Mr. Geo. R. Fisher will be a candi
date for county treasurer. No man in
the county is better fitted for the place.
He has a wide acquaintance in Chelan
county and enjoys the confidence and
esteem of all who have ever had occa
sion to do business with him.
Fred Berry has announced his desire
to again be county engineer. He has
had four years of rest from officril du
ties, most of which has been put in on
private work. Mr. Berry was during
his term of office a painstaking county
official.
There will be no shortage in the
number of capable men for the differ
ent offices in the county is evident.
The names of a dozen or more have
been mentioned for places on the
county ticket.
Preparedness Conference in
Spokane
More than thirty cities have indi
cated their intention to have represent
atives at the great Spokane conference
March 28 and 29. The entire north
west is taking part. Prompters of the
conference say "division of the pork"
is not the object of the meeting, but
it is to be truly a patriotic defense con
ference. Some of the speakers are
army men. Senator Poindexter and
Congressman Dill are down on the pro
gram.
Wants a Divorce
Mrs. Jessie Smith of this place last
week filed suit for divorce in the supe
rior court in Wenatchee against her
husband, Charles Smith, and asks for
825 per month alimony.
The complaint states that they were
married in Portland, July 19, 1910. and
that she was deserted on March IS,
1915. During the five years of her
married life she alleges that he treated
her cruelly and at times threatened to
shoot her.

On the first day of April dog li
censes must be renewed. The city
authorities will collect a license on
every dog kept within the city limits.
Dogs not carrying a license tag will be
impounded and if not redeemed within

Railroad Contractors Here Mon
day
Some seven or,eight contractors who
I will figure on the improvements to be
made between here and Tye the com
ing summer, amounting in the aggre
gate to over a million dollars, snow
sheds coming in for the larger part, •
made the trip from here to the summit
on foot in order to get a better idea of
the ground and the difficulties to be 1
encountered in the work. Several of j
them were heartily disgusted with the
weather. It rained, blowed, and
snowed in a way to make life thoroly
uncomfortable.
A FOUR STATrTfRUir
GROWtRS* ORGANIZATION
Attempt will be Made to Organize Wash
ington, Oregon, Idaho and Mon
tana in One League
Representatives of the fruit selling
agencies, growers' organizations and
fruit growers of four states met at the
Davenport hotel in Spokane, on Thurs
day of this week, at the instance of
the government regresentatives of the
agricultural bureau, who recently spent
a week in conference with the fruit
gTowers and selling agencies of Chelan,
Douglas, Okanogan and Grant coun
ties. The object of the meeting of
those interested in -the fruit in
dustry of the four states is to
combine the interests of these states
under one organization and effect a
considerable economy in the manage
ment by doing away with the duplica
tion of work, and cutting out a num
ber of salary drawing local agents and
managers, making uniform rules for
the packing, shipping and marketing
of fruits of all kinds. It is believed
that if the grower can be freed from
the consignment method, largely due
to his having in the past been under
financial obligations to eastern houses
for advances on his crop, a great step
forward will have been made. The
growers' league, organized and incor
porated in the Wenatchee valley the
past year made altogether a very cred
itable record. Under the league
method the grower borrows money
from the local banks and is privileged
to sell to whom he pleases, and any
time he pleases, for cash, F. O. 8., or
on consignment if he desires. The
league is made up of units composed
of twenty or more growers and each
unit controls its own affairs. Its mem
bers may sell to whom they see fit at
any price they see fit to accept. The
league supervises the packing and
grading and endeavors to keep the
units posted on market conditions, and
use its best endeavors to find a market
for all the fruit of the members of the
different league units. If the repre
sentatives to the Spokane meeting can
agree on some plan of co-operation on
lines of mutual benefit, under one
head, one of the results will be a wider
distribution of the apples of the mem
bers. In the past, without intelligent
co-operation too many apples have
g»ne to certain large cities with the re
sult that the market was overstocked
and the fruit sacrificed to relieve the
congested condition. To avoid these
conditions is one of the objects of the
formation of a four state league, which
comprises the northwest apple district.
It is quite probable that the lines fol
lowed by the Wenatchee league will
find favor at the Spokrne meeting. If
the organization is perfected , the gov
ernment will also co-operate with the
growers and render much valuable help
by keeping the growers posted as to
rrarket conditions, sire and condition
of crop, estimate of yield in the differ
ent sections of the country with com
parative yield and price in former
years.
Jack Close received the appoint
ment as trainmaster on the G. N.
The appointment wa* held up a few
days last week but was confirmed the
first of this week. Jack is one of the
popular railroad men on this division
and we rejoice at his promotion, tho
we may lose a good citizen.
BOMBARDMENT ROUSES
RESIDENTS IN EAST END
People Thought The Villistas Had Gotten
Here and Were Bombarding
Leavenworth
About four o'clock yesterday morn
ing a number of loud explosions east of
town were heard, followed shortly after
by an awful detonation, and the rattling
of windows and shaking of house?.
Hundreds of people that had not heard
the first skirmishing reports were fully
aroused when the great guns went off
in a salvo of deafening proportions.
One man said the first thought that
came into his mind was that Pancho
Villa had slipt thru the American lines
and was on his way to Canada to force
intervention on the part of the British
government, and wanted to give Leav
enworth people a sample of what he
could do by pulverizing some of the
mountains that surround the town with
his 150-centimeter guns that throw a
projectile weighing 50,000 pounds and
goes half way round the world. Others
were so frightened at the unknown ter
ror, whatever shape or form it had, that
they sat up the balance of the night
fully dressed and ready to flee, or
bravely die, as developments might
show which was the proper thing to do.
When daylight came, shortly fol
lowed by an explanation of the unusual
occurrence, it was found that between
twelve and one o'clock a huge rock,
the size of a house, had gotten loose
on the mountain side 200 feet east of
the Chumstick bridge, and a half mile
from the eastern limits of Leavenworth,
and lodged on the Great Northern
right of way. As soon as it was repoit
ed, a large gang of men was set to
work to get it off the track. Several
charges of dynamite, each containing
ten to IS sticks, were discharged under
the rock without effect. Then a hun
dred sticks were placed on top, covered
with sand, and set off. It had the de
sired effect and fairly pulverized the
huge boulder. The track was cleared
about daylight and the delay in the
passage of the trains due here between
2 and 4:30 a m. was deloyed a short
time only. The last explosion of dyna
mite caused the town to sit up and
take notice.
IMPORTANT HEALTH NOTICE
Don't Throw Garbage on the Snow
All persons are urged not to throw
garbage on the melting snow, as it will
be several weeks before the refuse can
be cleaned up and hauled away, and
in the mean time the garbage soaked
in water and exposed to the sun will
create an unhealthy and dangerously
unsanitary condition. Burn the gar
bage. Clean-up day will be several
weeks later this season than usual and
every precaution must be taken to pro
tect the health of the city under the
adverse circumstances.
