No fire has ever occurred In Tex
as or in tho Southwest to equal the
ono that has just swept over Paris.
Looking north nnd northeast from
the Texas Pacific depot, over an ar
ea whore had stood tho mt-st costly
homes In Paris, only a few scatter
ing residences can be seen. The
ground is covered with debris, elec

ing brief notices of the loss.
Tho Dallas fire department rush
ed a company to the scono of tho fire
and did much toward, stopping the
spread of tho flames.
Household goods moved into the
streets to escape the flames wero all
licked up as the fire raged and ad
vanced to distances unforeseen and
unexpected. Hundreds of families
are sleeping In back yards and in
the streets. Groceries are exceeding
ly scarce, and. much hardship is be
ing experienced. All the cities of
tho section are extending all aid
possible, and the unfortunates are
.being cared for In every way as fast
as arrangements can bo made to get
assistance to them.

Tho case of E. Haggard against O,
B". Hall and D. F, Brown, in which
plaintiff asks damages in tho sum
or $4,700.00, w,pnt to the jury Wed
nesday night. The plaintiff, charges
that defendants by diverting tho

part of Tuesday and all day Wednes
day. Hatchett & Ferguson appear
ed for the dofondants and McPherren
& -Cochran for tho plaintiff.

Tuesday afternoon. Tho to
tal loss is estimated at moro
than $200,000, tho value of
tho cotton loBt being SMB.
'S' '000, fully covered by insur
S anco. The plant of tho com
press company was valued at
$45,000, and was insured for
$20,000. Residence proper
ty was partly Insured. Tho
flro originated fro mthe ex

PROPERTY TRANSFERS ARE
ON THE INCREASE
Judging by tho Increased number
of deeds being recorded in tho office
of tho county clerk, the farm and
city property business Is" picking up.
Cler McCroary reports that deeds re
corded and! bolng recorded now aro
considerably more in number than
for the same period of time last year.
Tho number of chattel mortgages
filed, ho says, is about the same as
last spring. It was believed that the
now usury law, which caused tho
discontinuation of imnll loans by
many banks, would cause a decrease
in the chattel mortgages.
TWO WELLS ARE
REING DRILLED
Drill on Klcrsey Lcnso Struck Wntcr
nnd Quicksand nt 00 nvct -Yfrll
Start Drilling on tho Thompson
Lcnso Next Sntrirday.
Two new oil wells are bolng drill
cd In IiIb community, and it Is f reefy
predicted by oil men that either oil
or gas will bo found. Th-j rapidity
with which scouts aro taking leases
on stuff near and far from botli lo
cations indicates that tho oil men
fool there Is likely to be something
doing. Lease contdderatlona ore
runnlg all tho way from twenty-five
celts to five dollars por acre.
Work has been in progress for
several days on tho well on tho Kler
sey lease, a mile and a quarto to
tho northwost of the town of Kler
soy. At ninety feet the drill struck
a large sheet of- wator and quick
sand which tho most modern typo of
baler was unable to lower an Inch
in tho hole. An extra heavy casing
was lowered into the hole and the
water and sand Bhut out, when the
drilling was resumed. Tho driller,
Mr. Chapman, anticipates finding
still another and larger strata of
quicksand nnd water at between four
and five hundred- feet, and expressed
surprise at finding it at the shallow
depth of ninety feet.
Work on the well on tho Leo
Thompson place, two miles south of
this city, will commence Saturday.
The rig is up and all .the machinery
ana casing are on mo grounu.. xnp

that everything was in good order;
CHILD RUN DOWN
RY AUTOMOBILE
Thellnu Pcrklnson Struck and Drag
ged by Atito Drlvjcn by II. A.Slaton
of Mend Wrenched Ann Is Worst
Injur)- Suffered by tho Child.
A Ford automobile driven by H.
A. Slaton, of Mead, struck llttlo Thol
nta Porklnson, while crossing Main
strept at Seventh Avenue Wednesday
afternoon, knocking her down and
dragging her somo distance before
tho car could be stopped. Tho
wheels did not pass over her body,
but sho was badly bruised and cut
by tho accident, and suffered torn
tondona in tho right arm. Had tho
accident not occurred at a very soft
anl sandy piece of road, more ser
ious injurios would probably have
bejm inflicted. '
Ir. Slaton and his . family were
returning to their nomo nt Mead, go
ing out Main tree;. Tho little child,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Will Per
klnsoil, had started across tho street
kto the little store conducted by her
grandfather, and the persons who
witnessed tho accident say that tho
driver of tho car did not sound his
horn, but that ho did yell at tho
child. Slaton is a one armed man,
and this fact probably made tho
handling of tho car more difficult
for him.
It Was thought at first that ' tho
child had been killed, breath having
beon knocked out of her body by the
force of tho blow; but sho was quick
ly revived, and Is now believed to bo
out of danger. However, the injury
to the arm is quite serlousT

Lieutenant Murchison was here
Friday and inspected the local mili
tia company, reporting the company

THE TROUBLE
IN MEXICO
Two Thousand Cnrranza Soldiers nro
Said to Invo Joined Villa's Ban
dits Censorship g Extended, nnd
Much Uneasiness Is Felt.
From Columbus, Now Mexico, tho
rumor has been given circulation
that Luis Horrera, until recently tho
Carranza military glvornor of Chi
huahua, has ronounco dthe Carranza
cause and announced In favor of
Villa, taking tho field of v.-oatcrn
Chihuahua with 2,000 troop.
Tho same rumor, although uncon
firmed, Is rife In El Paso. The re
port comes there from, two sources,
but no officials would say that the
advlco had gotten beyond tho rumor
stago. It Was pointed out, however,
that more than one half of tho Chi
huahua garrison were former Villa
followors, nnd It was conceded that
such an addition to tho Villa forces
might have somo effect upon tho
bandit's plans and Immediate future
actions.
General Bell has extended tho cen
sorship to make It as thorough and
rigorous as possible, saying that ho
did not Intend news of his prepara
tions to bo given out In advance of
their execution.
Wires of communication with tho
Pershing expedition now In Mexico
are out of commission, and the wire
less service is also useless. For this
reason ilo word has been received
at least nono has been given out)
as to the progress of tho soldiers in
Mexico.
There is a belief that tho Carran
za forces gained a victory over tho
bandits at Namlquipa; but consid
erable doubt exists In official sourc
es as to this, for the reason that had
there been such a victory tho event
would have been loudly acciaimed
by thf do facto government.
Undisguised anxiety is shown over
the report of the disaffection of 'tho
Chlhuahua garrison, and there is an
Increased feeling of uncertainty over
the ppsslble conditions confronting
the expedition "somewhere in Mex
ico." If the Herera report Is true,
there is much fear that it means tho
'joglnning of moro turning of Mexi
can soldiers from Carranza to Villa,
and In considering that It must bo
borno In mind that, according to the
understanding at El Paso; there are
substantial Carranza forces station
ed in positions that would 'permit a
flank movement upon the American
expedition. -
There are persis'.ent and unpleas
ant rumors of treachery on the part
of Carranza soldiers and of conniv
ance between them and the bandit
chioftain. Thero is also an altered
attitude on tho part of Uio Mexicans
at Juarez that Is considered signifi
cant, showing that the natives! aro
not only restless but dissatisfied.
An unofficial report says that Vil
la made his escape after the Nam
quipa encounter with the Carranza
troops, and is supposed to be at San
Miguel about fifteen miles away, at
the foot of the Sierra Madres moun
tains. The report further" says
that General Pershing has two col
umns In closo pursuit, and that ho
used a Mexican Northwestern trfln
to carry part of. his men to a point
near tho Cumbro tunnel, so he could
try to head Villa off at San Miguel.
Carranza officials deny emphati
cally tho revolt of Herera at Chihua
hua. However, should the report bo
true, the Mexicnn problem will havo
become one of the most serious im
port to tho government of tho United
States, and the VHH part of the af
fair may resolve itself into merely
an "Incident" of the conditions lllro
ly to follow further dissatisfaction
and disaffection on the part of tho
various sorts of bo'dlers of the Mex
ican republic.
There is no doubt bat that th-
ffellng general'" . the uopuUce of
the country Pi nntagonltTa to all
' gTioeofiB,, and junt what fprm of
eipresftion this feeling wit! tike in
the immediate future Is plnvly a
