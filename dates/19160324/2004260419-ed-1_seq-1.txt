St. Helens, March 21st.
Editor Mist
Dear Sir: Your last week's Issue
f the Mist contained an article from
Mrs. Mildred Watts, which deserves
to be answered fairly,-squarely and
intelligently, so far as we officials
are able. The women are voters now,
and we who live from office can not
ignore them. We expect them to
write articles, ask questions and soon
become more Intelligent, more ef
ficient along the line of county fin
ances than the men.
As to the $12,000 sinking fund,
will say, that by mistake I called in
too many warrants, yes, $12,000 too
many, one year ago. I should have
ut the money in the banks according
to the law, and received not less than
per cent; or loaned it with the
sanction of the county court upon
real property at not less than 6 per
cent. However, my mistake saved
the interest on the warrants called,
and it is not likely we could have
gotten over 3 per cent from the
banks. Twenty-four thousand dol
lars will be kept out this year for
the sinking fund.
Now, as to our county finances, we
have on the delinquent rolls subject
to collection, as follows:
Ga., on October 24, 1864, ha was
muutercd out of tho service. During
all the time he was fighting he never
received a wound nor was he taken
prisoner.
After ho returned to his home in
Elgin, Iowa, he was married to Azil-
da J. Mngoou, and 10 years ago they
came to St. Helens, whore they have
since lived In comfortable circum
stances. Mr. and Mrs. Lott are de
vout Christians and have the respect
of tho entire community.
Mr. Cox enlisted In Company D,
Twentieth Wisconsin Infantry, June
7, 1802, and served until July 14,
1865. Ho took active part in sev
orul battles, among thorn bolng Perry
Grovo, Van Iluren, Yazoo City,
Brownsville, Moadowvllle, the siege
ugo they came to St. Helens and have
resided hero since. Hoth Mr. and Mrs.
Cox are members of a local church
and aro much Interested in religious
work.
Only one other veteran of the Civil
war resides in St. Helens. He is Co
lumbus L. Ayres, who Is 74 years
old, nnd who hus lived In Columbia
county for the Inst 30 years. Mr.
Ayors served three years In the fam
ous old Eighth Missouri M. S. M.,
and went through several battles, the
more important being Big Blue and
Jefferson City. At one of these places
he received a bullet in his right
cheek, but he was only absent from
roll call a short time.
St. Helens Is proud of Us three
old heroes.

ST. HELENS BAND
WANT UNIFORMS
Ktrunil Gives Ileneflt, First Outdoor
"Hplel" of the Season
Under the leadership of A. Buss,
the St. Helens band ia becoming a
first class musical organization.
There are now 18 pieces regularly
playing and each one is proficient in
the part. At a meeting last week It
was decided to secure uniforms and a
start was made on Tuesday evening,
when Mr. Strom of the Strand Thea
ter, donated the proceeds of the show
that evening to the boys. At 7:15
o'clock the band started playing in
front of the theater and for about 40
minutes kept steadily playing as an
added attraction to the show.
The generous spirit displayed by
Mr. Strom was highly appreciated by
the membership of the band and It
has been suggested that other bus
iness men emulate the example of
the proprietor of the popular show
house.
It is the intention of the band to
provide music on all occasions this
year and a series of concerts are
proposed on the strand or plaza dur
ing the summer.
During April a musical entertain
ment will be given at the city, hall
for the purpose of raising more
money with which to buy uniforms.
The St. Helens band is a credit to the
city and should receive the support
of the citizens.
Total t , . .$113,162.36
We have on the 1915 tax roll In
the-general fund, $166,906.74; we
have on the delinquent rolls, In the
general fund, exclusive of O. & C,
$19,389.24; total, $186,296.08; from
this we take the amount to be paid
out, $113,162.35; leaving a balance
of $73,133.73, applicable to the pay
ment of general fund county war
rants. But if at this time next year,
there are $16,000.00 delinquent on
the 1915 roll, and $12,000.00 on the
back roll, there would be $28,000.00
less, or $4 5,000.00 to apply on gen
eral fund warrants.
We are at present in debt about
$28,000.00 in the general fund. The
disbursements average about $4500
per month In this fund, eo by this
time next year will have approxim
ately $82,000.00 les3 the $45,000.00
applicable to the payment of these
warrants, or about $37,000.00 out
standing warrants, with a delinquent
of $28,000.00 and should we get the
O. & C. L. G., general fund tax,
would be $12,778.58, or a total de
linquent of approximately $40,778.50
to offset the $37,000.00 outstanding
warrants. This of course is only an
approximation. Even the county court
can not tell what expenses they may
have to meet.'
As to the general road fund, we
have about $13,00. 00 In the seven
roud districts, $540O"OO of which is
O. & C. L. G. delinquent tax, which
we may not get, the other $7600.00
when collected can be applied to the
redemption of outstanding general
road warrants, of which we have
about $12,000.00 at present. The
county court can not expend to ex
ceed $16,000.00 more In this fund
during the year, lest they overrun
what they have provided for.
As to the seven road districts, there
are $130,118.42 distributed as per
budget, of this amount there will be
possibly $117,000.00 collected by
this time next year, judging by pre

"SCHOOL SCRIBBLES"
Monday being visiting day in the
Ridgefield school, several teachers
were visiting the High School and
grades.
Nearly one-halt of -the - apelling.
manuscripts' were perfect this morn
ing and the preceding days this
week have been equally as good.
Senior class rings - were ordered
last week which is causing consider
able restlessness among said pupils.
They will soon be registering joy. as
the rings are expected some time this
week.
Several boys are turning out for
track and should develop into an ef
ficient squad under the supervision
of Sten and Ostrander. It is rumored
that we may have a dual meet with
the High. Schools of Ridgefield and
Scappoose. This will be of great
help to the boys as the county meet
Is staged here May 1.
Many of the boys experienced sev
eral evenings of hard practice In base
ball last week but on account of the
hard rains this week, the training has
been rather slack. Coach Sten Is
hoping for more suitable weather
and with the aid of Squad Captain
John Southard, should soon be able
to pick out a winning team. This Is
the first year the school has played
baseball to any extent but witfl the
available material, they should make
some showing. In the near future
Clatskanle plays Rainier and St. Hel
ens crosses bats with Scappoose. The
deciding game for the championship
of the county will be played between
the two winners on May 1, the same
day as the track meet.
LOOKOUT STATION
FOR ST. HELENS
The success of the lookout Btatton
on Mt. Hood has prompted the United
States Forest service to build a sim
ilar structure on the summit of Mt.
St. Helons during the coming sum
mer. The Mt. Hood station proved
invaluable to the forestry service aa
a lookout station during the summer,
and has also proven very convenient
as a shelter from the elements dur
ing stormy seasons in the spring and
fall. The lumber, as in the case of
the Mt. Hood station, will probably
be hauled to the Bnow line and trans
ported by sled up the mountain side.
LATEST ADDITION
The latest addition to the St. Hel
ens list of auto owners is Hayes Eas
terbrook, who brought down from
Portland Wednesday his smart look
ing Overland roadster bought from
Henry McCoy, the local agent here.
Oscar Erlckson of Warren,, also
bought an Overland through the
samo agency. His is a light 5-pas-senger
car.
