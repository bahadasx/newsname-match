Major Sample, of the Six

command of the forces stationed
ut Columbus during tliu liunt
for Pancho Villa. H lias sever
al hundred men under Ills com
mand, and Is taking every
precaution to guard against a
surprise atUict by hostile Mex
icans. This is the base of
supplies for the army in Mexico,
and there Is no danger or Colum
bus being left without ample
protection as a strong gurlson
must be kept here to guard the
military supplies as well as the
citizens and private property.
Our people have absolutely no
need for any fear of attact and
ean continue their business as
usual, with a feeling that every
thing is as safe and secure as if
I hey were located hundreds of
miles from the border. Major
Sample Is a man that wo can
rely upon and one that will take
very means to furnish us pro

HE CAN FILL YOVR ORDER.
Since the Villa mid on the
morning of March Oth, the long
distance telephone line out of
Columbus has hardly been idle
for a moment. Calls have been
received from Now York, Chlca
go, Pittsburg and many other
eastern cities. One year ago it
would not have been possible to
talk from Columbus to New
York City, but it lias been made
possible by means of repcatorH,
which were tlrst installed last'
July, and it is now possible to
hear a voice thousands of miles
away as distinctly as if it was in
anothor part of your wn town
Several telephones have been
installed by Manager Burton in
the Military camp, and the Slg
nal Corps have installed a pri
vate branch exchange in the
camp for their own use. Mr.
Burton is building a new ex
change building just west of the
M. E. Church, which he ex
pects to have completed within
a few weeks and will then be
able to take care of the business
much better than is possible at
the present time.
Colors Firtt to Cross
On Wednesday at exactly 1:00,
Marcli 15, the Regimental colors
of the Thirteenth Cavalry cross-
d the International boundry
line on tlio expedition after the
Villa Bandits. The colors,
closely followed by Colonel Slo
cum's staff, crossed and the
command "Halt" was immediate"
ly given. The troops dismount
ed and adjusted their saddles.
The command was mounted in a
few moments, and at the com
mand "march" the regiment
passed into Mexico, Troop K
leading the way. This troop
was used as tliu advanced guard.
and immediately swung out to
the right nnd left, forming a line
h mile long in cacli direction and
considerably in advance of the
main column
The Thirteenth passed into
Mexico without any ceremony
or any outw.rd expression on
the part of the men, but it was
plainly visible that every man
was delighted to have the
opportunity of going. About
8,000 men were in the first ex
pedltion from here and since
that time Koveral large forces
have joined them. Two regi
ments entered from points west
of here the following day after
the first troops entered from

Nrt Nri
The army officers have the local situation
entirely under control and are using every effort
to keep false rumors from being circulated.
There has really been no reason for excitement
at any time since the raid as the soldiers have
been keeping a close lookout. The Villa attack
would have amounted to but little had the U.
S. Troops been expecting him. The attack
was a complete surprise, which was Villa's vic
tory and what our troops are not going to let
happen again. American soldiers outnumbered
five to one or even more if not taken unaware
can easily handle the situation and a surprise
attack is the only thing wc have to ear, which
is entirely impossible. Aside from the fact that
that there are no armed Mexicans within 75
miles of Columbus and large bodies of American
soldiers in large numbers between us, Major
Sample sends patrols out in every direction.
Business was never better here than it is now
and everyone should go on about his own busi
ness as if nothing had ever happened. No
place in the Southwest offers more business
opportunities than Columbus, and we are far
better protected than any other city or town.
It's a case of 'locking the stable after the horses
were stolen' of couse, but those who had planned
to settle in Columbus or the Lower Mimbres
need not hesitate no more now than they would
to go to Baltimore because the city was once
destroyed by fire.
More People Arriving
On account of the wonderful
increase in amount of business
done by the post office at this
place of late, Mrs. J. W. Blair
and Mrs. Arthur Beck have been
added to tlio force to handle the
mail. Quite an addition is being
built to the present postoftice
building, which will be complet
ed in a very few days, and
doubtless make ample room for
some time to come. The depart
ment has had two or three men
hero for several days helping to
relieve the congested condition
of the mail, caused by the addi
tlon of so many soldiers here
and in Mexico, and the congre
gating of so manv people here
for business and other reasons.
Columbus is no longer a town;
but is a city and expects to soon
have a post office of the first
class.
When Columbus was struck
lately by the calamity that every
body most has read of, It was
not a town of brown tents, as
somebody has written; but as
you can sec by pictures taken
before the raid by Villa, has
many two Btory brick buildings.
Only a fow of the xrood struct
ures wore burned.

have cml led an election on Tues
day, April 4th, for the purpose
of electing a now board to con
trol the city affairs for the next
two years. From all indications
the next two years will be the
best that Columbus has ever
seen and it Is up to us to elect
a board composed of our best
business men. We have plenty
of good material to make a board
that we can feel proud of, and
the thing to do is to put up out-
good men.
Mr. Hoover our present may
, lias given perfect satUfnc
tion in every way, and would be
the choice of thn voters for an
other term, but he declines the
honor. Dr. Dabncy as a member
of the present board has taken a
great Interest in the city affairs,
and we do not believe a better
man could bo found for the
position of mayor. C. It. Rogers,
W. F. King, Albert Weld, J. R.
Osborne, J. L. Greenwood, J. P.
White, J. L. Walker and many
others could be chosen for the
trustees, and any four of the
men mentioned abovo would fill
the offices with credit and abili
ty. The election is only ten
days off and a complete ticket
should be nominated at once.
No one wants the job but it is a
duty that must be done by some
one and we believe that any of
the men mentioned above will in
duty bound accept the job if
asked to by the qualified voters
of the Village.
Settle on Columbus Route
The much discussed questiqn
of the road between Deming
and Columbus was definitely
settled when the Luna county
road board met and decided on
the route to be followed. Start
ing from Deming the road goes
south to the Lindauer ranch,
where it turns east for three
quarters of a mile, thence south
for one mile, turning east again
two miles, and thence straight
south to Columbus. The 70
draw will be bridged on the
railroad grade.
AH the members of the board
wore present at tlio meeting,
and S. W. Alray, the board's
engineer, was instructed to
start a survey at onco for the
purpose of estimating the cost
of the proposed road and bridge.
As soon as Mr. A! my has com
pleted his estimate he will sub
mit it to the board and work
will begin within the next sixty
days. Headlicht.

bate Court of Luna County

Columbus and vie inity enjoyed
auood rain Thursday uvunlng
A nice shower fell Wodnosday
afternoon, an ther o was evl -
dence of a light snow 1 rluay
morning though tho sun soon
removed all traces.
Lemmon & Rouinoy, who lost
their store by tire, arc opening
up in the old postoftice building.
Their loss was total, as they
cannot collect their insurance.
They will soon have a complete
stock of fresh groceries and will
be pleased to have all their old
customers call on them in their
new quarters.
Tliis is tho second time Lorn
mon & Romney have lost every
thing by Mexican bandits. Their
property was all destroyed by
tire In their old home in Mexico
about four years ago by Mexican
naudits and at that time they
were unable to collect a cent of
their insurance. It is very
discouraging for them and not
many men would have tho cour
age to try agaia.
Such enterprising people are
a great asset to a town and they
certainly deserve our admiration.
They will have one of the best
locations in town and wih be
pleased to receive your patron
age.
Their loss in the the raid
amounts to about $5,000. Sam
Ravel was probably the biggest
looser having lost three business
buildings Including the Com
mercial hotel building, in which
hbK jore room was located. His
losty -as not less than $10,000.
Mr.. Ritchie's loss was large,
thoi uii it Is at present almost
impossible to estimate. B. M.
Reed' lost his real estate office
ncluding all his office fixtures,
i. L. Walker had about $.100
worth of ammunition, guns and
saddles taken. The other losses
were not so large, the plate glass
probably being the major portion.
It is very unfortunate that
the insurance cannot be collected
but all policies contain clauses
that makes the policy of no value
n a case of this kind. It will
bo up to our government to
collect the loss from the Mexi
can government, though it will
probably be several years before
anything can be actually realized.
