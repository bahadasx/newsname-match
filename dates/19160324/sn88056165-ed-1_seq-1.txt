MORE TALK ON
HOG MARKET
Seattle Writer Takes U. S.
Department Official to Task
Over Remarks as to North
west Market Cunditions.
The following article was sent
out from Seattle this week, pre
sumably from a packing house
source, and is reproduced for the
benefit of our readers for any
possible light it may throw cn
recent and present hog market
conditions:
Charles J. Brand, chief of the
division of markets of the U. S.
department of agriculture, asked
by Senator Jones for his views
on the condition of the market
for hogs in the northwest, inti
mated in a statement that on ac
c >unt of its location in relation to
other market centers the Pacific
n irthwest is virtually a market
in itself and "therefore is some
what limited in so far as the de
mands for meat products are con
c.-rned." This fact, he says,
coupled with the enormous in
crease in production has been
cited by some market authorities
as indicative of the overproduc
tion of hogs in the northwest ter
ritory.
Students of hog and cattle con
ditions in the northwest as well
as in other parts of the U. S. are
laughing at Brand's statement.
It would be a joke but for the
fact that it comes from an official
of the department of agriculture,
whose business is supposed to be
along the lines of building up,
and not destroying the hog in
dustry. If there is an over-pro
duction ef hogs in the northwest,
if the market is limited, why the
present splendid price for hogs,
why the contracts for early sum
mer delivery at even higher prices
than are being paid today; if
there is an over-production per
haps Mr. Brand can explain why
from 136 to 932 carloads of hogs
have been shipped every year
since 1908 (1915 included) from
Nebraska and South Dakota just
to meet the requirements of one
Seattle packing house alone? To
this should be added the hogs
shipped from these points to
packers in Spokane, Tacoma and
Portland, also the enormous a
mount of finished packing house
products, which are constantly
being shipped here from Missouri
river points.
It is true that for a short time
hog prices were lower in the
northwest than in the east. It
will probably never occur again.
r i he explanation as to why it did
occur is simple enough. The
grtat European war came on sud
denly, wheat jumped sky high,
eastern growers dumped their
bogs on the market by the thou
sands, yes by tens of thousands,
the beef trust finding itself with
this surplus stock on hand, sought
t j demoralize the northwest mark
et by shipping this surplus out
here; at the same time northwest
hog growers, swept off their feet
by high wheat prices, turned
their hogs, most of them in an
inferior condition, on the market.
This surplus glutted the north
west market temporarily but the
northwest packers soon cleaned
it up. Then the prices of hogs
again began to jump and today
every grower in the northwest
who continued in the hog busi
ness is reaping his financial re
ward and those who temporarily
abandoned the game are sorry
they did so and are hurrying to
get back into it.
Students of conditions in the
northwest say that instead of
there being an over-production
there is really an under-produc
tion. The fact that northwest
is
of
to
of
packers say they will be shipping
hogs in from the middle west be
fore the summer is over is pretty
good evidence that this is true.
They will probably pay for these
hogs a dollar more than the pre
vailing Omaha prices. There is
not a packing house~in the north
west that could not take care right
today of more hogs if they could
get them. This will be particu
larly true with the ending of the
European war. U. S. meats will
then be in great demand abroad,
and northwest packers expect to
ship via thq big canal their prod
ucts, not only to Europe, but to
the Atlantic seaboard. Investi
gation justifies the statement
that they can well afford to do
this in competition with eastern
packers. Furthermore, the mark
ets of the northwest are growing
day by day; the population is on
the jump. Hogs from now on
will be in greater demand it is
predicted than ever before in the
history of the northwest, and it
is up to the department of agri
culture, if it wishes to serve the
purposes for which it was created
ty the people to encourage the
great hog industry which years
of experience has proven is the
real mortgage raiser on every
successful American farm.
John Uhlorn is Victim
of Pneumonia
John Uhlorn, a prominent farm
er of the Ferdinand section, died
at his home southeast of that
place Tuesday afternoon after a
short illness with pneumonia.
The deceased, who was a half
brother of Joseph Schmidt, of
Greencreek, took sick about the
time the latter was stricken with
his la3t illness and followed his
brother to the great beyond al
most within a week, their deaths
occurring within eight days of
each other almost to the hour.
When Mr. Uhlorn was taken ill
Dr. Turner was called and did
everything possible to stay the
ravages of the disease but in vain.
The deceased was about sixty
years of age and was born in
Greencreek, Illinois. He was
married there to Miss Mary Nux
oll and resided there for a num
ber of years, coming to Idaho
some fourteen years ago and set
tling on his present farm near
Ferdinand where he has resided
since that time. Five children
were born to this union, four of
whom are still living. The de
ceased was a kind and loving
husband and father, an honest
and upright-citizen and neighbor,
and a thorough Christian. He
leaves a wife, four children,
many relatives and countless
friends to mourn his untimely
death.
The funeral was held yesterday
morning at 9 o'clock from the
Ferdinand Catholic church and
was quite largely attended, many
going from this place to attend
the last rites.
The Chronicle joins with friends
of the family in extending sym
pathy to them in their hour of
sorrow.
Charles Bentz Dead
Charles Bentz, pioneer of Idaho
county, died suddenly at 8 o'clock
Wednesday morning at his home
near Whitebird, the cause of his
death being heart failure. Mr.
Bentz came to Idaho county more
than 40 years ago and was well
known in all sections. During
the early days he was identified
with mining operations in the
Warrens and other camps, but
for many years followed farming
and stock raising in the prairie
country. He was a gentleman
of fine qualities and was always
identified with movements in
tended to benefit the community.
He was about 73 years of age and
is survived by a wife and several
children.
Father
Used to wonder just why father
Never had much time for play.
Used to wonder why he'd rather
Work each minute of the day.
Used to wonder why he never
Loafed along the road an' shirked ;
Can't recall the time whenever
Father played while others worked.
Father didn't dress in fashion,
Sort of hated clothing new, m
Style with him was not a passion,
He had other things in view.
Boys are blind to much that's going
On about 'em day by day,
And I had no way of knowing
What became of father's pay.
All I knew is when I needed
Shoes I got 'em on the spot;
Everything for which I pleaded
Somehow, father always got.
Wondered season after season,
Why he never took a rest,
And that I might be the reason
Then I never even guessed.
Father set a store of knowledge,
If he'd lived to have his way
He'd have sent me off to college
And the bills been glad to pay.
That I know was his ambition,
Now and. then he used to say
He'd have done his earthly mission
On my graduation day.
Saw his cheeks were growing paler,
Didn't understand just why,
Saw his body growing frailer,
Then at last I saw him die.
Rest had come ! His tasks were ended,
Calm was written on his brow;
Father's life was big and splendid,
And I understand it now'.

Idaho's Products
And Resources
From Robert N. Bell, state in
spector of mines for Idaho, comes
in fine form the seventeenth an
nual report of the mining indus
try of the Gem state.
Zinc seemed to have had the
call last year and the gross value
of the metals and bullion shipped
from Idaho for 1915 is put down
as approximately $39,000,000.
The Coeur d'Alene district is
still the banner district. Its yield
of zinc increased 100 per cent,
and if the demand continues an
other 100 per cent increase is |
looked for this year. The lead j
product aggregated 368,000,000
pounds. The yield of silver was
about as usual and the copper
output was 7,000,000 pounds.
The average yield of gold was
realized. Careful statistics are
given of the working of individ
ual mines, the improvements
made, the accidents suffered.
By the introduction of refineries
great saving in frieghts is ex
pected this year. Several new
smelters are being built and the
electric power supply is being
largely increased.
Mr. Bell believes Idaho is the
richest state in the Union in nat
ural resources. He backs his be
lief with big figures.
The report is most interesting
and instructive through its entire
134 pages.
Dr. Blake and son, Ed, were in
town yesterday from Keuteryille.
John Forsmann came up from
Clarkston the first of the week to
look after business interests.
Hayward Shields has taken
Rosie Huffman's place on the

sent in Montana.
Percy Campbell came in from
Montana Tuesday evening and fs
visiting here Tor a few days. He
sold his shop at Deer Lodge and
is now looking for anew location.
