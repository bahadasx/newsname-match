Several reasons why more peanuts
should be raised In Texaa were given
Wednesday by II. R. Herndon of the
Industrial Congress, with headquarters
in Iallas. who is in Houston attend
lug the Cattle Raisers' Association
convention.
"We are Juxt getting rexponses
from the oil mill trade." said Mr.
Herndon, "In answer to circular let
ters we sent out asking about the ex
lent of the local market for peanut
products. This Is a matter of Interest
to the farmer Just no'.
"We wanted to know how many oil
mllla are preparing to crush peanuts
this year. On Monday when I left
the office the letters we had received
Indicated that there would be a mar
ket for 75(1.000 bushelt. Ijuit year the
marketed pmdort - re pre swwted 4f,Atfi
bushels. This doea not represent all
the crop grown, for thousands of tons
were baled nuts and all for hay, be
isuse the oil mills had not worked up
the business.
"Not less than forty mill are pre
paring to handle the 1116 crop. One
oil mill got 22.000 gallons of oil from
400 tons of nuts of the 1.(15 crop, and
It was found that all tha oil could
hr readily aotd, but the stock feeders
were Inclined to be rather conserva
tive about using the )eanut meal as a
feeding equivalent to cotton seed rake.
The feeders will have to be educated
to use peanut meal. In 1911 when the
price of cotton fell below the cost of
production the question arose on the
part of live atock feedera as to where
some cheap protein product could be
had.
"The peanut la rich in protein.
about 3 per cent greater than cotton
seed, and Is extremely useful as a
balunclng ration used with corn or
grain sorghum heads.
"If conditions arise in the future to
make It necessary to quit raising cot
ton the peanut will serve equally well
or better. The feeders should not be
conservative about the use of peanut
meal." Houston Post.
