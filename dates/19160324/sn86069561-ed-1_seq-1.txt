correspondent says the reason
that he failed to write a letter for
the Signal week beforejlast, was
that he accompanied a Democrat
ic friend of ours to the Republi
can convention at ijouisviiie.
Well, we are glad that he did this
for eur friend, but what we can't
quite understand is why a Demo
crat could be so overjoyed when
the Republicans themselves had
do much confusion and discord.
But, perhaps this is why he en
joyed himself so well, "-for it is!a
melancholly fact that the opposite
likes to see just such things arrise
in the camp of their political ene
mies, and we guess the- reason
that the correspondent would not

That Knoxville business men
never let an opportunity pass to
please their friends and custom
ers, is shown by the recent an
nouncement that they have, at
great expense, fengaged a well
known motion picture maker to
accompany tnem on their rirst
Trade Trip, to make pictures of
the "special" from the time it
leaves the depot at Knoxville nn
till it returns.
Pictures will be made of the
crowds that greet the Trade Tr,ip
party at every stop of the train,
and many pictures will be tuken
of the streets and business holfses
in cities visited. Many pictures
will be made here, and the Knox
ville party has expressed a wish
that as many people arrange ,to
be in the picture as possible, as
the pictures will not- only- be
shown in Knoxville, but wdfalo
be shown here and in all other
towns visited, as well.
As the Trade Trip special will
stop in 43 towns in Tennessee",
Kentucky, Virginia, and North
Carolina, the pictures willproVe a
big advertisement tor Mt. Ver
nou; if a good showing is made.
Everybody should turn out atid
give the '.'special" a rousing wel

showing for our town.
The picture which will be be
tween two and three thousand
feet in length, will be shown here

The famous Cincinnati circus
name, "John Robinson," has
passed into the hands of John Ma
Gavin and Bert Bowers, circus
men of Montgomery, Ala., ac
cording to a message received in
Cincinnati Friday night from
Miami, Fla., where the deal was
closed, says the Cincinnati En
quirer. "The John Robinson
Shows" was a (Cincinnati institu
tion for more than, fifty years, and
and its fame spread throughout
the world. What "Governor?'
John P...Robinspn was paid for
the nameand property was nqt
mentioned, but it is believed that
the amount was large. T.be origi
nal John Bobinson, who founded
the circus was a native of Utica,
N.Y., and with Gil Eldridge,
went into the snow business m
I844 with -a few wagons, an ele
phant and six cages of animals.
In 1856 Robinson became a resi
dent of Cincinnati, at which time
he purchased the Flagg & Ay mar
show. He died in l&Sl at theage
of 82. Col.. Johnny :"wflso,rr, well
