OFFICIAL DENIAL IS MADE
OF REPORTED JUNCTION
OF HERRERA AND VILLA
American Consul at Chihua
hua Brands Rumored
Revolt as Untruth.
FUNSTON IS WORRIED
General Has Reports Con
firming Act of Mutiny
Take Letcher's Word.
Washington, March 24.
The question of calling the
national guard for border
duty to release regulars for
service in Mexico was dis
cussed at today's cabinet
meeting, but it was decided
there was no prospect of
such action at this time.
Washington, March 24. American
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua today re
ported there was no truth in the re
ported revolt of General Herrera and
the t'arranza garrison at Chihuahua.
Although General Funston and Gen
eral Bell on the border have received
reports confirming the story of the re
volt, which they believe to be true, the
dispatch from Consul Letcher, who is
on the ground and has headquarters
at the place where the revolt was said
to have occurred, is taken by officials
here as confirming the statements of
Carranza officials that no such revolt
has occurred.
Consul Letcher's dispatch reportd
that General Herrera was in command
of the le facto troops there and was
"loyal to General Carranza."
His report is regarded as removing
one of the most menacing obstacles
featuring the Mexican situation.
Major General Funston sent this
telegram to the war department:
"General Herrera in a telegram to
General Gavir strongly denies all re
ports that he has gone over to Villa.
General Gutierrez, governor of Chi
fcuhua, in a letter to General Gavira,
also strongly denies that General Her
rera has gone over to Villa."
Fear UlacK On Border.
Conflicting reports of the massing
of Carranza troops on the border con
tinued to reach here today.
Senator Ashurst of Arizona, how
ever, received today from D. A. Rich
ardson, of Douglas, a telegram saying
a Mexican general with 3,000 cavalry
and 40 pieces of artillery had arrived
at a point over the border not more
than 10 blocks from the center of the
city and that 7,000 additional Car
ranza cavalry were six miles south
of the border.
Richardson's telegram follows:
"Mexican general has 40 pieces of
artillery and 3,000 cavalry stationed
10 block from center of Douglas. Sev
en thousand cavalry six miles south of
Douglas. We have only 1,800 infan
try, 300 cavalry and four pieces of ar
tillery. Our troops stationed two
miles east of Douglas. Am reliably
informed that it would take one hour
for our troops to reach Douglas in
ease of night attacks. Our army for
bidden by administration from making
any active defense preparations for
fear Mexicans might misconstrue such
preparation. Mexicans have en
trenched against United States side
and have barbed wire entanglements.
We have no entrenchments. Mexican
troops could easily repeat Columbus
massacre in Douglas on much larger
fale and return to Mexico with simi
lar loss. All of these statements can
be verified by our army officers here.
Help us if you can before it is too
late."
Tired of Senate Process.
Senator Ashurst said he knew Rich
ardson and regarded his information
as authoritative.
"I am giving this telegram for pub
lication," said Senator Ashurst, "and
'ill not even submit it to the senate
because it would be useless. I am
tired of trying to get anything done."
Situation Uncertain.
The Mexican situation was more
confused and uncertain today than at

PROBE SALES OF
LEMON EXTRACT
Stale to Investigate Large Purchases
of Product in Pry Territory
of Illinois
Springfield, Til., March 24. An in
vestigation of the alleged heavy sale
of lemon extract in dry territory in
Illinois is planned, it was learned here
today, by the state pure food commis
sion. Itinerant venders of patent med
icine, it is alleged, carry as one of
their most profitable lines a stock of
lemon extract, which, it is charged,
contains alcohol far in excess of rec
ognized standards.
"There is far more kick in a glass
of 'three star' lemon extract than in
good whisky," said a state official, who
is interested in the investigation. "Per
sons accustomed to stimulants will
travel far and suffer much to get a
'gingle.' Such persons develop a sort
of free masonry among themselves.
"The suspected medicine peddlers,
we understand, have no difficulty in
disposing of a supply of lemon ex
tract to thirsty householders in dry
territory who, when given a sample,
readily appreciate its properties. On
the contrary, a person not feeling the
need of stimulants would be slow to
recognize the effects of the alcohol.
Hence, the authorities do not discover
the violation of the dry laws."
It is understood that the suspected
peddlers travel across the country in
wagons and sell, in addition to the
kmon extract, patent medicine.
PLEA FOR HEART
BALM ISHeiED
Housekeeper Allowed Only Wages in
Her $10,000 Breach of Promise
Suit at Des Moines.
Des Moines, Iowa, March 24. Dam
ages for breach of promise cannot be
collected in Iowa, when the person
against whom the allegation of bad
faith is made, is inflicted with an in
curable disease, according to a ruling
handed down by the Iowa supreme
court late yesterday.
The decision was handed down in
the case of Nancy Bowie of Carroll
county, who asked $10,000 from the
estate of Edward A. Oldfield. Plain
tiff charged that she acted as Old
field's housekeeper from 1893 to 1910
and that he promised to marry her.
Later Oldfield, she said, found he was
suffering from pernicious anemia,
which would cause his death in a few
months, and he refused to marry her.
The court awarded the plaintiff
$3,164 as payment for her services as
housekeeper but refused to give her
anything on her breach of premise
charge.
Beer Price Atrain Raised.
Budapest, March. The price of beer
in Austria-Hungary has been raised
for the third time since the war start
ed, this time by $1.50 per hectolitre (22
gallons) and two cents a glass. Be
fore the war a glass of beer in a res
taurant cost four cents; now it is ten
cents. The breweries justify the in
creases by announcing that it is al
most impossible for them to procure
materials, especially barley.

Save Life of
Doctor Held
for Murders
New York, March 24. District At
torney Swann said today that he would
arraign Dr. Arthur Warren Waite for
the murder of his father-in-law, John
E. Peck, a millionaire druggist of
Grand Rapids, Mich., as soon as
Waite's physical condition would per
mit bringing him to court The young
dentist Is under arrest at his apart
ment and so far recovered from the
effects of narcotics taken. Wednesday
and yesterday that the district attor
ney hoped to produce him in court
before the end of the day.
Investigation of the deaths of John
E. Peck and his wife in Dr. Waite's
Riverside Drive home, under circum
stances which led the authorities to
believe they were the victims of pois
on, continued today. The grand jury
heard further evidence as rapidly as
it was made available by a big squad
of detectives. Mr. and Mrs. Warren
Waite, father and mother of the man
who is accused of administering pois
on to Mr. Peck, are expected to ar
rive here today. It is possible they
will be examined before the grand
jury tomorrow.
Among the exhibits upon which the
authorities are working are medical
books taken from Dr. Waite's library
! containing marked passages describ
ing the effect of poison such as that
alleged to have caused the death of
Mr. Peck.
The Peck mystery is regarded by
the authorities as one of the most ex
traordinary cases they have had to
deal with in years. Mrs. Anna Maria
Peck died in Dr. Waite's apartment
at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, Jan. 30.
The body was cremated at Detroit.
John E. Peck died in Dr. Waite's
rooms Sunday morning, March 12,
and his body was embalmed and start
ed for Grand Rapids that day.
One of the undertakers who pre
pared Mrs. Peck's body for shipment
to Detroit recalled today that they
were compelled to make great haste
to piaee -t4e--body on board thetraln
leaving here on the afternoon of the
day of her death. One of them said
the body was still limp five hours af
ter embalming, indicating to him that
there was something present strong
enough to counteract the effects of
the embalming fluids.
The identity of the woman who, ac
cording to Dr. Waite's admission to
the district attorney, was registered
with him at a hotel as Dr. and Mrs.
W. Walters, has not been disclosed by
the authorities. They intimate, how
ever, it is not likely she knew of the
alleged murder. It is stated that af
ter Dr. Waite returned from Grand
Rapids after taking Mr. Peck's body
to that city, he directed the woman to
leave the hotel and she has not been
seen there since.
Dr. Waite's prominence as a sports
man and tennis player has increased
the interest in the case here. He won
the Metropolitan indoor championship
here early in the season and figured
in the national championship when
he was defeated by R. Lindley Murray,
who won the title.
Dr. Waite's condition had so im
proved during the forenoon that Dis
trict Attorney Swann gave orders that
he should be brought to the Tombs
court for arraignment later in the day.
Detectives on guard at his apartments
were instructed not to relax their
watch for a minute.
Having recovered from his state of
coma, Dr. Waite told his guards, ac
cording to reports they made to the
district attorney, that he would keep
his lips sealed as to the identity of
the woman with whom he lived at a
hotel as Dr. and Mrs. A. W. Walters.
"And I will stick to her," he was
quoted as saying. "I will not give her
up." The grand jury meanwhile re
sumed consideration of the case with
Dr. A. A. Moore, the physician who has
been attending Waite, under summons
to appear as a witness.

Paris, March 24, 11:45 a. m. There
has been no change in the situation
around Verdun since yesterday, ac
cording to the war office announce
ment of this afternoon. West of the
Meuse the night was calm. East of
the river there were intermittent bom
bardments. The text of the statement follows:
"In the Argonne district our bat
teries last night connonaded with en
ergy the enemy positions in the wood

German War Report
Berlin, March 24 (via London, 3:20
p. m.) Further successes have been
won by the Germans in the vicinity of
Haucourt, northwest pf Verdun, army
headquarters announced today, two
additionaI"trenches having been occu
pied. v
On the Russian front the vicious
attacks on the German lines in the
northern sector have been continued,
both northwest and south of Dvinsk.
All the assaults broke down, the
statement declares.
Russians Rush Germans.
The importance of the struggle
around Verdun naturally overshad
owed interest in the contest on the
eastern front, but the latest dispatches
show that hard fighting is in progress
in the northern sector of the Russian
lines.
The Russian drum fire became in
tense on the evening of March 19.
More than 50,000 shells, chiefly of
heavy calibre, fell over a small sec
tion of the front near Postavy. Ger
man wire entanglements and the front
line trenches were damaged by this
fire.
At night the Russians attacked in
thick waves. The first two waves
were mowed down before they reach
ed the entanglements. The third at
tack pierced the German position on
a front of less than 100 yards and the
assailants were ejected by a counter
attack led in person by a regimental
commander. At dawn the Russians
made a fourth attack, but it was
smothered in the initial stages by
German artillery.
Admit HeaTy losses.
Four Russian divisions are said to
have participated in these movements.
The German losses were heavier than
on the two preceding days of the fight
ing on account of the Russian drum
fire, but it is asserted that neverthe
less they were surprisingly small.
Comparative quiet prevailed on
March 19 along the sector between
Wiszniew and Narocz lakes, except
for a strong night attack of the Rus
sians which was repulsed.
The losses sustained by the Rus
sians in these encounters are said to
have been very heavy. Notwithstand
ing the severity of the actions, no
concern is evident here. The state of
public feeling was expressed by a cor
respondent, who said:
"The people have no anxiety be
cause they know Hindenburg is there."

Need Troops
of Pershing
For Capture
Douglas, Ariz., March 24.
General P. Elias Calles,
military governor of Sonora,
received a telegram today
from General Enriquez, mil
itary governor of Chihuahua,
stating that five columns of
Carranza troops were clos
ing in on Villa and his ban
dits near Namiquipa and that
with the aid of the Ameri
cans, it was believed that
Villa would not be able to
escape.
Governor Enriquez also tele
graphed that the reports concern
ing the revolt of General Herrera
were false and an effort by the
"radicals" to cause trouble be
tween the Carranza government
and the United Slates.
The Mexican troops operating
near Namiquipa, according to
General Enriquez, were those un
der the command of General Cava-
zoa, General Graza, Colonel Cano,
Colonel Saiasa and Colonel Her
nandez. General Calles also received a
telegram today from General Luis
Hererra at Chihuahua City in which
the latter denied emphatically
that he had revolted against the
Carranza government and had
joined Villa.
Sixty cases of rifle cartridges
were delivered to General Calles
at Agua Prieta, Each case con
tained one thousand rounds.
El Paso, March 24. No word has
come to military headquarters here
early today to confirm a report that
United States troops and the Car
ranza army had surrounded Villa and
his men and a battle was imminent.
The report was received by Mexican
Consul Andreas Garcia.
The Villa outlaws were ffcPbe
hemmed in at El Oso, about five miles
south of Namiquipa, where Villa had
fled after a conflict with the Carranza
forces at Santa Gertrudes. Villa, ac
cording to a dispatch from General
Bertani, Carranza commander in the
field of operations, made a stand in
the Santa Clara canyon near Santa
Gertrudes, but was driven out with a
loss of several men killed and 100
horses captured.
Information regarding the impend
ing battle at El Oso was expectantly
awaited today. Brigadier General Bell
at Fort Bliss was without information
regarding General Pershing's forces,
whose strategic moves in the Chihua
hua district have been cloaked in
strict silence. Apparently General
Pershing is making his own plans of
campaign and executing them with
out reporting to Major General Fun
ston. HAY'S ARMY BILL

Sydney, N. S. W., March 24. Lieu
tenant Sir Ernest H. Shackleton has
returned from his Antarctic expedition.
News of the achievements of the expe
dition is withheld for the present.
The adventure of Lieutenant Sir
Ernest Shackleton, heading the British
trans-Arctic expedition, had a three
fold purpose; to navigate Antarctic
on a meridian; to secure for the Brit
ish flag the honor of being the first
national emblem thus to be taken
from sea to sea across this south polar
realm, and to conduct scientific work
relating, among other phases, to meteo
rology, geography, geology and geo
detic survey. The expedition was
financed, for the most part, by large
gifts from persons interested in polar
explorations. Funds amounting to
more than $300,000 were raised, in
cluding $50,000 from the British gov
ernment. The expedition left England in two
sections about six weeks after the
European war began, but it was not
until early in January, 1915, after de
lay due to unfavorable ice conditions,
that the party headed by Sir Ernest
himself set off on a 1,700 mile voyage
from South Georgia, an uninhabited
island in the south Atlantic ocean
about 800 miles due east of Cape Horn,
for Ross sea, on the other side of the
south pole.

In General Pershing's report.
Columbus, N. M., March 24 (cen
sored). The American campaign to
capture Francisco Villa has reached
the point in the foothills of Chihuahua
where it has been found necessary to
dispense with heavy motor trucks as
transport facilities and to depend en
tirely upon the army pack mule, it
was learned here today. It is known
that the trucks have encountered many
difficulties in the sandy region tnrougn
which the troops have passed. Motor
trains probably will be used, however,
for transport purposes between Co
lumbus and the advanced base at
Casas Grandes.
Forces Endure Hardships.
lJI'Wt&lmlSn-:EdTance Into Chihua
hua is proving a hard, gruelling march
in which both animals and men are
enduring great hardships, although at
many turns presenting spectacular
military parades, according to reports
brought here today by J. C. Marlowe
of Douglas. Marlowe, who is the first
nf the civilians who started eight days
ago with the expeditionary force to
reach the border, asserted tnat tne
army is more and more realizing its
utter dependency on the knowledge of
the country shown by the civilian
scouts.
Arriving on a motor truck train
after a 30-hour ride over rutted, dust
filled road, from near Casas Grandes,
Marlowe was a vivid example of the
physical difficulties of the march. His
face was gaunt, burned and blistered
by the oppressive glare of the desert
sun. A week's growth of beard was
caked with alkali dust, his clothing
marked by many encounters with
cactus and mesquite.
Americans Unmolested.
Lieutenant J. L. Parkinson of Salt
Lake City, Utah, who was in charge of
the trucks on which Marlowe arrived,
reported that all of the American
trucks and drivers have been account
ed for and that American troops have
not clashed with any Mexican force
since crossing the border.
