Palatkans are not going- to take
kindly to the idea of losing Mr. and
Mrs. F. L. Thorpe, for the past four
years resident s of this city and prom-'
ment in our social and church circles.
Mr. Thorpe has been requested to
take over the management of the bus
iness of the Southern Bell Telephone
& Telegraph" Co. at Orlando, where
the exchange has double the number
of subscribers the company has in
Palatka. The change is distinctly a
promotion for Mr.' Thorpe, the place
carrying a large increase of salary
and, of course, greater responsibil
ties. He will assume his new duties
in that city on April 1st, which
means that Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe will
leave Palatka sometime next week.
During his administration of the af
fairs of the company in this city the
business has doubled and the growth
continues. The service is also the
best, a fact that is due largely to
Mr. Thorpe's influence.
Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe have been ac
tive in the social and religious life of
Palatka during the four years of their
residence, and it is in these circles
that they will be the more greatly
missed. Mrs. Thorpe has been among
the leaders in every good work for
the moral welfare of the city and
prominent in the work of the Presby
terian church in which she has long
been the leader of the Philatheas.
She is also a member of the choir of
this church and has interested her
self in increasing interest in musical
culture in the city. She possesses a
fine voice.
Palatka will miss these good peo
ple, and while they must rejoice in
this business advancement, they can
not but feel that they are paying a
big price for the privilege of such re
joicing. Presbyterian Church.

Sheriff Kennerly performed a live
ly stunt on Tuesday, when with Depu
ties Howell and Minton, and Chief of
Police Livingston, he captured three
of those "smooth guy confidence men
who blow into Florida from the north
every winter, following the crowd.
The men arrested gave their names
as H. Raymond Stout of Kentucky,
Fred Wilson of Michigan, and Har
vey Hartwell of Pennsylvania.
The trio reached Palatka on Mon
day, and soon after met one J. D.
Blocker of Green Cove Springs, who
was not adverse to making a htu
"easy money" on the side.
The tirst man to meet tsiocKer was
the nice young man from Michigan,
who passed- himself off as a son of
the proprietor of the Putnam House.
While walking about the streets they
met quite accidentally, the actor of
the trio, who posed as a simple
minded "Dutchman," a friend of this
alleged son of the Putnam House own
er.
The "Dutchman," who was desig
nated by his co-conspirator, as a simple-minded
party, soon had the man
from Green Cove matching coins, in
which game the Green Cove man wun
$2.50. The "Dutchman" wasn't sat
isfied he still wanted to gamoie, ana
here the man from Michigan, who
rinsed as the "son." auietlv informed
the Green Cove man that the "Dutch
man" had $1,250, and that if he, (the
man from Green (Jove could raise
$1,000 he could guarantee that they
could pluck the "Dutchman" of his
wad. It was an easy way to get tne
money, and if they didn't get it some
one else would.
Rlocker was out for easy money,
but he didn't have the necessary $1,
000 with him; he could get it in his
home town. , .
Thev made some kind ot a bet.
The "Dutchman" was to wait until
Blocker could go to Green Love
Springs and get his money. As an
evidence of good faith the "Dutch
man" handed a package to tne son oi
the Putnam House owner, who was
to place it in the Hotel sate until tne
return of tne ureen uove man.
tWn wnlked to the Putnam House,
and as they were going up the steps
ii nt- "nnito neeirlenr.allv" the
proprietor and father coming out.
The matter was explained to him.
He was to put the "Dutchman's
money in the safe and hold until the
return of iilocKer wno was iu tuvci n-.
Mr. Blocker lett immediately
Green Cove Springs. There as he
was about to draw his money from
the bank, he told the cashier of his
"cinch." The cashier advised him to
beware; that he had better see the
sheriff. He saw that official and
then over the telepnone oneriii
King of Green Cove advised with
Sheriff Kennerly, with the result that
Blocker returned to Palatka and ap
peared to be carrying out his plan
with the men. A counterfeit pack
age was placed in the express office
at Green Cove addressed to Blocker,
and as Blocker and the "son" of the
Putnam House owner came irom me
local office with it they were met by
Sheriff Kennerly and his lieutenants,
who placed the alleged son of the
Putnam House owner under arrest.
The other members of the gang
were waiting up on Reid street, and
when they saw their partner in the
clutches of the sheriff, they skidded.
toward the Sauiers mill and
under threats of death compelled a
negro with a boat to pull tnem across
the river. The sheriff had a hct
chase and when he arrived at the
river front the men were some dis
tance out. He called on them to
come back, but they declined. Then
Sheriff Kennerly secured a launch and
went after thein, caught them and
brought them to the city.
Thp m ntu re was made about noon.

House owner" was an innocent par
ty," he didn't appear to know the
others, not till after he was safe in
jail. At the hearing the "Dutch
man" of the party, who played the
simple-minded one of the party, show
ed the greatest ability. He asked for
a postponement of the hearing on the
ground tnat tney were lar huui,
without money or friends, or a law
yer. The request was granted, and
the examination was postponed to
Tuesday morning of next week at 10
a. m., and the men placed under bonds
in sum of $500 each.
Without doubt Sheriff Kennerly has
caught three of the smoothest swin
dlers and confidence men in Florida,
a number of whom have been opera
ting in the state all winter.
Blocker was not caught, but that
is not his fault; he would have been
had he not unbosomed himself to the
cashier of his bank. He is not much
better than the men who attempted lo

to secure the "Dutchman's" money,

foul.

L. C. STEPHENS,
628 Kirby Street.
Nearly 100 of Palatka's business
men and members of the board of
trade banqueted at Bob James' Cafe
on Wednesday night at what has been
termned a "Booster-Roast," banquet,
or Get-together meeting.
It 'was about 8:30 when the crowd
filed into the cafe and were assigned
seats at tables clean and spotless and
decorated with beautiful roses and
other cut flowers. Bob James is a
booster, himself, and his heart was
in the work of catering to the comfort
of his guests. Rev. P. Q. Cason gave
the invocation.
A long center table was in the mid
dle of the dinning room, at the head
of which sat the toast-master, Judge
Julian C. Calhoun. Back of this was
another long table at which sat the
gentlemen who had organized a' bur
lesque on the city council, and who,
early in the program occupied an hour
in attending to city business. R. L.
Earnest acted as president of the
council, with the other members rep
resented by Warner T. Hamm, Fred
Merrill, R. E. L. Mann, Morris Coch
rane, II. P. Nerwich, Mercer Davis,
Chas. Burt, W. P. Dineen and John Q.
Tilghman. Messrs. Burt and Davis
represented the "gem'men from de
sixt wad," Davis impersonating "S'pot
de mo'shun" Adams, and Burt repre
senting Elder Robinson. These im
peronations were clever. Secretary
Elliott acted as clerk of the board and
read several ludicrous ordinances.
This over, the toastmaster called
for short talks by a number of those
present, leading off with Col. Jas.
R. MurphyJ president of the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc., and Hon. Jas.
R. Mellon of Pittsburg and Palatka,
who made excellent talks tending tJ
show the city's weaknesses and to
point the remedy, which was united
action a getting together in harmonious-
action for the welfare of the
city."
These gentlemen were followed by
Messrs. S. A. Parshley of Carthage,
Mo., a winter visitor, L. Cantrell, our
new county agricultural demonstrator,
W. A. Russell, Henry S. McKenzie,
Senator W. S. Wells of Tallahassee,
Hon.' A. J. Angle of Tampa, candidate
for State Comptroller, Mr. Monson of
New lork and Mayor W. P. Mernani.
The theme of all the speakers was:
"Wha's matter with Palatka?" and all
seemed to agree that a daily dose of
"Get-To-gether Bitters" and frequent
doses of "Push Powders" would prove
a sure cure for our "sleeping sick
ness." Just before the meeting closed Man
ager Louis Kalbfield suggested the
adoption of a slogan for the city -to
inscribe on the banner of every citi
zen "Push Progresive Palatka." It
was adopted with a whoop-pee.
Judge Calhoun as toastmaster made
many valuable suggestions and hail
opportunity to say many words which
are in the minds of the younger busi
ness and professional men of the city,
who predominated at the gathering,
and who are going to do the bulk of
the real "pushing" from this time or.
or until they, too, go into the dis
card like many of us old moss-backs
of the present day.

Mr. Woollcy's Lecture.
John G. Woolley, LL. D., the noted
prohibition orator and statesman, de
livered an interesting address at the
Baptist church last Monday night,
though strange to say, the attendance,
while good, was not as large as was
confidently expected.
Hon. S. J. Hilburn introduced the
speaker in a pleasing way.
Mr. Woolley spoke for more than
an hour, and every moment of tho
time was filled with interest. 1':
speech was in the interest of the pro
hibition amendment to the Constitu
tion of the United States, and abound
ed in witticisms spoken in a droll,
humorous vein that provoked enthusi
astic applause and laughter. Mr.
Wnollev spoke in a low voice, which
he afterward explained he did pur
posely because of the smallness of the
room. For this reason many in the
audience failed to catch every point
made. At times he rose to heights
of impressive eloquence seldom heard
in public speakers, and his peroration
was particularly eloquent and clothed
in the choicest diction. One of his
most impressive sentences was the
following, the manner of expression
lending much to the impressiveness of
the speaker's words:
"For every reason that churches
are built, the liquor traffic ought to
die; for every reason that schools are
maintained, the liquor traffic ought to
die: for every reason that the lioys
and girls ought to be given a show
for a clean life, the liquor traffic
ought to die; for every reason that
labor ought to be sriven a better
chance, the liquor traffic ought to die;
for every reason that houses of pros
titution ought to be impossible, tne
liquor traffic ought to die: for every
reason that the youth of the country
should be brought up to respect and
obey the law, the liquor traffic ought
to die; for every reason that politics
should be purified, the liquor traffic
ought to die and it is going to die
if the Christian men will do their
duty."

Macon. Savannah and other cities.
A fire in Nashville, Tenn., also late

He was well receiveu wiu
Gen. Funstcn on Wednesday re
ceived from Gen. f'ershing tha first
report from the ficnt in sixty nours
It came from Casas Grandes, and tho
only reference made to the operations
of Villa was that Villista and Carran
za trops had been engaged Monday
near Namaquipa.
Reports that Gen. Luis Herrera,
commanding 2,000 men at Chihuahua,
had aligned himself with Francisco
Villa against the United States, were
received that night with grave con
cern by Gen. Funston and his staff.
Officially and unofficially, the opin
ion at the Funston headquarters was
that with Herrera joining, forces with
Villa, the international siuation might
easily be made so complex that by
comparison the pursuit of Villa would
be regarded as incidental.
In Washington it is thought the re
bellion in Carranza's army would ren
der the position of the American ex
peditionary force so perilous that ev
ery available soldier would be rushed
to reinforce the advancing columns.
For the purpose not more than about
15,000 men would be available with
out calling out the National Guard.
There are now on the border or in
Mexico in the neighborhood of 25,
000 soldiers, and in the whole of the
continental forces number only a lit
tle more than 5,000.
All reports from the border were
sent to the White House last night and
were the subiect of a long conference
between President Wilson and Secre
tary Baker. Afterward Mr. Baker
declined to talk.
Now, Help in This.
The Palatka public school wants a
Victrola, and the children are plan
ning to get it.
As one of them said to The News,
"Please tell the people to begin to
save their money for the 'Stunt
Night' and help the Palatka public
school to get a Victrola. We will
promise a good night's fun for only
25 cents. Each grade will furnish
one short 'stunt.' We have long
wanted and felt the need of a Victrola,
so to do so we want the people to
come out, enjoy a pleasant evening
and help their school to this extent.
The date of the entertainment will be
advertised later.
Jack Becks Makes a "Kick."
To the Public:
It has come to me through reliable
parties that certain people in this dis
trict are trying to injure me political
ly and in a business way by circu
lating false and malicious reports.
They have been telling on the streets
that I had charge, or supervised the
work of building the Putnam county
Court House, and are pointing to the
vretehed work on that building and
its deplorable condition as some of my
work. These men know, or ought to
';now, that 1 had nothing whatever to
o with the building of the court
house, nnd thut I have never received
i renny from the construction of that
: uilding, in any shape or form. It is
'ndeed strange that when a man
comes up for office that some one has
lo go and manufacture untruths con
leming him. Such men are too low
to -lotice. thoueh I am constrained to
notice this malicious report because
of the many who are here now who
were not here when the court house
was built, and who, therefore, might
be influenced against me.
