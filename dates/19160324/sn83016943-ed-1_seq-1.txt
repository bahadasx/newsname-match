Cunningham For Congress.
In this issue will be found the
announcement of Hon. James A.
Cunningham, of Prentiss County,
as a candidate for Congress from
the First Congressional District
of Mississippi.
While his candidacy was an
nounced only a few days ago, it
is already an assured fact that
he has behind him practically a
unanimity of support from all
the business and political fac
tions and the people generally of
this section.
This remarkable following is
not based so much upon the idea
of home Dride as upon the gen
eral recognition of his splendid
personal traits, his Christian
character, his unquestionable
ability to do things and his devo
tion to the best interests of the
masses of DeoDle.
We venture the assertion that
no citizen of this state, his en
vironments beinjr considered,
has succeeded in doing and ac
complishing more in life's prog
ress than can be justly credited
to Mr. Cunningham.
At the age of 14 years, an il
literate boy, living sixteen miles
back in the country, with a fam
ily dependent upon him for sup-
Kort. a share-cropper and hired
and. without means or assist
ance he began his career for bet
ter things. He was willing to
dIow the other man's mule, till
the other man's soil and work at
the other man's price, but when
he undertook a thing he did it
well and his services always
proved worth the price. At the
age of 19, through dilligence and
determination, he first entered

the public schools, where his
record as a student, in the cabin
school house by day and beside a
pine-knot fire at night, brought
not only phenominal advance
ment in his studies, but also
gave promise to the greater suc
cesses to be attained. This rec
ord he maintained both as a stu
dent and a teacher in college,
where his work gave further in
dex of real worth.
In 1903 he was elected to the
Lower House of Representatives
from this county by an over
whelming majority in the first
primary over several prominent
men. He gained distinction in
that body. Afterward, in 1907,
he was elected to the State Sen-
ate, ana is one oi the lew men
ever sent to the Legislature from
this country who actually framed
and put through the Senate every
i i m . i m
measure he stood for on the cam
paign. He entered the practice of law
in Booneville, Miss., in 190G,
without means, without exper
ience as a lawyer and with a li
brary consisting of some half
dozen books, but he
entered this
profession as he had always en
tered other fields of endeavor
he entered to success. As a law
yer his progress has been unpre
cedented, and no man at the
bar either local or surrounding,
will doubt that he is one of the
most accomplished scholars in
the law, one of the ablest advo
cates, and that he ha3 to his
credit one of the most enviable
practices of any lawyer in this
part of the state.
He is one of the few men who
grow strong under the pressure ;
of a crucial moment, and because
of this trait he has developed an
ability tor debating questions
that will give him a place in
Congress at an early date that
few men have the ability to acquire.

Jim Cunningham is a born
fighter not a fighter of men,
but a fighter for principles. He
never took an unfair advantage
of an adversary nor surrendered
a conviction of his own. Often
men have agreed with him, often
they have honestly differed with
him, but they have always re
spected him and honored him be
cause of his earnest devotion to
principles and his bold and able
efforts in support of every cause
he has espoused. The Banner
predicts for this young man a
great career and we believe the
future is restlessly waiting for
his coming, and will feel his force
and influence in the halls of Con
gress. Boonjyille Banner.
