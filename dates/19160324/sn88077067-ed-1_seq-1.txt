Leo Schunck yesterday shipped
five blood hound pups from his fa
mous kennels to Carl Moore, sheriff
of Cloud County, Concordia, Kansas.
Cloud county is one of tho most wild
and wooly counties of Kansas and
Sheriff Moore has claimed quite a
reputation through hte work of his
blood hounds.
His purchase of five pups from the
Schunck kennels speaks well for the
local dog fancier. Leo still owns the
older dogs-and intends keeping them
for use in this section.
BETZEL WILL KEEI THEM
ALIVE
It is not going to be denied there is
something lacking with Huggins out
of the game, and his retirement is to
be regretted, but he is going to have
a mighty nifty little successor in Bru
no Betzel at second base. This
youngster, reckoned by his showing
last year, is going to develop Into a
great ball player, adn going to de
velop fast, too. And he's no Silent
Smith, either. Last year was his first
out and he was becomingly modest,
but he's an honest-to-goodness regu
lar on the job now. Watch him and
if he isn't found stepping on some
body's toes before the season is a
month old, then his close acquain
tances are bad judges of charcater.
Sporting News, St. Louis, Mo.
Betiel is in line for a permanent
berth at second this season. Last
season Betzel played- 105 games at
third base. Most of his work there
was due to the injury which kept
Beck on the bench the greater part
of the season. Third is not a natural
position for Betzel, while he does fit
in at second. Bruno has been worked
at second since he Joined the train
ing camp and Is going in fine style.
Huggins wants to retire to the bench
and Betzel is assured of being given
every chance to make good at second.
He is fast and clever In the field, and
gets around the bases with speed, but
his hitting last season was weak. Hla
batting figure In the official averages
Is .251. Betzel is young and can im
prove in both batting and fielding.
With Betiel at second the remaind
er of the infield line-up will be Miller
at first, Corhan at short and Beck at
third. This means two men in new
positions on the infield out of four
and the working of the combination
will be watched with much Interest.

DAK1LS GUEEN ANU HIS I'LYIXG
MACHINE
When John T. Trowbridge wrote
"Darius Green and His Flying Mach-
no" forty-live years ago he believed
that man would never fly; and the
dream that he would live to see men
My never came to him. And yet, up
on the very day that Trowbridge died
;i few weeks since, the I'ostoillce De
partment of the government issued a
call for bids for the establishment of
an aeriel mail service route in Alas
ka. So fast are we traveling.
Trowbridge's poem convulsed the
world with laughter, for in almost ev
ery community there was a Darius
Green; some fellow who was puzi
ling over a perpetual motion machine
or a flying machine; some man who,
because he lived aloof and dreamed
drepnis, was thought,by his practical
neighbors to be teched In the head.
Trowbridge s poem was a "take-off
of that sort of a boy.
'An aspiring genius was D. Green;
The sou of a farmer, ago fourteen;
His body was long and lank and lean;
Just right for flying, as will be seen;
He had two eyes as bright as a bean,
And a freckeled nose that grew be
tween.
little awry for I must mention
That he had riveted his attention
Upon his wonderful invention,
Twisting his tongue as he twlsteed
the strings.
And working his face as he worked
the wings,
nd with every turn of gimlet and
screw
Turning and screwing his mouth
round, too.
Nobody but a fool would ever
dream of flying, and how the audien
ces used to laugh when the person
reciting the piece came to the rea
sons Darius gave for his dream:
The birds can fly, an why can t I?
Must we give in," says he with a grin,
That the bluebird an' phoebe
Are smarter'n we be?
Jest fold our hands an' see the swal-
ler
An' blackbird an' catbird beat us hol
ler?
Does the little chatterln', sassy wren.
No bigger'n my thumb, know more
than men?
Jes show me that!
Ur prove 't the bat
Hez got more brains than's In my
hat
An' I'll back down, an' not till then!"
He argued further: "Nur I can't see
What's the use o' wings to a bumble
bee,
ur to git a livin' with, more n to me;
Ain't my business
Important as his'n is?"
Trowbridge lived to see many Dar
ns Greens circling above his home
near Boston and to read of the fleets
of aeroplanes and Zeppelins in tne
great war.
He was 88 years old when he died,
few weeks ago. He had seen the de
velopment of electricity from a play
thing to a force of wide use; the in
vention of the telephone, wireless
telegraphy, motion pictures the ocean
teamship, the railway train, the sub
marine, the motor car. When he was
a boy petroleum was unknown. In
his lifetime gasoline and all the by
products of crude oil and coal tar
were invented and came Into use. He
aid, shortly beforo his death, that
the most wondreful invention of his
age was the flying machine; and that
it was destined to work more of a re
volution than any other.
Who among us could be bold and
Imaginative enough to even dream of
the wonders that will come to pass
in a' lifetime of the infant of today
who will live to be 88 years old!

GREAT
Bene ft to Seattle, Morally and
Economically,
Saya Editor of Tlme,Who Fought
Dry to End-Admits Error
and Glad He Wai Licked.
I''
oin the Kansas City Star, Feb
9.
1016.
The world is watching Seattle to
o how prohibition works out In a
largo city. Seattle is the largest city
that has ever had prohibition. It
and the whole state of Washington
became dry January 1 of this year.
Tho strongest single force that
worked against prohibition In the
stato of Washington was the limes,
the leading newspaper of Seattle. In
its campaign against the passage of
the prohibtory law it used all the fa
miliar old arguments such as "i'rohl
bition doesn't prohibit," that it
would force down rents, that so much
property used for saloons all at once
made empty and nonproductive in one
day would have a had economic ef
fect, and so on.
Why Ho Fought 1'roblbillon
The editor of the Seattle Times,
Maj. C. B. Blethon, the man who
made the light against prohibition,
was at the Coates yesterday. He was
asked how prohibition was working
itid if all his prophecias had come
true. He said:
"My paper fought its damnedest
against prohibition. We fought it
on economic grounds alone. We be
lieved that in a great seaport city
w ith a population of upwards of 300,
000 prohibition would be destructive;
it would bring on economic disaster.
We believed that under our system
of licensing saloons e had the liquor
traflic about as well controlled as it
could be and we wanted to let It alone
and so we fought as hard as we could
fight. But, in spite of all we could
do against it .prohibition carried and
t went into efiect In Washington on
January 1. We have had a month
of it now."
"And how has it worked out?
Business h'xpanded Quickly
"We already know that it is a
great benefit, morally and from an
economic standpoint. Its moral ben-
fit has been tremendous. Seattle
had 260 saloons and we had an aver
age of 2,600 arrests a month for
crimes and misdemeanors growing
out of liquor drinking. In January
we had only four hundred arrests
and sixty of those were made January
1 and were the results of hang overs
rom the old year. That In itself is
enough to convince any man with a
conscience that prohibition is ncees
sary. There can be no true economy
n anything that is immoral.
'And on top of that great moral
result, we have these economic facts:
n the first three weeks of January
the savings deposits in the banks of
Seattle increased 15 per cent. There
was not a grocery store In Seattle
that did not show an Increase of bus
iness in January greater than ever
known in any month before in all
the history of the city, except In hol
iday time. In all the large grocery
stores the increase was immense. In
addition to this every dry goods store
in Seattle, except one, and that one I
have no figures from, had a wonder
ful increase in business. Each store
reported the largest business ever
done in one month, except in holiday
time.
The Women and Chidlren Prollt
'"I wished to know in what class of
goods the sales increased so greatly,
and so I sent to all the grocery and
dry goods stores to find that out.
And to me it is a pitiful thing, and
it makes me sorry that we did not
have prohibition long ago that the
increase in sales In ail the dry goods
stores was in wearing apparel of wo
men and children, and in the grocery
stores, increase was made up chief
ly of fruits and fancy groceries. This
proves that it is the women and child
ren who benefit greatest from prohib
ition. Money that went formerly ov
er the bar for whisky is now being
spent for clothing for the women and
children, and in better food for the
household.
"It is just like this: When you
close the saloons the money that for
merly was spent there remains In the
family of the wage earner, and his
wife and children buy shoes, cloth
ing and better food with it. Yes sir,
we have found in Seattle that it is
better to buy shoes than booze. The
families of wage earners in Seattle
are going to have more food and
more clothes and everything else than
they had before."
It Actually I'rohibits
"And is the prohibiiton law enforc
ed?" "Absolutely. Prohibition does
prohibit."
"And how about the empty saloons
and the landlords who own them?"
"Many of them have already been
made over and are occupied by other
businesses. I will venture the pro
phecy that in one year from today
you won't be able to find In Seattle
where there was a saloon. They will
all be occupied by other businesses.
And prohibition has not lowered
rents. I know of one big dry goods
store that has already had its rent
raised since prohibition went into ef
fect. Coast States All Will be Dry
"Oregon also went dry January 1.
California is the only wet state left
on the Tacific coast, and it will go
dry January 1, 1918. And those
three states will remain dry to the
end of time. None of them would
ever have saloons again. Those who
were honestly opposed, as I was, to
prohibition in Washington and Ore
gon, have been converted to it, as I
have been, by the actual evidence
that prohibition is a fine thing from
a business standpoint. No city and
no community can afford to
have saloons. They are too expen
sive, morally and economically. In
a very few years there will not be a
licensed saloon in the whole nation
and that will be a fine thing."
WASHINGTON'S I'ATItlOTISM
"Observe good faith and Justice to
wards all nations; cultivate poace
and harmony with all. Religion and
morality enjoin this conduct, and can
it bo that good policy does not equal
ly enjoin it? It will be worthy of a
free, enlightened, and, at no distant
period, a great nation, to give to man
kind tho iiiagnoiiliiious and too novel
example of a people always guided
by an exalted Justice and benevo
lence. Who can doubt but, In the
course of time and things, the fruits
of such a plan would richly repay
any temporary advantages which
might bo lost by & steady adherence
to it." Washington's Farewell Ad
dress.
