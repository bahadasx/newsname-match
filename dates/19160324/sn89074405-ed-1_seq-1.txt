Paris, March
24.—The
following of­
ficial statement was issued by the war
office tonight
"To the north of the Aisne we di
rected destructive fires on the German

and the railways of the eastern Ar
gonne and on the Malancourt wood.
"To the west of the Meuse the
bombardment persisted In the region
of "Malancourt and against our front
in Bethincourt, Le Mort Homme and
Cumieres.
"To the east of the Meuse and in
the Woevre the artillery action devel
oped a certain intensity. There was
no infantry action during the course
of the day.
"In the Vosges we bombarded the
enemy cantonments In the environs of
Muhlbach."
The Belgian official communication
reads:
"On the greater extent of the Bel
gian front the activity of the artillery
on both sides was normal. To t,bt
north of Steensstraete,' however,' the
artillery duel .was of unusual violence.
Uuring the course of the day of March
23 we everywhere effectively counter
shelled the enemy batteries.
No Change.

no changes in the situation around

Gentians Progresslnff.
Berlin, March 24.—Further suc
cesses have been won by the Ger
mans in the vicinity of Baucourt and
Haucourt, northwest of Verdun, the
army headquarters announced, and
two additional trenches were captur
ed. On the Russian front, the various
attacks on the German lines in the
northern sector have been continued,
both northwest and south of Dvinsk.
All assaults broke down, the state
ment declares.
Field Marshal von Hindenberg's
march is less marked. The Russians
are said to have sustained' very heavy
Interest In West.
Berlin, March 24.—The Importance
of the struggle around Verdun na
urally overshadows interest in the
contest on the eastern front, but the
latest dispatches shows that hard
fighting is in progress in the northern
sector of the Russian line. The Rus
sian gun fire became Intense on the
evening of March 19. More than 60,
000 shells, chiefly of heavy caliber,
fell over a small section of the front
near Postavy.
Trendies Damaged.
German wire entanglements and
front line trenches were damaged by
tiie lire. At night the Russians at
tacked in thick waves. The first two
waves were mowed down before they
reached the entanglements. The third
attack pierced the German positions
on the front of less than 100 yards,
and the assailants were ejected by a
counter-attack led In person by regi
mental commander.
Another Attack.
At dawn the Russians made another
attack, but it was smothered in the
initial stages by German artillery.
Four Russian divisions are said to
have participated In these movements.
The Germans-were compelled to sum
mon a few reserves. Their losses were
heavier than on the two preceding
days of fighting on account of Russian
gun fire, but it is asserted nevertheless
that they were surprisingly small. The
activity of the Russians at other points
of Field Marshal von Hindenburg's
march are less marked. The Russians
are said to have sustained very heavy
losses.
RECEPTION IS MIXED.
Abandonment of Monarchy Has Great
Effect
Shanghai, China, March 24.—Ad
vices from Hong Kong yesterday In
dicate that the state department man
date announcing abandonment of the
plan to resume the monarchlal form
of government in China has met with
a mixed reception in South China.
Of the two equally strong and force
ful factions there, the supporters of
Yuan Shi Kal, are said to believe
there will be a peaceful settlement of
the existing difficulties as a result of
the decision reached. Those opposed
to Tuan Shi Kal, according to the ad
vices. declare the mandate has come
too late and that people are too deep
ly stirred against what they charac
terise as Tuan Shi Kal's faithlessness
to his presidential oath to be appeased
with anything less than his elimina
tion as head of the government.

London, March 24.—The war office
last night made public the following
official communication:
"A further report has been received
from Egypt regarding the liberation
of 91 prisoners who were in the hands
of the Senussl tribesmen. The rescue
expedition, which was entirely separ
ate from the action of March 14
(when the British captured Solium)
took place March 17.
"Nine armored ears, 26 other cars,
and 10 motor ambulances left Solium
at 3 o'clock in the morning, guided by
Captain Royle and two natives. The
prisoners were said to be at Blr
Hakim, 70 miles from Solium, but the
actual distance traveled was about 121
miles.
"At the approach of the cars, the
guards fled, but they were pursued
and killed. All the cars returned
safely, bringing back the prisoners,
who are being cared for in the hospi
tal. Their condition is reported as
satisfactory.' Only two. prisoners re
main in the hands of the enemy, and
there is some hope that they may be
rescued."

reported that ah armored, car section
under the command of the Duke of
Westminster had rescued, 26 miles
west of Solium, 90 shipwrecked sailors

But Bruegger Supporters
ClainjtwHis Election is
N6w Certain.
PERRY LEADING.
Re*orns received late today
give Peny.4£64 and .Bruegger
4,203. Only a few precincts still
remain to be heard from accord
ing to tbeni figures.
AdditionaL'^returns from various
North Dakota counties, several of
which repotted complete figures,
made very little change in the race
between H. 'H. Perry of Ellendale and
John Bruegger of Williston for Dem
ocratic national committeeman. To
day's return's Increased Perry's lead
from 130 to 197. They give Perry
3,647 votes and Bruegger 3,449, while
William Ol$on is given 1,407.
LaFolIette's lead remains propor
tionately the same, while Gunder Ol
son maintains an overwhelming ad
vantage over' Lemke.
Bruegger supporters today claimed
that their candidate has taken a lead
oyer Perry and that he will win by a
safe margin. Perry headquarters last
night maintained that the Ellendale
man would win by a plurality of at
least 400.
Several of the strong Bruegger
counties have not been heard from,
however, and while the Democratic
vote undoubtedly will be small, it will
make a great• difference in the Brueg
ger-Perry battle.

VILLA SURROUNDED BY
TROOPS Of
San Antonio, Tex., March 24.—Re
ports from Mexican sources that Villa
is surrounded at El Oso, five miles
south of Namlquipa by American and
Carranza troops, and that the Villa
forces are defeated, are accepted by
General Funston as probably true, al
though no confirmation by General
Pershing has been received.
The improvement in working of the
wireless made It appear possible that
Pershing would break his fifth day of
silence regarding the operations south
of Casas Grandes by rendering an ac
count of the engagement at El Oso.
If reports coming from Casas Grandes
are true, the chances for capturing
Villa or running him to a point where
he must make his last fight are great
ly increased.
Location Campaign.
Until now operations against Villa
have been nothing more than a cam
paign of location. Three cavalry de
tachments have been working south
ward along widely separated trails,
but an opportunity of direct chase is
now offered, it is indicated by staff
officers who have followed details of
the pursuit. Here, it was not be
lieved that the Americans would al
low Villa to get out of their sight
again, and that his capture or death
appeared more likely than at any
other time.
General Pershing, it was believed,
would concentrate as many of his men
as possible in a pursuing force, re
lieving those who have been riding

EPtUPSYGERM
IS DISCOVERED
Exists in Soil and Enters the
Body Through the
Stomach.
St. Joseph, Mo., March 24.—The
discovery of a germ which he asserted
caused epilepsy was announced by Dr.
Charles A. L. Reed of Cincinnati in an
address before the semi-annual meet
ing of the Medical Society of the Mis
souri Valley. The germ was called
the bacillus epilepticus, and the
speaker asserted that, like the germ
of lockjaw, it probably exists in the
soil and enters the body through the
stomach and Intestines, where it con
tinues to live. Dr. Reed contended
that clogging of the alimentary canal,
always present in epileptic cases, forc
ed the germ from the intestines into
the blood, where it was also self-per
petuating.
"When this germ- is taken from the
blood of epileptics and injected into
the veins of rabbits," said the speak
er, "it causes them to have epilesy,
generally in fatal form.
Rabbits fed on food contaminated
with the germ develop epilepsy. One
rabbit developed epilepsy from which
it died as the result of licking blood
containing the germ from the ear of
another rabbit."
Dr. Reed said there was abundant
evidence tending to show that the
disease often has been communicated
from one person to another.
"This discovery of the real cause
and nature of epilepsy," said Dr.
Reed, "points not only to cure but to
preventln. While It brings a brighter
day to the heretofore hopeless epilep
tic, it ought shortly to relieve the state
of much of a heavy and rapidly grow
ing burden."

Mules Only Transport.
Columbus. N. M., March 24.—The
American campaign to capture Villa
has reached a point in the foothills
of Chihuahua, where it has been
found necessary to dispense with
heavy motor trucks as transport
facilities, and to depend entirely upon
the army pack mule, it was learned
here today.
It is known that the trucks encoun
tered many difficulties In the sandy
region through which troops have
passed. Motor trains will probably
be used, however, for transport pur
poses between Columbus and the ad
vanced base at Casas Grandes.
Troops Closing In.
Douglas, Ariz., March 24.—General
P. Ellas Calles, military governor of
Sonora, today received a telegram
from General Enriquez, military gov
ernor or Chihuahua, stating that five
columns of Carranza troops were
closing In on Villa and his bandits
near Namlquipa. and that, with the
aid of the Americans, it was believed
that Villa would not be able to escape.
Reports False.
Governor Enriquez also telegraphed
that reports concerning the revolt of
General Herrera were false, and were
circulated in an effort by the "radi
cals" to cause trouble between the
Carranza government and the United
States.

Adventure* of British Party
in Anarctic Not Made
Public.
THREE OBJECTS

SAFE OR STRANDED.
London, March 24.—A cable
gram from Sidney, Australia, says
that the steamship Aurora of Sir
Ernest Shackelton's expedition
has broken from her moorings at
Ross Sea base, leaving most of
the party ashore, unable to em
bark. According to these advices
Lieut. Shaokelton and his com
panions will be compelled to re

be possible to rescue them.
Sydney, New South Wales, March
24.—Lieutenant Sir Ernest H. Shack
leton has returned from his Antarctic
expedition. News of the achieve
ments of the expedition is withheld
for the present.
Three Purposes.
The adventure of Shackleton, head
ing the British trans-Antarctic expedi
tion had a three-fold purpose, name
ly, to navigate Antarctic on the Meri
dian: to secure for the British flag
the honor of being the flrst national
emblem thus to be taken from sea
to sea across this South Polar realm,
and to conduct scientific work relating,
among other phases to meterology,
geography, geology and the geodetic
survey.
Large Sum Raised.
The expedition was linanced for the
most part by large gifts from persons
Interested in polar exploration. Funds
amounting to more than $300,000 were
raised, including $50,000 from the
British government.
The expedition left England in two
sections about six weeks after the
European war began in 1914.

Declares report of Herrera's
Disloyalty Without
Foundation.
MEXICANS ACTIVE
ALONG THE BORDER
General Situation Regarded
as More Encouraging at
Washington.
Washington, March 24.—The ques
tion of calling out the national guard
for border duty to release the regulars
for service in Mexico was discussed at
a cabinet meeting today, but it was
decided there were no prospects of
such action at this time.
Herrara Loyal.
American Consul Letcher at Chi
chuahua has reported that there is no
truth in the reported revolt of General
Luis Herrera, and his Garranza gar
rison at Chihuahua. Although Gen
eral Funston and General Bell, on the
border have received reports con
firming the story of the revolt, the
dispatch from Consul Letcher, who is
on the ground, and has headquarters
at the place where the revolt is said
to have occurred, is taken by officials
here as confirming the statements of
Carranza officials that no such revolt
has occurred.
Letcher's dispatch reported that
Herrera. who is in command of the
Carranza troops there, "was loyal to
General Carranza." His report is re
garded as removing one of the most
menacing features of the Mexican
situation.
Wire from FuMion.
Funston has sent this telegram to
the war department:
"General Herrera in a telegram to
General Gavlra strongly denied all re
ports that he had gone over to Villa.
General Gutierrez, governor of Chi
huahua, in a letter to General Gavira,
also strongly denies that General Her
rera has gone over to Villa."
Reports Conflict.
Conflicting reports of massing of
Carranza troops on the border con
tinued to reach here today. Ameri
can consuls in northern Mexico said
they found no massing of troops in
the northern sections. Senator Ash
hurt of Arizano, however, received
from D. A. Richardson of Douglas, a
telegram saying that a Mexican gen
eral with 3,000 cavalry and 40 pieces
of artillery had arrived at a point over
the border not more than ten blocks
from the center of Douglas, and that
7,000 additional Carrara cavalry
were six miles south of the border.
Richardson telegraphed that the
American troops near Douglas were
Inadequate, and that there was fear
of an attack. Senator Ashhurst said
he knew Richardson and regarded
his information as authoritative.

Operate on Front of About
70 Miles—Russians Use
Favorite Fighting.
Petrograd, March 24.—While ad
mitting that it is not yet clear wheth
er the fighting which is in progress
south of Dvinsk signifies a general ad
vance of the Russian troops in that
section, or whether it is intended as
a demonstration to attract German
forces from the Franco-German front,
the military critics lay emphasis upon
what they allude to as the universal
success of the attacks during the last
few days, the viciousness of which Is
pointed to as being sufficient to have
made an impression upon the German
general staff.
The Russian troops are operating in
three groups, covering a front of 70
miles, but the severest fighting is re
ported to have occurred in the vicinity
of Lake Narocz, where the Russian
drive carried them through three linea
of German trenches heavily protected
by wire entanglements. The Russians
resorted to their favorite method, bay
onet fighting, routing the Germans in
spite of desperate resistance and cap
turing more than 1,000 men. Including
17 officers, a doten machine guns and
other booty.
The Germans are invariably coun
tering the Russian attacks by advanc
ing at other sections of the. line, but
from all appearances, according to
the military observers, the Teutonic
efforts lack co-ordination and it la ev
ident that in spite of the recent con
centration of additional troops in this
region, the Russians anticipated any
plans their adversaries may hawtaA
for a concerted offensive here.
The German strength -was estimated
last autumn to be eight corps Of In
fantry and several cavalry dlvUtObS In
this region, but these have
considerably augmented.
