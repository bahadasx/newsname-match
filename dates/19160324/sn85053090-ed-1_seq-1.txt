Tex Taylor who was given a sen
tence of from one to three years
in the state pen for assault man
aged to make his escape last
week while detained in the jail
at Baker. Through outside help
he was able to secure an iron bar
which he used to remove several
bricks and make a hole in the
wall large enough for him to
crawl through. So far his where
abouts are unknown but the
county officers hope to have him
again in a short time. It seems
that with the building of the ne
court house at Baker that the
county dads would have invested
a little extra money in the con
structing of a suitable jail in con
nection, and thus adopt the
"safety-first" slogan in regard
to those prisoners who are placed
under the care of the sheriff's of
fice,
Bank In Good Condition
Attention is called to the state
ment of the condition of the Eka
laka State Bank, published else
where in this issue. To one who
has observed these statements
as published from time to time
during the last year it is a notice
able fact that the local institution
is making a steady growth both
as to the amount of business done
and as a re liable and safe bank
ing house.
The last statement shows the
total deposits to be $123,000.00
as against $81.000.00 last year,
while the available reserve is
shown to be at the unusually high
mark of 40 per cent of the de
posits.

Lack O f
The dance last Friday evening
given by the Fair & Racing Ass'n
was well attended despite the
fact that the dancers had to wait
until nearly 11:00 p.m. before
they were given the floor by the
G. O. P. boosters. The dance
did not break un until nearly 3;30
in the morning which gave those
that were forced to listen to the
convincing (?) arguments ample
time to shake down their systems
to normal condition before retir
ing.
Veli Chaus.se of near Boyes
was brought in last week and
lodged in the county jail await
ing a hearing before the district
court on the charge of grand lar
ceny. A few days before Thanks
giving last year the general store
at Boyes was broken into and
considerable cash taken. A bench
warrant was issued at that time
and through the cashing of cer
tain checks said to have been
taken with the currency Chausse
was apprehended and placed un
der arrest. His hearing will come
before the court at the April
term.
From a cliniatological map
of the state of Montana compiled
j from data furnished by the U. S.
Weather Bureau we learn that
Fallon County is the only county
as a whole within the borders of
the Treasure State that during
the nast year recorded a rainfall
of more than 20 inches. Parts of
other counties show this amount
but for a county as a whoie Fal
lon carries off all honors. As the
information is secured from such
a reliable source as the govern
ment weather bureau at Wash
ington there can be no kidnapp
ing of this one honor from our
own county,so let us add this one
feature to our honest truth in re
gard to Fallon County resources
j and opportunities.

Treating Grains
The time will soon be at hand
for seeding crops again, and this
naturally brings up the question
of seed treatment for smuts. It
has been demonstrated in many
states with numerous tests that
smut treatment pays every year.
During the past season the Cus
ter County agent made some in
vestigations on smut conditions
as found throughout the county.
Fields of grain were found that
had been seeded with untreated
grain that averaged from 5 to 40
percent smutted heads of grain.
It does not require much figuring
to see what the losses are in such
cases. In a few instances fields
were discovered that were prac
tically worth less to the owner
because of smut. Such exam
ples are costly experiences to the
grower but usually convince the
most skeptical, it pays to treat
seed grains.
Hasty methods probably cause
more loss and discouragement in
treating seeds than any factors.
Don't guess at the amount of
water used, measure it and then
apply carefully, being sure to wet
all the grain throughly.
The following are methods of
treating for oat smut.
1. Soak the seed with formalin
solution. The formalin may be
applied in any of the three ways.
(1) By putting the solution into
a t[ ^ ht barrel or vat and the sacks i
into it, moving them up andj4,
down fora few minutes to get !
out the air and wet all the grains, j
ere pound of formalin to J
1 55 gallons of water and keeping
1 the gram immersed
for 2 hours.
(2) By spreading out on a barn
!floor or wa £° n box, a sackful
at a time, sprinkling on the sol

utior. with a watering-pot, j
shoveling into a pile and mixing
j thoroughly to wet every grain,
i and covering with blankets for j
j two or four hours; and this latter
direction is very important as the i
gases given off will kill any
pores that may have escaped the ;
solution. Be sure to disinfect
bins, floors and sacks before
putting grain into it again. With
this method use one pound of
formalin to forty gallons of water.
2. Stinking smut of wheat,
give the same treatment as pre
scribed for oat smut.
3. Loose smut of wheat
formalin treatment wiil not pre
vent this disease as it attacks
the heads long after planting
time. Rotate for two or three
years with oats or some other
crop.
4. Barley smut (covered),
give the same treatment as pre
scribed for oats,
It will cost vou about two cents
per acre to treat your seed grain.
Can you aiford not to take ad
vantage of this cheap insurance?

For School Trustee
We have been informed that a
petition is to be filed asking the
ihcing of the name of Mrs. M;
A. McLean upon the election
ballot for this district. One
school trustee is to be elected at
the election April 1st, the term of
J. P. Hedges, who does not seek
re-election to have expired at
that time. That Mrs. McLean is
capable of looking after the inter
ests of those interested in this
district and will make a good
member on the school board is
well known, her residence of over
twenty-five years in Ekalaka
having proven her a woman of
unusual business ability and well
informed on the needs and man
agement of the public schools.
Two sisters of Mrs. M, A. Mc
Lean; Miss Mary Lee Wilson and
Mrs. Henry Smith, both of Miles
City served as county superin
tendents in our parent county,
Custer, where they established
for themselves great respect as
to their educational knowledge
and abilities. During her resi
dence in Ekalaka Mrs. McLean
has enrolled five children in the
public schools here, a fact thatj^
proves her sincere interest in the
welfare of our educational insti
tntions.

IComplete a Good Job
In a write-up referring to the
democratic administration of the
state under Samual V. Stewart
the Roundup Tribune says:—
And while the democrates are
about it they may just as well

S candidate for lieutenant
governor. There isn't a better
man for the position in the state
or one who woul d add more
strength to the ticket.
Wool Prices Boom
Wool growers upon the advent
of the democratic administration
were advised that their business
wou'd soon go "fluey" but the
; following account from Dillon
1 l°°ks to us as >f the sheepmen
are more prosperous than ever:
| "When J. R. Edgeheill pur
! chased the wool clip of the Sel
way Sheep Company, of Dillon,
for a trifle more than 31 cents
per pound he not only opened the
season by making the first pur
chase, but he paid the highest
price ever recorded in southern
Montana, if not in the entire
state.
"Mr. Edgeheiil, a representative
of the Hallowell. Jones & Donald
Company, of Boston, was the
heaviest purchaser operating in
that vicinity last year and paid
the highest price. He has pur
chased more than one-quarter of
a million pounds of Beaverhead
wool for a price which averages
more than 31 cents, and is rapid
dy closing up contracts with oth
1 er leading sheepmen.
"Wool and sheepmen in this
vicinity are more optimistic than
ever over the future of the wool
| industry in Montana this year,
since the season has opened un
der the most favorable of au
spices."
