The pot of rebellion Is beginning to

being abandoned. .
The policemen aren't going to get
the raises they expected. They have
learned, they say,- that: the adminis

cops and officers; too, went out for the
re-election of Mayor Wilson, and
worked hard iii the hope that their.
reward would "be raise3. I
Instead old political debts will be
(laid by the - administration. " Sixty
new policemen will be added : to the
(present force and, those in the .latter
will get the same pay they have been
getting.
T The 'cops say they've been double-
crossed. They say President John C.
Stanley of the police commissioners
reported to tne poncemens committee
that the tax board offered a 5 per cent.
Increase, and that it was refused be
cause it was too small. Stanley1 told
them, they say, that he had asked for
their increase, as they suggested
Si ground Loewith, a member of the
tax board and of the. sub-committee
that has charge of the police depart

never; asked for an increase for the
men. V The matter naturally would
come before Loewith, chairman of the

Through District Attorney- Thomas

against the Salt's Textile Co. of this
city, claiming violations of the Alien
Labor war. Twenty counts against
the eompanjF are included in the com
plaint and on each the penalty that
may be named is $1,000. ,
It is alleged that the Salt's Co. im
ported weavers and weaving shop
workers from France in 1914. and made
contracts with them.
The prosecution of the government
follows the announced determination
of John Golden, -president of the Unit
ed Textile Workers of North America,
who. was iji Bridgeport last summer,
to instlgatel Federal action.
During the summer of 1915 the em
ployes of the Salt's, factory went on
strike." A.fter, they -were out a month,
some returned and with them some
French weavers. The latter left soon
afterward, declaring that they had re
ceived serious cuts in their wages and
that they were obliged to operate un
der the two loom system whereas they
had been accustomed to the one loom.

"friendly" letter to his landlady, in
which "he spoke of goiny tothe board

on her property, after he had receiv
ed a notice, that his rent was to be
raised, appears to be couched in terms
not so' friendly as the good-natured
city lclerk's recent interview with The
Farmer would indicate.
Mr. Robinson took exception to the
account in The Farmer of his having
resorted to the municipal authorities
when he received notice pf his rent
increase. He disliked the view that

he might- have caused undue worri-

house in. which the city clerk has
dwelt for several years. It is published
herewith:
, :- February 1, 1916.
Mrs. A. Wallenta, . , " 1
3887 Noa-thMain Street, ; ," (
Bridgeport, Conn.
My dear, Mrs. Wallenta:'
V ,' Replying to your letter of the
5th ins., relative to rent of my
fiat, you are quite riglhit in your
assumption" that it might seem
, quite -a jump to increase my rent
$5 per month, and I think I un
derstand ,your position very clear
ly. ( '
In the first place, I have .stood
. for. a great many ' inconveniences- .
in the flat, I now occupy on ac
count of the, fact that I wanted to .
Jlve iii that district, and also that
we enjpyed the view. We have ,
taken care of many things in tine
flat that rightly should have been
taken : care of by you, and have ,
put up with conditions that we
felt, you should have taken care .
of.
I have just' been curious enougJi .
. to look up' the Increase on the
valuations on your property, and
find tihiat it does not warrant, in
any way, shape or manner such
an increase. The total Increase .
on your ) ten pieces of property .
will make an increase in taxation,
- based on the present rate,' of ap
proximately $ 6 3 and you wish me
to pay $ 6 0 of that increase, and
I only ocupy one-half of one of
your houses. ; On that particular
piece of your property that . I am
interested in. the increase will
be approximately $7.20 and still
assuming that the folks down-
stairs will be treated In the same
manner that we are, you are ask-
- an increase in your revenue of
$120.
s I consider this entirely unfair,
and of course will not stand for It. ,
I will ;mov.e out at the earliest
possible moment, for the rent is ,
not worth any more than you are
getting. And furthermore, if I
am -to understand that you are to
raise your rents as you say you '
are, I will feel that I am perfectly
justified, and will appear 'before
the Board of Relief and ask them
to increase the valuations on your
.property according to the scflned-
ule "you have represented in your
letter.
If I do not hear from .you to-
- morrow, I will call you up for
your decision in the matter, as I
feel that I must take this matter
"up with the Board of Relief at
the earliest possible moment.
In my own persona case, I do
not care, for I feel that I am able '
"to secure another rent, and also
to pay whatever the rent is worth, 1
' but the entire idea of landlords in
this city raising their rents so en
tirely out of proportion to what
the' increase in values, etc., are
is something which should be dis
couraged, and I purpose to do my
shre to bring this about.
"Very truly yours,
J. ALEX. H. ROBINSON.
Mr. Robinson Jias lived in the Wal
lenta house, 500 Seaview avenue, for
about seven years. His rent has been
$20 a month.' Robinson occupies half

lenta. owns much property. She said
today that the Robinson rent was the
made, affidavits here that, they had
been brought to this country . by an
agent of the Salt's Co., who paid their
passage and contracted to pay them
a certain wage. The affidavits were
placed in the hands of President Gol
den and after . the-attention of the
French consul was. called , to the case,
an investigation was begun by Agent
Hurley of the Boston Bureau of Im
migration. The action of the govern
ment is the outcome.

raise in rent Was so large. V In other
instances the , rent increases, follow-

- Mrs. Wallenta's letter from the city
clerk Is dated Feb. 7. - His Vent was
due .Feb. 15. When he sent his rent
check at that .time, the same figure
stood, 520. Mrs.) Wallenta then sent a
sheriff to the Robinson dwell'ng with
documents by which he was ordered
to quxt the premises. But rents are
scarce, and high. , If he pays the in
crease, he can stay. , At least, that's
what the neighbbrs .say. Meanwhile
Mrs.' Wallenta's telephone is busy, be
cause many rent seekers are after the
piaca. ,-, '.
Mrs.x Wallenta, on the list of 1914,
paid taxes on $34,860. The assessors
prepared the list of 1915 with Mrs
'Wallenta's values fixed at $43,360, an
increase or js.500. .But after Robin
son t rent was raised, the board of re
lief made a 'still further increase, with
the total $54,700. a total lump from the
list or 1914 of $19,840.

Edward L. Graves, the Fairfield ave
nue candy merchant, must pay $759.50

Graves bought two ice cream ma
chines from the plaintiff but refused
to pay for them. "
Graves claimed the machines were
unsatisfactory. He said employes of
the .plaintiff had made efforts to Jix
them, but without success and that in
1915 the machines were sent. back.
Judge Wilder found that since Graves
had used the machines for about a
year he should pay for them.

Three-Fold Purpose in
Trip to South Atlantic and
Polar Regions.
Sidney, N. S. W., March 24
Lieut. Sir Ernest Shackleton
has returned from his Antarc
tic expedition.,.
News of tha achievements of
the expedition is withheld for
the present.
Th adventure of Lieut.Nsir Ernest
Shackleton heading the British trans-
Atlantic expedition, had a three-fold
purpose to navigate Antarctica on a
meridian ; to secure for the British flag
the honor of being the first national
emblem tljus to be taken from sea to
tea across this south polar realm, and
to conduct scientific work relating,
among other phases, to meteorology,
geography, geology and geodetic sur
veys. Funds for the. purpose amount
ing to more than $300,000 were raised
including $50,000 from the British
government. '
The expedition left England in two
sections about six weeks after the
European war began, but it was not
until early In January, 1915 after de
lay due to unfavorable ice conditions
that the party headed by Sir Ernest
himself set off on their long voyage
from South .Georgia, an uninhabited
island in the South Atlantic Ocean
about 800 miles due. east' of Cape
Horn, for Ross Sea on the other side
of the South Pole.1 i
From Tasmania, on the New Zea
land .side of the Antarctic the second
section meanwhile had sailed, also for
Ross Sea, there to meet Sir Ernest's
expedition with supplies necessaryfor
both sections to return to New Zea
land. Sir Ernest hoped originally to
come out of the Antarctic by April,
1915 but conditions made necessary a
change of plan. The section which
started from Tasmania was forced to
spend the winter of 1915-16 at Ross
Sea to await Sir Ernest's arrival which
had . been expected some time this
month.
Sir Ernest sailed in the Endurance,.
a three-master, the foremast square-
rigged and the other 'tw , masts
schooner-rigged, her auxiliary engines
giving her 10 knot speed. This vessel,
of 360 ;tons, was built . with ( "wooden
walls"' two feet thick. '.
Her accommodations were for 32
persons' and the party which sailed'
Included 15 officers .. and scientists,
besides 70 dogs and a number of mo
tor sleds. The Ross Sea party sailed
on the Aurora In command of Lieut.
Aeneas Mackintosh, R.. N. R., who
was in charge also of the chronome
tres and meteorological instruments.
The Aurora carried 26 dogs. .
After leaving South Georgia, Sir
Ernest and his ' party, although
equipped with a limited wireless ap
paratus, had no communication with
the civilized world. I Friends of the
explorer, however, did not express
anxiety explaining that difficulties in
erecting and insulating masts on the
ice after tne party left the ship made
it improbable, if not impossible, 'that
he would be heard from, at least until
the homeward voyage from Ross Sea
was well under way.
The Argentine government present
ed for the Endurance a powerful wire
less receiving equipment when the
ship touched at Butnos Ayres late in
914 on its way to South eGorgia.
Thus prepared, the explorers hoped
before taking to the ice to pick up
aerpgrams .containing information as
to happenings in the ' outside world,
including news' of the war. They
knew they could not at that time
send messages telling of their own
progress. ,.

and latest reports of t'hie scouts would
indicate that the Kingston-O'Brien-Willis
faction has stolen a march on
the administration forces represented
by Deputy Sheriff Thomas Cunning

The first, named faction met last
night and organized a new Republican
club in the district which will be
known. as the Republican Party Sixth
District club. The organizers say
that the -word "Party" has been in
serted in the name of their? organiza
tion to indicate that its members are
real Republicans and not renegades j
from other parties. There were 120
present at the meeting last night fend
all signed the membership roll. The
new club has hired the club rooms
which the old club had, over the heads
of the members of that organization,
and on April 1 the old club must move
out so that the new club may move
in.
BehiAd this stolen march lies a
story of gfod political generalship.
Prior to the election last fall the
Stowe faction began a drive against
Charles C. Kingston, Who was a mem

from the district. The Stowe faction
threatened to place a second delegate
