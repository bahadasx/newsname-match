appropriation of $10,000 for tha
transfer and maintenance of 100 pa

six months of the year. Should they
be brought before Juts 1. the hospital
would not have adequate funds for

WITH FACTS ABOUT
COTTON GRAIN BAGS
Aftet having investigated at first
hand the manufacture of cotton bags
at Memphis, Tenn., and other places,
H. V Collins has returned to the
city with news the grain bag shortage
may be relieved by use or cotton bags
if such action becomes advisable.
Samples of the cotton bags were
brought home by Mr. Collins and
other samples are expected by mall
I today. These will tie shown to the
j local farmers tomorrow and It is pos
sible orders for the Vags will be plac
ed if so action may be taken
through the Inland Oralngrowers As
sociation or I))' individual farmers.
) The best cotton bag. and one suit-
able for the exportation of wheat,
i will cost almost as much as the Jute
j bag. The lighter hags are cheaper
In cost but there is some question as
to the udvlsability of their use. though
i It has been demonstrated they will
hold grain.
The advantage in the cotton bag
will be in certainty of securing sup
I lies. The Jute bags are for sale
only on a war proviso basis, the con
tracts allowing for cancellation at any
time Hence there Is no certainty of I
securing hags if ordered. According
to Mr. t'olllns. he learned In Chicago
of a further line of action by the Brit
ish government toward restricting the
sale of jute Bags The action Is along
the line of limiting the number of
bags to be sold to any individual.
