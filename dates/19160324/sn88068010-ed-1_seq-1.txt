THE STATEJCONVEHTION
liveliest Since New System.
Major Jammed Thru.
Harmonious.
The Democratic State Conven
tion held at St. Joe this week
was a peach in several respects.
The squabble over, the selection
of a national committeeman, the
interment of the turkey trot gov
ernor in the vice presidential
mausoleum and wrangle over
places on the delegation to the
national convention could and
should have been avoided in the
interest of the party. The trou
ble principally consists of the
fact that while Governor Major
has been eliminated from the
race for United States senator,
he has been left with a pull for
some good appointive office, and
it is reasonable to suppose, with
cood backing.
The delegation to the national
convention consists of Senator
William J. Stone and Senator
James A. Reed, Speaker Champ
Clark, Ex. Gov. Lon V. Steph
ens, Col. Bill Phelps, Judge Wal
ler. W. Graves. James Cowgill.
Dr. J. T. M. Johnson, delegates
at large, each with half vote; the
delegates from this second con-
eressional district are: J. W.
Clapp, Sullivan county; Joseph
Broaddus, Livingston county; al
ternates: T. J. Copeland, Chari
ton county; L. r. Kobinson,
Grundy county and G. F. Crutch
ley of Carroll elector.
It is not worth while to try to
disguise the fact that the resolu
tion recounting the alleged mer
itorious administration of the
governor who was sidetracked
away from the main line leading
to the U. S. Senate will meet
with general disfavor among
democrats in all parts of the
state, but it is a matter of rec
ord now and we will have to
meet the vulnerable act as best
we can.
Senator Stone Declined
Senator Wm. J. Stone declined
to allow the convention to use his
name in connection : with the
selection of delegates at large
to the national convention.
It is seldom that the distin
guished senior senator from this
state, who now ranks highest in
congress, makes a mistake i in
his moves. There are many men
of high attainments, political
and other, who desire no office;
who are just as devoted to the
interests of the democratic party;
who will represent the state at a
national convention as well as
any, and who will appreciate
highly such recognition every
time a convention is to name a
candidate, never desiring to enter
' the field for an office, who should
be accorded the honor of repre
senting the state.
How They Stand
The St. Louis Star polled the
state as far as it could to ascer
tain how the various candidates
for governor stood at this time in
. the estimation of voters, and
Friday published the following
as its information:

Lacy McDaniel, the one time
popular tailor, was here this week
visiting old cronies.
Justice George Young and wife
were in town the first of the
week on a visit to his sick mother.
Whereever the roads have
been dragged, and that is nearly
, all over the county, they are in
pretty good shape.
v Brunswick v will likely have
main street paved from the Wa
bash station to the extreme west
:' end of the city this summer.
The bridge on the highway
between this city and Brunswick
is in and travel on that road is
resumed. The mistake of plar
ing the bridge across Palmers
creek at the old site was a big
- one. The road should have been
opened south of the Wabash
" track and the bridge built south
of the Wabash bridge, shorten
ing the road and cutting out two
, crossings of the track.

NEW EDITQMN CHARGE
Recorder Sold to Kansas Publisher
Locates Permanently
Democratic.
Veteran newspaper man, ; all
round hustler and a good writer,
he still was physically unable to
continue the strenuous life of a
country editor and last Thursday
evening Mr. E. E. Rettig sold
the Recorder to Mr. A. J. Byerly
of Cherry vale, Kas., an old hand
at the business.
We regret losing Editor Rettig
from the field, but glad to learn
that he will remain a citizen and
probably a business man of our
city. He has simply "gone at it
too hard" and at his advanced
age, it was impossible to stand
under the work he had cut out
for himself. Moving, rearrang
ing the Recorder office, improv
ing not only the print but the
news and editorial department
of his paper and hustling for
business nearly got the goat or
the eenial oldtimer. and we re
peat, we regret that his strength
was not equal to the demand on it.
John Wesley Agee
It is not only in this immediate
community that deep sorrow is
felt over the loss by death of one
of the really good men of the
time is felt. There is no place
where he was known but that
some one who appreciates genuine
manhood is not grieving. Wes
Agee was one of those characters
not appreciated until lost Gentle,
kind, charitable to the limit un
pretentious and wholly forgiving
when wronsred if besought for
pardon, yet firm and constant in
his convictions without the least
offensive language or manner,
he was truly exceptional.
For thirty two years he was a
business partner of his brother
Wallace, and tho differing in al
most all characteristics, they
were the Cheruble Bros, in real
life.
Wes Agee began his . business
career as a' clerk in the irenerai
store of M. W. Anderson in this
city, then forming a partnership
with his brother Wallace, he en
tered the grocery and drug busi
ness in Dalton where they re
mained until 1891, coming to
this city and operating in the
grocery business until they
opened a clothing store in which
business they were engaged un
til his death.
Wes Agee was converted and
united with the Baptist church
when a young man, and at the
time of his death was teacher of
the Bible Class and treasurer and
his devotion to his religious prin
ciples and church was an example
well worthy following. He was
also a member of the school board
for this district, and treasurer of
the district He never sought
office or public preferment but
accepted responsibilities put up
on him as a duty and performed
his duties well.
In addition to his widow and
children, Elizabeth, Hortense,
Anderson, Everett and Gilbert
Fisher, his sister, Mrs. Minnie
Hurt and brother, Wallace G. he
leaves a number of relatives who
most deeply deplore his death.
John Wesley Agee was born on
the old Agee homestead south
east of town May 24, 1862, and
died, after several weeks illness
at his home in this city Monday
morning. Funeral services were
conducted at the Baptist church
Tuesday' afternoon by pastor
Rev. A. F. Haynes who preached
a most appropriate and accep
table sermon, and interment in
the city cemetery followed. The
tributes of respect by the busi
ness men and warm personal
friends and what was most un
usual evidence of the high esteem
in which the deceased was held,
was the sarro w of men with whom
he was not much associated nor
whose conduct he approved. The
floral offerings of love and esteem
by business men were many
and superb.
The son of Powhatan and Sarah
Perkins Agee, could he have
looked thru the casement of his
last earthly resting place, would
have beheld at home, at church
and grave that which in life he
perhaps little suspected, the
Warmest feeling of friendship
and deep attachment of many
he did not, know were friends
who paid him their last acts of
tenderest regard by their pre
sence. :' .

THE MEXICAN SITUATION
Villa Escaped, Gathering Friends
Pershing Pursuing Persistently
Trouble Ahead
General John J. Pershing and
others commanding forces in
pursuit of Pancho Villa in Mex
ico are confronted, according to
newspaper reports with having
to meet companies of deserters
from the regular Mexican army.
It is evident that a general re
volt will be on in a short time
and that Carranza will have to
look out for his scalp as well as
well as office. Gen. Herrera.
the commander of the govern
ment troops at Chihuahua, is re
ported to have revolted and de
clared war on the United States.
Carranza had relieved this gen
eral of his command, is reported.
Another report says that
Villista troops and Carranza sol
diers had engaged in a fight at
Casas Grandes.
Extreme heat and scarcity of
water and the extreme cold at
night are seriously affecting
Gen. Pershings command, and
soldiers are reported dropping
out in numbers with pneumonia
and dysentery.
Two aviators have been injured
in flights to locate Villa, and two
others who went out on scout
duty are missing.
EUROPEAN WAR
The heaviest fighting is still
around Verdun and the German
army making little advance. The
war in Afnca is about a draw so
far as important events reported
since last week. Russians have
made some inroads at points in
the east but a report that the
Germans had captured 9000 in
one battle about breaks even
wit h what gains said to have
been made by the allies.
You Will Hear It
In the April American Maga
zine an interview with Oscar W,
Underwood, author of the pres
ent tariff law: " The talk of
our needing a higher tariff to
meet after-war conditions has no
merit beyond being a political
argument,' declares Senator Un
derwood with smiling calmness.
Instead of lower wages in
Europe, it is possible that in
many lines of industry wages
will be higher. Obviously few
er men wil return to their jobs
than left their jobs to go to war.
This wil) tend to boost wages,
and with wages higher there will
be less difference than heretofore
in the labor cost of production
here and abroad.
" 'Moreover, there will not be
the facilities for manufacturing
the goods for export that there
was before the war. In Belgium
for example, many factories are
entirely destroyed. The organi
zation is destroyed also.
In all the belligerent coun
tries the great work of restoring
things to normal conditions will
doubtless require their chief at
tention and energy for a long
time. The bulk of their manu
factures will be required for their
own use, supplemented by much
that they must obtain from us.
The balance of trade will be in
our favor.' "

litical fences in satisfactory

Jake Ray was a visitor Mon
day. He has not been here for
months, evidently finding con
genial widows in his Chillicothe

LETTER ON MEXICO
by a Near Neighbor.
Numerous friends have asked
me so many questions concern
ing Mexico and the border situ
ation that I have decided to give
some information along this line,
as I have viewed it from the bor
der city of El Paso, Tex., during
the past 3 years. El Paso as you
doubtless know, is situated in
the extreme western part of
Texas, on the silvery Rio Grande,
but not silvery by any means,
but a dirty treacherous stream.
wending its way to the gulf.
hi Paso, as the word means
"The Pass," a pass between
two high mountains, one on
the American side and one on
the Mexican side, with the
Rio Grande flowing between.
El Paso is a modern, up-to-date
and a rapidly growing city of
70,000 people, one-half of the
population being Mexicans. Op
posite ElPaso over the RioGrande
is the Mexican city of Juarez
(Wharez). The two citie3 are
connected by two international
bridges and after crossing over
into old Mexico, one has a feel
ing of wishing he or she were
back on American soil, a3 it is
indeed another world. You feel
you have dropped into a city of
adobes that is mud buildings.
An adobe is &bout two inches
thick, six inches wide and twelve
to fourteen inches long, and are
made of mud and straw and
moulded by a wooden form into
adobes and dried in the sun and
in a few weeks are ready to be
put into the walls mud is here
used instead of mortar. These
houses stand for centuries; some
are nearly three hundred years
old in the city of Juarez. It
makes a very cheap and very
warm house, the roof being cov
ered with adobes also and only
the better class have wooden
floors, as the dirt floor is found
to be more economical.
A great many of the older homes
of El Paso are still standing of
adobes and when pebble dashed
are very pretty indeed, being of
the mission style of architecture.
In this city of Juarez you find a
population of about 20,000 and a
hard looking lot they are, all
bent on some form of amuse
ment, as a bull fight, chicken
fight, some gambling game or
other amusement. It has been
said that Juarez is the most
wicked city in the world, as here
the American tourist is often
relieved of all his valuables in a
short time, and left stranded
oftentimes disfigured and in a
sad predicament. It is not the
Mexicans that are responsible
for all the work as many Amer
ican crooks flee to that side to es
cape the ElPaso police and those
the American sight seers became
easy prey to their own country
men, although the Mexicans are
guilty of a great many of these
holdups. During the last few
months Juarez has been almost a
different city in some ways as
the new mayor has had a clean
up, and it is improved very much
and the people of ElPaso have,
been mighty glad of the change.
Juarez has aptly been called
the port of missing men, as dur
ing Gen. Francisco Villia (Via)
reign over the city there were a
few mysteriously disappeared
one an Englishman who was
murdered in cold blood, and a
German who had been seen in
side of (carcel) jail and was sup
posed to have been shot at sun
rise, against an adobe wall at the
old prison. Also two cr three
Americans mysteriously disap
peared along about the same
time two years ago. Hence, the
title "The port of missing men."
The only thing of interest and
beauty in this sun-baked city is
the Old Mission of Guadalupe,
founded by the early Spanish in
the 15th century and it stands
today three hundred years old
with walls six feet thick and will
continue to stand for 1000 years
unless destroyed by the hand of
man. It is very quaint and
pretty inside, the ceiling being
of huge beams of mahogony
wood, hand carved by the early
indians. The statues of the
saints are all very beautiful, the
Virgin Mary having been
brought over to this country by
early Spanish settlers who con
quered Mexico under Cortez and
then pushed north and founded
the Mission of Guadalupe.
A great many of the Mexicans
are very devoted to the Catholic
church while lots of them are
avowed and bitter enemies, such
