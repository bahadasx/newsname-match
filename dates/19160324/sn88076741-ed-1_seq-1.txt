PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
More than a month ha9 elapsed since
the German drive began at Verdun.
Daring the last week the cannonading
has been nearly continuous and the Ger
suns have made heavy assaults at dif
ferent points particularly to the north
east and the north west of the city.
None of these assaults have been suc
cessful otherwise than the gaining of a
little here and there. In most case9
these assaults in force make consider
able gains at the first and then most of
the area gained is lost through counter
assaults. How much longer the Ger
aans can carry on this already lengthen
ed light remains to be seen.
A spectacular battle in the clouds was
one of the events of the week. About
fifty aeroplanes on either 3ide were par
ticipants near Verdun. The French le
ports claim the destruction of five
German planes and the loss of three of
their own.'
A small naval battle occurred off the
Flemish coast. Three small German
destroyers were seen by four or five
English vessels of about the same cluss
The German ships ran for shore protec
tion and the English followed with an
easuing running fight. Both sides claim
te have damaged the others but nothing
serious occurred.
Peace rumors are again plenty, but
whether inspired by authority or just
from the wish is not certain. That all
the warring nations must be getting
tired is practically certain. Germany
undoubtedly is now at her extreme maxi
mum of battle strength, which means
that from this time on she is likely to
grow weaker rather than stronger.
France is practically in about the same
cigadition, while England has for the
last six months been straining every
power except actual conscription to put
every available man in the army. Rus
sia should still have plenty of reinforce*
ments, but so far in this war that
country seems to be able to put about so
•any men in the field without any great
increase. Of course neither country
oaves at this time to openly say they are
tiled, because it would be construed to
SBSSB a confession of detest.
Oar o«nt war is "progressing."

is a very strict censorship as to the
movement of the U. fc3. troops, but all
the same the daily papers give minute
details every day both as to numbers
,and positions. The Mexican de facto
.j. government seems somewhat reluctant
to give this country and special encour
agement in our chase for Villa but have
4* so far granted most of our requests and
^jCarrnnza troops are also chasing Villa.

THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY.
This presidential primary election is
the culmination of the absudities of the
primary system.
Founded 011 the pnncip'e that each
and every voter should and would make
an intelligent choice of the names that
he might find on the printed ballot, it
has developed into a case of a dog chas
ing his own tail.
The intelligent voter today, as we
write, goes inlo the th and takes a
printed list of names out of bis pocket,
finds the corresponding imes on the
ballot ami then checks them off with his
cross accordingly. He wouul ive time
and bother if allowed to just vote the
printed card, whi-h is almost identical
with the ballot be used before we bad a
primary law. With all the many pages
of primary law we have gone around the
circle and vote Just as we used to do in
effect.
The average voter knows almost no
thing of the persons named on the print
ed ballot, and has a very slight idea how
these names of delegates to the national
convention, presidential electors and na
tional committee men happen to be on
the baliots. While he still has the pri
vilege of changing any or all names he
may find there, he knows that would be
of no consequence, so mostly be will
"bear his cross" on the ballot as he
finds it.
The election machinery of this elec
tion is a mixture and muddle to which
we have previously referred.
Another phase occurred in this city
today. In two of the Wards in this city
democratic judges appointed by the de
mocratic committee appeared to take
their places as judges of election under
the primary law. Now it happened that
these two were the same men who had
been selected by the city council to act
in that capacity. But if the judges thus
appointed by two different authorities
had not happened to be the same men,
which of them would have been the
authorized and lawful officials of elec
tion?
Would or could judges appointed un
der the general primary election law
have any authority to conduct a city or
a township election?
If the judges selected by the party
committees act as such officials, are they
county or are they local election officers?
If they are county offices ought not
the county to pay them?
If tbey are city or township officials
who pays the "inspector" who has no
thing whatever to uo with the local
election, perforris no service for the
township or city, and is not known or
named in township or city government?
Who is to pay for taking the returns
to Cavalier?
If the county board pays these mes
sengers as thiy did four years ago, why
should they not pay the rest of the elec
tion board?
If the provincial contests result as
predicted, and the Dominion law as fore
showed 'rom Ottawa
is
enacted, the pro
baoilities are that in a year's lime a
portion of the province of Quebec will
be the only place left in Canada where
it will be possible to buy or sell liquor,
or to import it for drinking purposes.—

MISERABLE HAPPINESS
It is a somewhat curious fact that
mankind rather enjoys misery. The
pursuit of sorrow is equally one of the
"inalienable righes of mankind" as the
pursuit of happiness. Thousands of
people wear black clothing with a sort
of satisfaction. In a lesser degree it is
the same kind or spirit that makes the
martyr sing hymns while the flames roar
about him.
Again, there is nothing more easy than .ate St Patrick color scheme?,
to persuade the' average man that he is|
sick or miserable. A hearty, healthy
man who on going down town in the
as they pass to the effect that he does
not look well, is likely to call the doctor
this remarkable sensitiveness to personal
injury of all sorts, is the favorite i-hord
upon which politicians, political
