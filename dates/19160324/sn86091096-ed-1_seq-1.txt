Canal Opens
On April 15
Official Date Set for Re-open
ing of Traffic _
An"official prediction that the
Panama canalJwillibeJre-openedRby
April il 5 f orjthef passagej of^deep
draft vessels, wasjannounced yester
C day'.byithe'warjdepartment. *
Conditions'injGaillardJcut, scene
of the principal earth movement
which blocked the waterway last
fall, are regarded^as justifying the
forecast.
Re-opening ^f .the "great ^water
way is regarded'as'an ^engineering
feat second only~to*the'construction
of the canal.
Millions of tons of rock and
earth have been torn out of the
collapsed excavations. New dredges
of ajsize and capacity never before
employed have labored night and
day for months. Steam shovels
have driven their wav into the ob
structions wherever there was
ground sufficiently firm to hold
them.
In the meantime the construction
work at the terminals and about the
locks have proceeded without pause.
When the canal is re-opened it will
have advanced in equipment far be
yond the point it had reached when
the slides began. Facilities for
quick handling of ships will be
much better than they were at that
time and the great project closer to
final completion in all details.
Home Talent Play Tonight
The play which will be given
under the auspices of the Presby
terian church, promises to be a
most interesting performance. It
has taken much time and work to
make the necessary arrangements
for putting on a play of this kind.
The management has gone so far as
to have new scenery painted and
this will be used for the first time
in Kendrick.
It is useless to go into detail
further. The fact'that it is" given
under the direction of the Presby
terian church, makes it deserving
of your patronage. The cast of
characters, given below, is a posi
tive guarantee of an evening of
solid enjoyment, to all those who
are fortunate enough to be there.
Following the play there will' be a
picture show presenting the six
teenth espisode of the "Broken
Coin."
The cast of characters for the
play are as follows:
David Moore, of Maple Farm
Cottage, L. G. Peterson; Susan
Moore, his wife, Mrs. Joday Long;

Course
The last number on the lyceum
course, The Maurer Sisters Orches
tra, presented a very delightful
evening's entertainment. The pro
gram was a varied one and the
audience showed appreciation by
frequent encores.
The managers of the lyceum
course are pleased with the support
the people of Kendrick and vicinity
have given them. The series of
five entertainments netted above all
expenses $112.70. This will be
applied on the public school piano
fund.

Contest Between Winners
a
Lewis, and Nez Perce and adequate
prizes will be awarded to the grand
prize winners.
The spelling contest between rep
resentatives of Latah county schools
held at the Moscow high school
Saturday night was largely attend

the contest. There were 16 contest
ants out of 22, Deary, Princeton,
and Bovill not being represented.
Kendrick was represented with 2
contestants instead of 3. Carl Hal
storm of Troy, 13 years of age,
carried off the first prize with a
percentage of 99 and he will repre
sent the county at the Inland
Empire contest at the Spokane
Interstate fair in September. For
rest Hedden of Moscow, 13 years

intendent.
The contest was made up of 100

list and were harder than those used
in last year's contest. The contest
showed more interest in spelling and
a higher efficiency than last year.
No boys were winners last year
while two were winners this year.
Some of the gyade pupils furnish
ed a musical program under direc
tion of Miss Kendrick. The judges
of the written spelling were Miss

Clean-Up Week
April 9 to 15
Governor Designates Time
For General Clean-up
it
Health and attractiveness of com
munities demand that following the
close of the winter season and be
fore the beginning of the summer's
heat there should be a general
cleaning up of the unclean deposits
of animal and vegetable matter and
other debris which cannot be pre
vented from accumulating by any
measure of precaution that can be
enforced, in order that filthy, un
clean, unheal thful and unsightly
conditions may not prevail, gen
erating and spreading disease and
breeding pestilential insects.
It is deemed advisable and most
conducive to a general renovation
whereby no one may have excuse
for delay or negligence to the det
riment and danger to the health of
himself, his family, or of his neigh
bors to set apart a week wherein all
good citizens are called upon, not
alone to see that their own premises
are set in order, but that a whole
some and effective community spirit
may be created.
Therefore, I, M. ALEXANDER,
Governor of the State of Idaho, do
designate and set apart the week
beginning April 9, and ending April
15, as "CLEAN-UP WEEK" for
the State of Idaho, and I do call
upon all citizens and all communities
to give every possible effort toward
making effective the spirit and pur
pose of this proclamation by devot
ing their time, attention and ener
gies to a cleansing and renovation
of premises belonging to and ad
jacent to their places of abode.
In Testimony Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caused
the great seal of the State to be
affixed this eleventh day ot March,
1916.
M. ALEXANDER, Governor.
Attest : George R. Barker, Secretary
of State.

Field Peas A '
Profitable Crop
Pea Culture on Palouse Farm
Gives Great Results
The farmers throughout the
central Idaho country are this year
showing a keen interest in the im
provement of the rural highways
and the use of drags is general
where the roads have sufficiently
dried to permit of improvement
work. The reports made by over
seers are to the effect that farmers
are willing to pledge the necessary
work where drags are furnished
and statment is made that all rural
highways will be in good condition
within the next few weeks.
of
The general use of drags for the
improvement of the rural roads has
been urged for several years. The
campaign was inaugurated when
Mr. King, inventor of the King
split-log drag, was brought to the
central Idaho country for a number
of addresses on building dirt roads.
He advocated the use of the drag
and gave demonstrations at a nupi
ber of points where drags had been
constructed for the purpote.
The King campaign was followed
by the use of drags at a number of
points in each of the central Idaho
counties and the results were so
of
at
satisfactory that the counties were
induced to purchase metalic drags ;
for the districts where logs are
not available for the construction !
of drags. It has been found that j
the metallic drag produced about
the same results as the implement ]
recommended by Mr. King and this
year the commissioners of Nez
Perce county were induced to make
a sufficient purchase to provide all
districts of the county with one or
more drags.
The value of the drag system of
improvement is said to lie in the prin
ciple of moving the dirt in thin
layers from the sides toward the
crown of the driveway. In this
manner the foundation of the
way remains undisturbed, but the
low places are filled and a perfect
drainage is provided. The layers
of dirt are hammered into place by
the hoofs of the horses, while the
continuous rolling of the wheels of
vehicles soon provides a waterproof
surface.
William Cain
Mr. William Cain died at his
home on American ridge about .three
o'clock Wednesday mornjpg, after a
lingering illness. The cause of his
death was pernicious anemia.
Mr. Cain lived on one of the
farms owned by Claus Eichner,
which he has rented for several
years. He was forty-one years
of age and of English descent, his
birth place being the Isle of Man.
He leaves a wife and two children,
Phyllis and James and a brother.
The funeral will beheld on Ameri
can ridge, Friday, March 24.
Why Not Have
A Public Library
New Enterprise Being Talk
ed-up For Kendrick
The Library is by far the most
conservative and inexpensive enter
prise now before the people of Ken
drick. By a library, we don't mean
a stuffy room filled with unprofitable
books, but a large airy, room on the
ground floor nicely furnished and
reasonably equipped with papers,
magazines and books. Rest room
would probably be a better name
or the Kendrick Klub would be
sufficiently alliterative to satisfy
demands.
There is something in a name
Shakespeare to the contrary not
withstanding. The term "library"
sounds well but is not attractive.
Any thing in the nature of a club
will draw. Our suggestion is a
combination of all the good features
of a Library, Rest room and Club.
There should be a rest room for out
of town visitors, farmers wives and
others who are often obliged to
wait for hours in places, too, where
they do not always feel over wel
come.
Let us get together on some fea
sible scheme for promoting the pub
lic welfare along lines suggested
above. Let no one say it can't be
done. Other villages have done and
are doing even greater things. If
the women, through their various
organizations would only start some
thing; or if the preachers would
get busy it might help some. There
is enough "influence" somewhere to
create a sensation in town if it can
only be driven from under cover.
Band Uniforms
The Kendrick Band has ordered
about thirty new uniforms and they
are expected to be here in time to
be used early this spring. The
band is practicing every week so
that some good music may be ex
pected. An organization of this
band, *
front,
collar,
collar,
kind is deserving of all the patron
age that Kendrick can give it for
a good band is a boost for any town,
; The uniforms will be of kahki
cloth of good material. The caps
! are full bell top. gold front strap,
j side buttons, wide braid
metal wreath and lyre on
] The coats have military
fly front, trimmed around collar,
down front, around bottom, up
side vents and back seams and on i
sleeves with one and a quarter
i nc h mohair braid, traced with
narrow soutache braid. Trousers 1
trimmed down outside seams with
braid, regular hip watch, and side
pockets,
The uniforms will cost the
; approximately three hundred
high-'dollars. This is rather a big under
taking for the band boys but some
the ladies of Kendrick have
promised to give entertainments
and socials to hel P defray the ex *
pense.

Miss Agnes Petrick was in Mos
cow Saturday, returning Saturday
band
night.
Study Club Enter
tained Husbands
St. Patrick'* Party at The
McCrea Home
a
to
Last Friday evening, March 17th,
the Kendrick Study Club entertained
their husbands at their annual St.
Patrick's party. Mrs. W. M.
McCrea was a very able hostess and
her many guests found a warm
welcome awaiting them at "The
Highlands." The splendid McCrea
home was artistically decorated in
honor of Ireland's patron saint with
green flags, imprinted with golden
harps, and other seasonable em
blems. One of th^ interesting
features of the decorations was real
shamrock growing in small pots
placed on several tables in the
house. The hue of the orange was
very, very conspicuous by its ab
sence.
The parly is one of the three
annual affairs given by the ladies
club, the other two being the
Christmas Party and the June Pic
nic. At these annual affairs the
husbands of the Club members are
allowed to occupy seats as visitors
and enjoy the entertainment given
by the ladies during the evening.
All the male visitors, were unani
mous in declaring that they had en
joyed themselves hugely during the
course of the entertainment.
A fine musical program was ren
dered which, with the book reviews
and readings, constitutes the regu
lar form of Study Club meetings.
Each number was well prepared;
and, if quality is to be measured,
by the applause received, each en
tertainer was considered the best.
During the evening the following
program was given :
Piano Duet, Mrs. McCrea_Miss Hoyt
"That's an Irish Lullaby,"
Mrs. Joday Long
"Belle Mahone," Male Quartett
"Con Amore"_PianoSolo, Miss Hoyt
Talk on Irish Players, Mrs. J. E. Hoyt
"Kathleen Mavourneen"_Solo,
Mrs. Wenzlaff.
"Killarney"_Solo, Mrs. H. Helpman
"Then You'll Remember Me"_Solo,
Mrs. Best
Talk on St. Patrick's life and work,
Miss Byrne
Talk on Irish Music, Mrs. J. T. Moser
"Maggie" and "It Followed,"
Male Quartette
"Somewhere A Voice Is Calling,"
Miss Schuyler
One of the hits of the evening
was the whistling solo of Miss Mary
Mellison who rendered "Aloha Oe"
in an especially pleasing manner.
During a pause in the regular pro
gram, four Kappa Kappa Sorority
girls from the University of Idaho
serenaded the Club with sorority
and college songs. At a late hour
dainty refreshments were served,
after which the guests departed.
