BEE'S CINCINNATI
RIVER CONTEST !
Running Along Nicely Sev
eral of the Contestants
are Taking Much
Interest
MISS KATIEJUM AHEAD
The Bee's Cincinnati River Trip
contest is growing in popularity right
along and quite a number of the con
testants are at work. They seem to
realize that this week's outing with
the stop overs in Louisville and Cin
cinnati is well worth working for, to
say nothing of the valuable $50.00
silver service set that goes to the
party holding the highest number of
votes at end of contest. Since the
addition of the four page comic sup-1
rilemcntwith every Friday's Bee and!
the great improvement in local newr.j
... . I
and school news, it is much easier tc
get anyone to give up a dollar, for a
year's subscriplion. All the contest
ant has to do is ask the people to
subscribe. Miss Katie Clark, of
Nortonville, stands at the head of the
list this week with Mrs. Ed Hamer
second, Miss Bertha Stanley, of Mor
tons Gap, third, Miss Ola Robinson,
of St. Charles.fourth, John Fenwick
of this place, fifth, and Harold Old
ham sixth.

"Nothing is more foolish, nothing moro utterly at varlanco with sound
public policy than to enact a law which, by reason of tho conditions sur
rounding tho community in which it is declared to bo law is lncapablo of
enforcement. Such an lnstanco is sometimes presented by sumptuary laws,
by which tho sale of intoxicating liquors is prohibited under penalty In
localities whero tho public sentiment of tho immediate community does not
and will not sustain tho enforcement of tho law. In such cases the legislation
is usually tho result of agitation by peoplo in tho country who aro determined
to make their fellow citizens in tho city better. Tho enactment ot the law
comes through tho country representatives, who form a majority of tho
lecislaturo: but tho enforcement ot
generally opposed to its enactment,
is a dead letter. This result is tno great argument in ravor 01 so-called local
option, which is really an Instrumentality for determining whether a law
can bo enforced before it is mado operative. In cases whero the salouof liquor
cannot bo prohibited in fact, it is far better to regulate and diminish tho
evil than to attempt to stamp it out. By the enactment of a drastic law and
tho failure to enforce It thcro is injected into the public mind the Idea that

Ex-Prosldent Wm. H. Taft, in giving his views on
prohibition, said la part: ,
"Ours Is a government by law; not by rule of thumb,
but by rules of conduct which havo equal application to
all. Any exception to tho equal operations of tho law
upon Individuals is necessarily most Injurious to th'o
future operation of that law for tho public good, becauso
ono exemption from its operation Is certain to lead to
others. Tho public dotrlmont arising from violations ot
law, followed by immunity from prosecution or punish

of tho legislator In tho enactment of laws to consider tho

Earlington Inter
est in the Week's
Conflagrations
Nashville's big fire which raged
throughout Wednesday afternoon
started near the East Nashville Yards
of the St. Bernard Mining Co. By
the united efforts of the employees
of a nearby factory and the men em
ployed at the coal yard the St. Ber
nard buildings and sheds were pro
tected from the falling embers, and
this and adjoining property was saved
by hard work. A large lumber yard
and two important plants adjoining '
would probJbly have been destroyed
but for this good work in protection
of the St. Bernard building.
Kinfolks of Mrs A. G. Spillman
her brother in law and children, re
siding in East Nashville were burned
out and besides losing his home and
contents suffered loss of three other
dwelling houses, which were occu
pied by tenants.
Conductor Ed Beal lost his dwell
ing house and.contents His house
hold g-oods had been moved out, but
the danger seemed to lessen and they
were put back in the dwelling only
to be destroyed later, together the
building and all contents were lost
An aunt of Miss Mary Ellen Burk
lost her house and contents.
W. S. Brarrwell lives in East
Nashville, but was some distance
from the fire zone, and so his prop

and another sister living at Augusta.
