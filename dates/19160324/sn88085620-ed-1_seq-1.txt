EXPLOITERS OF BABES
ALWAYS FIND EXCUSES
INDIANAPOLIS. —The United Mine
Workers' Journal pays its respects to
James A. Emery, attorney for the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers
who arrpeared before the senate com
mittee in opposition to the Keating-
Owen federal child labor bill.
Mr. Emory assured the committee
ho was opposed to child labor, hut
in this instance the proposed act was
"clearly unconstitutional." The Mine
Workers' Journal makes this com
ment :
"Oh, no! Mr. Emery and those
whom he represents do not favor the
exploitation of the babies In indus
try! But when laws for the preven
tion thereof are introduced in the leg
islatures of the various states, Mr.
Emery, or some other representative
of the same association, will be found
pleading against such laws; urging
the competitive conditions that have
to be met from the states where the
same industries are conducted.
"If Mr. Emory would say what is
in his heart it would be: 'Save to my
masters the profits that they can reap
from the exploitation of these babes;
education would only mean further
injury to the interests that pay me
my salary, for education is the end of
ignorance, and the educated men or
women cannot he exploited as freely
as the ignorant.'
"Whenever measures are under con
sideration that contemplate safeguard
ing the workers in the industries, re
strictions on the exploitation of the
women or children, laws that would
make toward the uplift of humanity,
there will be found representatives of
the organized workers, pleading for
the enactment of such laws, and ever
will bo found the highly-paid repre
sentatives of the Manufacturers' As
sociation, crying to high heaven their
purity of purpose, their interest in the
uplift of those who toil, but finding
specious objections to any measures
that might make for a higher, better
civilization, and cajoling, bribing, or
threatening the legislators, the execu
tives and the judges to the end that
laws that may in any measure threat
en to reduce the power of the owners
of the resources of the country may
not be enacted, or become effective."
JEWELRY WORKERS WINNING
NEW YORK. —Jewelry workers an
nounce that they are winning their

LOW WAGE GIRLS STRIKE
CUMBERLAND, Md.—A score of
girls employed by the Footer's dye
works at a wage of $4.50 per week,
are on strike to enforce higher rates.
A request that working conditions he
improved was also rejected by the
management. Because of benzine used
in the cleaning of gloves, the girls
were continually drenched in the oil.
Their lunches, kept in the same room,
were often unfit to eat. With the as
sistance of the Trades Council the
strikers have been organized.
SEVEN-HOUR DAY STANDS
WASHlNGTON—Congressman Bor
land's attempt to lengthen the work
day of Washington government clerks
from seven to eight hours was de
feated by large majorities on three
separate votes, after the chair had
ruled that the motion to make it a
"rider" to an appropriation bill was
out of order. Congressman Borland
then introduced a resolution which
provided for a 10 per cent, reduction
of the number of clerks and that hours
he increased to equalize the loss of
service to the government. This
resolution was defeated. A motion
to recommit the resolution was also
defeated. As the house was sitting
as in committee of the whole, no rec
ord vote was taken.
The attempt to lengthen the clerks'
work day was opposed by'the Ameri
can Federation of Labor. President
Gompers agreed that hours should he
equalized, but insisted that the work
day of mechanics and other workers
who now labor eight hours and long
er should be shortened instead of the
clerks' hours lengthened.
The agitation has resulted in the
formation of a Federal Civil Service
Employes union, chartered by the
American Federation of Labor. Hun
dreds of clerks are joining this or
ganization.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
WILL NOT SATISFY MEN
WASHINGTON. —During the forty
eiglil hours' strike of street car men
in this city officials of the two com
panies expressed great surprise that
their employes did not appreciate the
so-called profit-sharing schemes and
benefit associations that were, con
ducted for Hieir benefit.
The employes' position is well stat
ed in the following editorial in the
Washington Times, under the caption,
"Rights Wanted, Not Bribes":
"The employes of the street railway
companies will not be satisfied for
long if they are bribed with benefits,
allowances, profit-sharing plans, and
relief organizations, into surrendering
fundamental human rights.
"It is reported that the officers of
the street car corporations are tell
ing their men that rtdief and profit
sharing projects will be impossible if
the men insist on organizing and
going ahead with the independent
conduct of their relations with their
employers. That sort of argument
will in the end fail. The human right
of organizing, of negotiating cooper
atively, of dealing as a unity of hu
manity with a unit of money and
management, will have to be conced
ed.
"Men organize into cities, towns,
townships, provinces, states, nations,
in order more effectively to serve,
their individual ends through united
action. They organize into corpora
tions in order to pool their capital for
more effective use. It is too late in
civilization's processes for assump
tion that labor may not organize
where politics, society, capital, every
thing else, may do so.
"Grant first of all the right of men
to organize. Let them have their
union. It will be good for them and
for the corporations and for the pub
lic.
"Then treat with them, through the
union. '
"There would be as much sense in
the street railroad stockholders, as
individuals, trying to treat with the
employes, as for the employes, as in
dividuals, trying to treat with the
corporate entities. It Is neither fair
nor possible. Moreover, the effort to
maintain such a doctrine smacks quite
too much of the seventeenth century.
This is the twentieth."

OHIO STRIKE CAUSES
TO BE MADE PUBLIC
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio- Prosecuting
Attorney Henderson of Mahoning
county is preparing for an early trial
of Judge Gary of the United States
steel corporation and the officers of
five other steel concerns who were
indicted last, week by the grand Jury.
While steel and iron company exe
cutives make light of these indict
tnents, the following portion of the
grand jury's report indicates that the
trial will at least develop a few edu
cational features on working condi
tions in the steel industry in this
vicinity:
"We find, however, that there is an
underlying cause hack of not only the
strike and the dissatisfaction prevail
ing among the men prior to the strike,
but of the riot itself, a cause which
will he shown upon the trial of some
of the corporations and individuals
against whom charges have been
made by this jury as shown by the
indictments returned herewith, This
evidence is not of such nature as
should be exposed by this report, hut
is such as will undoubtedly be un
covered to tlie satisfaction of the
court and of the public in further le
gal proceedings in connection with
this investigation. We are firmly of
the opinion that not only will this evi
dence show a lawless condition of af
fairs surrounding the labor conditions
existing in and about the steel indus
tries of this valley but will also in
dicate an absolute disregard on the
part of certain corporations and indi
viduals indicted by us, either of the
rights of, or justice to, the laboring
classes or of the public genera-Hy."
COURT SUSTAINS TEACHERS
COLUMBUS, O.—Cleveland school
teachers, who are fighting in the
courts for the right to belong to a
union, have won an important tech
nical point in the state supreme court
which has overruled a motion to dis
miss the teachers' petition that the
decision of a court of appeals be re
viewed.
Two years ago the teachers organ
ized a union and affiliated with the
Cleveland Federation of Labor. The
board of education adopted a resolu
tion against teachers joining the
union. The common pleas court is
sued an injunction restraining the
board from executing the resolution
and later found the superintendent of
public schools guilty of contempt.
This decision was reversed by the
court of appeals, sitting in Toledo. A
petition in error was then filed by the
teachers in the supreme court, and
this tribunal has just overruled a mo
tion of their opponents to dismiss the
petit ion.

INDICTMENT OF MINERS
IS A "FESTERING SORE
Washington, D. C -Pres. Wilson's
special Colorado Ci strike commis
sion has presented : report on Colo
rado conditions to the chief execu
tive. They also tender their resigna
tions for the reason that the recently
created state commission, they say, Is
"amply equipped by law to deal with
all phases of the problem."
The commission Bays that of 400 ml
dietments returned in Colorado in
connection with si tike troubles, all
were against strikers, and that this
has left a "festering sore" on public
opinion.
"Some of the citizens of Colorado,"
the report continues, "believe that
many illegal acts were committed on
the part of the operators and the jus
tice which finds all the indictments
on one side does not seem to them
even handed.
"Your commission naturally ex
presses no opinion as to the correct
ness of this belief. It simply calls at
tention to the existence of this feel
ing. Again it is believed by some
even among the operators, that in
many of these eases the state has
not sufficient evidence to convict.
"As long as this condition of affairs
exists, the industrial health of Colo
rado will he weakened by this fester
ing sore. It is not the business of
your commission to weigh the rights
and wrongs of the ease, but we should
fall short of our duty if we did not
call attention to this feature of the
situation and emphasize the import
ance to the state of providing a
prompt remedy."
Seth Low of New Yoslt City, Chas.
W. Mills of Philadelphia, and Pat
rick Gilday ot Clearfield, Pa., com
posed the commission. The latter is
a member of the United Mine Work
ers' Union.

".Musicians did not want to mingle

"There is not the slightest danger

DENVER PAPER CRIES "QUITS"
DENVER, Col.—The discharge of
four miners in Judge Denison's court
at Castle Rock, together with the de
barment by the supreme court of
Judge Hillyer. ex-coal operators' at
torney, from further consideration of
miners' cases, has a sobering effect
on those influences that are deter
mined lo "railroad" trade unionists to
the state penitentiary because of their
activity in the recent coal strike.
The Rocky Mountain Xews. in a
leading editorial, makes this sugges
tion :
"We believe no good can come from
continuing these blanket prosecutions.
If this continues the matter will again
be dragged into partisan politics and
into the coining stale campaign. The
stale executive ought to take the mat
ter in his own hand and declare an
amnesty."
TO AID SMELTER MEN
DENVER.—The Labor Bulletin of
this city says:
"The long fight, begun in 1898, by
organized labor in Colorado to secure
an eight-hour day for employes in
mines, smelters and cement mills,
will again he taken up in the near fu
ture by the organized forces and at
the request of employes in these in
dustries an attempt will he made to
have those parts of the laws that were
not adopted in the meantime placed
upon the statute books of the state.
"The recent 'flag of truce,' offered
by John D. Rockefeller. Jr., and pieced
together from the blood-stained gar
ments of the victims of Ludlow, has
been accepted by the company's hire
lings and thugs, but in spirit it has
never received the approval of the
company's employes.
"The spying system of the Colorado
Fuel & Iron company makes it tin Im
possibility for any one to demand de-
Cent working conditions from Ihese
interests and remain in their employ.
"Therefore it becomes necessary
for outsiders to take up the fight for
human rights in the interest of the
workers in the rod mills, roller mills,
smelters, blast furnaces and cement
works that are controlled by these in
terests."
COLORADO MINERS ACQUITTED
DENVER, Col. —Four members of
the United Mine Workers' Union have
been declared not guilty of murder
by a jury in Judge Ilenison's court at
Castle Rock. Douglas county. The
miners were charged with killing
Major Lester, and their prosecution
was directed hy State Attorney Gen
eral Farrar
The verdict is a blow to Colorado
mining interests that have secured
the indictment of hundreds of former
strikers These interests originally
intended to have the miners tried be
fore Judge Hillyer, ex-coal company
attorney, whose appointment as a
judge was made after the last legis
lature created a special district court
The miners, however, blocked this
scheme by an order from the state
supreme court which debars Hillyer
from further consideration of these
cases, and the verdict at Castle Rock
is the result.

Colorado Workers
Make Big Gains
GOVERNOR CARLSON S
MIDDLE AGES' EDICT
DENVER, Col.—Because several
hundred smeltermen at Leadville sus
pended work In defiance of a state
law. which makes it illegal for work
era to strike until they have given
state authorities SO days* notice. Gov
ernor Carlson threatened these work
ers with all the power of the state if
they did not return to their emplov-j
ment.
The effort to drive these employes
back to work sounds like a pronuncia
mento of the Middle Ages, while tie
state's executive plea for law observ |
ance in this case loses weight when
one recalls the debauchery of Colo
rado last year by mine operators.
This is Governor Carlson's thunder
ous declaration:
"Tin- striking smeltermerj at Lead
ville are guilty of a brazen and insol
ent defiance of that provision of tin
industrial law which compels r,O days'
notice to the industrial commission
before men can go out upon a strike
The strikers are foreigners and it
was thought for a time that their ig
norance of our language caused an
inadvertent violation of this law's
most important provision.
"Tlie industrial commission, there
fore, requested the Austrian consul
to translate the law's provisions to
the strikers. This was dour and, to
the amazement of all, kno.vledge of
the law met with insulting and defi
ant refusal to obey it. Th f a course
of action was surprising, indeol, for
heretofore both employers ami em
ployes have willingly abided by the
law's provisions. The course of ac
tion by men who claim this country's
protection and enjoy its advantages
present a most sinister aspect and
calls for the firmest enforcement of
the law's penalties.
"I am informed that these men, be»
cause of their numbers, feel safe in
their present criminal conduct. They
are following foolish counsel for, if
the local police are unable to enforce
the court's mandates, the entire ma
chinery of the state government, if
necessary, will be brought into action
promptly and effectively "
VIOLATE LAW BY STRIKING
LEADVILLE, Col.—Practically all
of the 600 striking smcltermen em
ployed by the American Smelting and
Refining company have returned to
work or left the district. The=e wot It
ers arc unorganized ?nd unable to
speak the English laiigdnga and ttsey
suspended work without complying
with a law passed by the last leg sta
ture which makes it a misdemeanor
to strike before giving the state in
commission 30 days' notice.
The strike was causal by increased
-voik being demanded, eompeVee to
■eouro employment thront'h an agent
who (.barges excessive fees, forced
to patronize one store and because
pay cPecks are "shaved" by a com
pany favorite.
When the strike started the entire
machinery of the state was put in
motion to enforce a law that denies
men the right to quit their employ
ment when conditions are onerous.
Attorney General Parrar announced
that while all the strikers would not
be arrested, because of insufficient
jail accommodations, the lead, rs
would be charged with law violation.
Governor Carlson publicly declared
that every force would be brought to
bear against the strikers, and Chair
man McLaughlin of the state indus
trial commission announced: "The
whole power and authority of the
state of Colorado will stand hack of
and support the authorities of Lake
county and punish any and all crimes
against the state."
The strike has awakened Colorado
trade unionists to the power of this
law and also to the fact that they
cannot quit their employment "for!
any or no reason," as they have al
ways believed.

I COLORADO OFFICIALS
PERMIT A STRIKE
DENVER, Col, After an investiga
tion thai started last November, the
state industrial commission has an
nounced that the demands of the
Denver Journeymen Tailors' union
are just.
Tbis means that the tailors can
now strike, if necessary to enforce
their demands, without violating a
law passed by the last legislature.
This law provides that a strike is a
misdemeanor, punishable by fine, un
less the employes give at least thirty
days' notice to the state industrial
commission before they exercise what
was heretofore conceded a fundamen
tal right—quit work for any reason
On September 30 last the Journey-
men Tailors' union notified the com
mission that it desired higher wages
j and better working conditions. Num-
I berlesa hearings have been held and
j volumes of testimony contributed be
j fore the commission reached th/is
; "The demand of the journeymen tai
lors for a schedule of wages and
prices that shall be definite is an ab
solutely just demand."
During the long hearings before
the commission. Organizer Biggs of
the tailors charged that the employ
ers were forcing an "indirect lock
out" in violation of the law, hy send
ing their work out of the state. Writ
ing in the official magazine of the
Journeymen Tailors' union, he said:
"This new law and the industrial
commission of the state of Colorado
have stood like a si one wall acainst
the journeymen tailors of Denver and
a chance to better their conditions.
|No injunction, re-enforced by militia.
| could so effectually paralyze our ef
forts as has this new weapon, which
has worked out for industrial sup
pression, so far as the tailors are
concerned. Our members would stand
in line all day in a heavy rain to
wipe out. the law and the commission.
"The situation exasperates our
membership because they know that
the bosses are playing for time, hop
ing to ward the whole thing off till
dull season.
"We have appealed to the commis
sion and to the district attorney, and
find ourselves tied up with red tape.
If the merchant tailors had made the
law and the commission themselves,
they could not have done it much
better."
