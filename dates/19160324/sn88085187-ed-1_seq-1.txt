FOR PUBLIC WORKS JOB: WHO?
BY THE EDITOR.
In a series of talks on the city campaign I
have tried to make clear what sort of candidates
The Times would like to see elected—broad
minded, intelligent, fearless, up-building sort of
men.
Her. Stoever, who has neither program nor a
record of experience that fits him for public of
fice and who has consistently refused to commit
himself on any campaign issue, obviously is un
fit. The Times has recommended that his candi
dacy be disregarded by you voters.
On the other hand, P. H. Pettit by his experi
ence, conviction and character is so evidently
qualified for the public safety commissionership
that there should be no question of his being

This leaves the public works commissionership

There is some curiosity an to
the source of the money being
expended to give Astoria so
much publicity.
The convention at Spokane has
been called by the Columbia na
val luihc committee of Astoria,
and the same number of dele
gates are allotted to big cities
as to small towns in Washing
ton,' Oregon and Montana.
Surprise was expressed here
today that Astoria, Ore., should
seek a convention In Washing
ton.
It is charged that the plot Is
plainly to have a black eye cast
upon Bremerton in its own state
by packing the convention with
full delegations from small towns
in Oregon aud Montana, while
the people of Washington appar
ently are asleep at the switch.

dispatches today indicated that

It is believed a decisive action

The Teutons have succeeded
in bending the French front un
