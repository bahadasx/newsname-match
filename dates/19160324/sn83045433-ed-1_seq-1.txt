>i ,il (abi, to The Wa.kington Herad.
By F. NORGROVE COX.
The Vague, March :.-The destruction
of the Dutch liners Tubantla and Palem
hang has brought Dutch shipping almost
to a standstill.
The crew of the looer Nieuw Anster
dam. which cleared for New York, re
fused to sail yesterday. An East Indian
Mail steamer was also held back and
other big concerns followed suit. With
a population of G,000,000. Holland has
over 400 ocean-going vessels. Prom this
it will be realized what shipping staigna
tiom means to the Dutch nation.
It might appear to the casual observer
that the Dutch have taken the destruc
tion of the two big ships quietly. That is
not the case. There have been no wild
thieats nor war talk. bht ftgitr anger 1s
none the less deep and real.
The government Is straining every
nerve to find direct proofs with which to
confront the perpetrator of the outrages.
This Is to be done preferably by recover
ing the torpedo from the Tubantia. Ex
tensive diving operations are now In
progress.
Meanwhile the government is consider
ing the possibility of convoyIng Dutch
ships and of using mine sweepers.
It is significant of the feeling of the
country that not one paper of Rotterdam,
Amsterdam, or The Hague has attached
the slightest credence to the German
statements. The subject of reprisals has
been broached and is making rapid head
way.
