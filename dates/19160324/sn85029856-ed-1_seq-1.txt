WM. HOECKENDORF COMMITS
SUICIDE
William Hoeckendorf, a carpenter
and contractor of this city, commit
ted suicide by hanging Wednesday
about noon. The tragedy took place
in the basement of the home of Mr.
and Mrs. A. F. Gorman on North
Sherman avenue, which Mr. Hoeck
endorf had built and where he was at
-'work on the day it happened. Mr.
Hoeckendorf bad met with several
-financial reverses during the past
year or two, and it Is thought these
matters preyed on his mind until he
became slightly unbalanced with
the awful result noted. Mr. Hoeck
endorf was born In Germany on
March 23, 1870, and had he lived an
other day he would have been 46
years old. He filed on a claim near
Tyrone a number of years ago and
proved up on the same. He moved
to Liberal in 1907 and has been en
gaged In the contracting business
here ever since. He was a competent
-workman and many of the good
nomes in Liberal are tributes to his
skill. He leaves a wife and seven
children. He was a member of the
, Adventist church and his funeral will
le held by a prominent minister of
that denomiatlon next Sunday. No
definite funeral arrangements have
been made at this time but it is pre
sumed that burial will be made in
the Liberal cemetery. Mr. Hoeck-1
ndorf was a good citizen and his
untimely end will be greatly regret-
ted by the people of Liberal.

John W. Baughman and family re
turned Wednesday from a trip to
Chraeyi -Kansas.- wnw they went
last week to help celebrate the gol
den wedding anniversary of John's
parents. He also made a short busi
ness trip to Kansas City, where he
purchased a twelve-cylinder National

about as many automobiles in his
time as the writer has typewriters,
but can now consider himself a mem
ber of the big league. Here is his rec
ord of automobile purchases: Twelve
years ago he bought a 1-cylinder
Winton, later a 2-cylinder Rambler,
then a 4-cylinder Thomas Forty and
finally a Winton Six. He traded the
last-named car for an 8-cylinder Ap
person, which he sold recently, and
now looms up with a Twin-Six Na
tional, the only 1 2-cylinder car in
town. The new car is not only a
thing of beauty to behold but John
says he will bet any amount at odds
of 12 to 1 that It will go around any
thing in town like a train going from
a tramp.

THE PEOPLES STATE BANK
MADE OVER $215.00
The ladies of the Liberal Woman's
Club held their "tag day" Tuesday
sad came out over $215 to the good
on the day's work. They made their
headquarters at the Feather furni
ture store, and if anyone passed
there during the day without being
"bumped" for a donation we failed
to get his name. This money will
be expended for new books for their
library and ought to be enough to
lay in a very good supply. Incident
ally, some of Liberal's alleged busi
ness men should take a few lessons
in high finance fom the ladles who
Inaugurated and carried out this
scheme.
BET DATES FOR FAIR
The directors of the Southwest
Fair association met Monday even
ing and set the date for the fair to
be held this year. The date selected
was September 12, 13, 14 and 16.
Plans are already under way to
make the 1916 fair the biggest one
of all, which is saying quite a little,
as the ones held here In years gone
by have not been small affairs by any
means. The Southwest Fair is one
of the few that has ever come out to
the good financially. It panned out
about $1,000 above expenses last
year.
THE REVIVAL CLOSED. '
The revival has closed, the evan
gelist has gone, and so far as the
world is concerned all things will
soon return to their normal condi
tions, but to tbe -church It will be
somewhat different, for tbe enthusi
asm inspired by the service of the
last two weeks will long remain as
a vital force In its life and work, and
the families and . individuals who
have been most vitally affected by it
will long remember Brother Snlvely
and his faithful work here. '
The meeting was brief but the re
sults were very satisfactory to the
church. On March 19 the last dollar
of Indebtedness against the church
building was canceled and the notes
burned in tbe presence of the con
gregation. This is a source of great
satisfaction to us all as it Is the cul
mination of our hopes and the re
sults of four years of earnest effort
on the part of the members and
friends of the church.
The immediate and visible results
of the meeting are the addition of
thirty-one to the number of those
who stand for the best that this age
affords.
BIG FIRE NEAR KISMET
Sam Jones, a prominent 'farmer
living near Kismet, suffered a severe
loss by fire Tuesday night. Mr.
Jones lost hiB big new barn, machine
shed, cow shed, 5 wagons and several
thousand bushels of grain, besides
a big lot of roughness. Only by
heroic methods was the dwelling
saved, and it caught fire three dif
ferent times. The fire was caused
by a prairie fire which started near
Satanta and was swept to the Jones
farm by the strong wind. The loss
will amount to over $6,000, only a
small amount of which insurance
was carried on the buildings that
burned. There was no Insurance on
the feed stuff and Implements that
burned, nor on the grain. Some of
the fire fighters suffered severe burns
while battling the flames in an ef
fort to save the , residence. ,This
will prove a big loss to Mr. Jonei and
should serve as another warning that
you can't be too careful with fire at .
this time of year.
ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARTY
The Amoma Class of the Baptist
church entertained the Agoga class
at a jolly St. Patrick's Day party Fri
day evening, at the home of their
teachers, Mr. and Mrs. Rolo. There
were about thirty present. The even
ing was spent In playing many en
joyable St. Patrick games. There
were two contests that taxed the In
ventive powers of those participating.
At a late hour delicious refresh
ments, appropriate to the occasion,
were served, after which the guests
departed, all doclarlng that the of
ficial entertainers of the class, Miss
Olive Neff and Miss Ethel Cain, are
first-rate ones.

EIDSON GETS SECOND
H. H. Eidson of Liberal got sec
on prize in the Guymon auto race
Tuesday. Mr. Eidson drove the
same Buick Six that got first prize
in the Liberal race last month. The
distance covered was about 230
miles, but Homer got on the wrong
road at one point and went 36 miles
further than be should. Besides that
he got hung up on a "hog back," had
a puncture or two, and still came in
for second money. A party named
Plttman from Shattuck, Oklahoma,
got first money, making the trip in 6
hours and 12 minutes In a Buick Six,
and Rex Powelson of Hooker took
third in a Ford Goat. It was a bad
day for the race and several acci
dents were narrowly averted, but
much enthusiasm on the part of tbe
drivers and spectators Is reported,
nevertheless.
WILL WRITE t'P THE TOWN
Tom A Keene, special write-up
man for the Hutchinson Gazette, is
in town preparing the dope for a
write-up of Liberal In the Gazette.
This will appear in the issue of April
2, which Is Sunday, and will have a
big circulation. The Gazette makes
no charge for this kind of work, but
tbe fact that they have a circulation
of nearly 100 in the town of Liberal
Is good proof that tbe people appre
ciate such articles. Keene has been
in tbe Liberal hospital a couple of
weeks undergoing repairs as a result
of a nervous breakdown due to over
work, but is getting back in fighting
shape again and will be hitting the
ball in his usual strenuous manner in
a short time.
Mrs. J. R. Lyle left Saturday to
spend a week or two with relatives
and friends in Hutchinson.
