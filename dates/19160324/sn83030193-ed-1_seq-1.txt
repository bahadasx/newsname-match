SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March 24. Reports from Mexican

SYDNEY, New South Wales. March
"4. Lieut. Sir Krnest II. Shackleton
has returned fiom his antarctic ex
pedition. News of his achievements
Is withheld for tho present.
LONDON, March 24.-.V despatch
from Sydney says that the steam
ship Aurora of Lieut. Shackloton's
expedition, has broken from her
moorings at tho Host sea base, leav
ing most of tho party ashoro and
unable to embark. According to
these advices, Shackleton and his
companions will be compelled to i.
mam another year, before it will be
possible to rescue them.
lioss Se.i. named for the English
explorer, John I'oss, who discovered
It in IS!:1, Is between latitude 70 and
SO and is within the Antarctic circles.
The Shackleton b.ise probably is be
tween 1,500 and -',00o miles from New
Zealand. If Shackleton has reached
this base he has crossed the Antarctic
region to a point which Is perhaps
800 or l.Ooo miles beyond the South
Pole.
lteuter's Telegram Company states
that a wireless despatch lias been
received announcing that the Aurora
has gone adrift In the Antarctic Sea,
having broken from her mooring In
Itoss Sea while the party of ten men
wns on shore. This party consisted
of Lieut. Aeneas .Mackintosh, who Is
In charge of operations on the Alls,
trallan side, and nine members of his
staff. The.so ton men uiu thus left
on the shore.
The consequence is that If Lieut.
.Sbaekletoii has got through and
dossed the Antarctic continent there
Is no ship to meet him, and the whole
part.v will havo to temaln on the
shore of itoss Sea for another year.
The dispatch received In Iondon
from Sydney Indicates that tho point
at which Lieut. Shackleton had ar
rived, which was not brought out In
tho llrst announcement of his return,
wns at the Uoss sea base. Thero
the party was to have embarked on
thu Aurora to return to New Zealand,
whence tho Aurora set out.
The Aurora carried tho Second Sec
tion of tho expedition. Shackleton
starteil his voyage on the three
masted ship Endurance, built espe
cially for tho trip.
Tho Aurora, loaded with supplies.
It was arranged, was tu meet tho
Endurance on tho return trip and
tako Shackletun and his men to their
Journey's end.
Tho adventure of Lieut. Shackle
ton, heading tho lirltlsb trans-Antarctic
expedition, had a threefold pur
pose to navigate Antartleo. on a me
ridian; to secme for the British flag
the honor of being tho tlrst national
emblem thus to be taken from sea to
sea across this South Polar realm, and
to conduct scientific work relating,
among other phases, to metcurology,
geography and geodetic survey.
Tho expedition wns financed for the
most part by large gifts from persons
interested in polar exploration. Funds
amounting to more than 1300,000 were
raised, Including J50.000 from tho
British Government.

on the cost of construction, which was
to be in charge of the city's en
gineers. They spoke of asking 10 or
12 or 15 per cent, as their compensa
tion. Many large buildings were then
being built that way.
"The proposition appealed to me,
in view of the city's financial situa
tion. I introduced them to Mayor
Gaynor. They restated their proposi
tion, The Mayor listened, seemed to
understand it, and asked for my
opinion, I said that the law would
allow it, or, if not, legislation could
be obtained, and that the city would
own the roads. All that the gentlemen
asked was that their lien on the prop
erty should be the basis for bonds
they would issue.

Hi TO GEI THE ARSENIC
After Taking Drugs and Suffering
for Hours Dr. A. W. Waite Breaks
Down and Clears Up Mystery
of Millionaire's Death.
SUSPECT SAYS HE MAY
GO TO ELECTRIC CHAIR
V
Dr. Arthur Warren Waitc broke down late this afternoon and
practically confessed that he killed his father-in-law. John E.
Peck, the Grand Rapids millionaire.
"Mr. Peck," Waite told District Attorney Swann, -'wanted to
die. He told me he wanted to commit suicido and begged me to
get him some poison.
"I stood his pleadings as long as I could. Then I asked a Dr.
Muller where I could get some arsenic.
"He recommended me to a drug store on Lexington Avenue.
I bought the arsenic there, saying I wanted to kill a dog. I gave
the arsenic to Mr. Peck with the understanding that he was to
use it in killing himself."
Waite broke down rapidly as he was making his statement.
"I didn't put the arsenic in the soup or the tea," he declared.
"I gave it to Mr. Peck in an envelope.
"I didn't see him take the poison. All I know is that he
seemed grateful when I handed it to him.
"I know this is a weak story, Judge " said Waite, sobbing
and writhing, "but it's the truth. I know I can't prove it, and you
can send me to the electric chair, but it's the only story I can tell.

Arthur W.iiie purchased enough arsenic to kill half a dozen people on
March three days before his father-in-law, John H. Peck, the Grain!

and two detectives, started from the Criminal Courts Building in two
