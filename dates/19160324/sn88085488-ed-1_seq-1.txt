FARMERS SUFFER DAMAGE
' FROM CLOUDBURSTS AND RAIN
Several Farms Cut to Pieces by Deep
Tieiuiies —Fall Grain suffers—
IMillma ii Escapes Damage
Much damage was done to fall
grain and several farms east and
south of Pullman were literally cut
to pieces by the most severe rain
storm in the history of Whitman
county, which visited this section
Sunday evening. Several cloud
bursts were reported and the Pull
man merchants were thrown into a
frenzy of excitement when telephonic
reports were received here to the ef
fect that huge walls of water were
coming. These reports came from
the Chambers neighborhood and the
farmers just east of Pullman, where
the fury of the storm was most keen
ly felt. The merchants had their
forces of clerks busy within a few
minutes putting the stocks of goods
above the high water line, fearing
that a repetition of the disastrous
flood of early March in 1910 was
close at hand. Soon after 7:00
o'clock Dry Fork, running down
Grand street, began to swell, and at
7:30, the creek overflowed its banks,
the water forcing its way through the
board sidewalks in many places and
some water flowing down Main
street. The water soon spent its
fury, however, and the only damage
in the business district was collapsed
sidewalks on South Grand street,
where part of the bank caved in,
and a layer of mud on Grand and
Main streets.
The South Palouse, which caused
the damage in 1010, was but little
higher than a few weeks ago, and
at no time was there danger of it
overflowing its banks, although large
crowds of people wale lied patiently
for the creek to assert itself after
the excitement incident to the ram
page of Dry Fork had subsided.
Several farmers residing east of
Pullman suffered heavily through
destroyed fall sown wheat, deep
trenches, some as deep as three feet,
being washed from the tops of the
hills to the bottoms, and much soil
being washed down.
One of the most pretentious cloud
bursts incident to the storm oecuired
at the Edward Nagle farm, about
two miles east of Pullman. Mr.
N'agle was standing in the door ut
his barn during the heavy rainfall
when suddenly he heard a roaring
sound at the head of the narrow
gulch between his house and barn
and observed a wall of water 10 feet
deep rushing toward the bottom of
the gulch. The Nagle outbuildings
were inundated and the grain fields
resembled a series of European
trenches when the storm subsided.
Mr. Nagle states that the wall of
water passed in less than three min
utes and that just prior to the cloud
burst the rain fell in huge sheets. A
huge boulder in the nagle driveway,
at least three feet square, which was
deeply imbedded in the soil, and
which Mr. Nagle had been unable to
»ove with a team of draft horses,
was loosened from its bed and tossed
six feet up the side of the hill, as
though it had been but a feather.
Deep gullies were cut in the
George Farrand fields, just east of
the Nagle property, and when Mr.
farrand rescued his horses from the
am the water was up to their bel
*les. A large quantity of feed grain

one corner of the barn was washed
fom Its foundation. Damage to fall
B™n and fields is also ..ported by

■wd. and it Is probable that the
storm was at its height in this neigh
borhood. Huge piles o' mud were
washed onto the new county maead
*m road near Busbey warehouse,
nd tin cans, rocks and refuse made
""fie impossible until it was part
,y cleared away.
About 500 feet of track on the
UHman-Genesee branch of the

night. A small X. p. bridge at Fal
lon, eight miles north of Pullman,
was so badly damaged that no trains
were run over it until tin' following
afternoon.
The rain storm was preceded by
terrific claps of thunder and vivid
bolts of lightning, and was much
more severe in some places than oth
ers, Farmers residing near Cham
bers report that the water in the flat

EWARTSVILLE, Wash.. March
23. — Tin' worst rain storm in the
history of the Ewartsvllle count
came last Sunday evening between
6:00 and 7:00 o'clock, the heavy
rain being accompanied by thunder
and lightning. The rain fell in tor
rents and a great deal 'of damage
was done to fences and to the fields,
A log house, belonging to R. B. Hat
ley, that had stood for 30 years and
was an old landmark, was washed
away, as well as several other small
buildings. Union Flat creek was
higher than it had been previously

of Sunday evening, and it is estimat
ed that the total damage there, in

to $10,000. A cloudburst between
the Ed. Ryan farm and the old Bur

the canyon, and every fruit farm in
its path Buffered considerable dam

age was done on the William Batty

from the river, where nearly 101
fruit trees were uprooted and loin
outbuildings, including the black
smith shop, chicken house and gran
ary, were carried away. The loss at
this place is estimated at $2000. At
the Thomas Batty, fruit farm, farthei
up the canyon, several trees were
uprooted and other damage was

Pullman Boosters in Busy Session
<'. 1,. MacKenzie of Colfax Made an
Earnest Plea for Haul Surfaced
I toads
There was a large attendance at
the Chamber of Commerce luncheon
last Tuesday and considerable busi
ness was discussed and transacted.
C. 1,. MacKenzie, the Colfax banker,
was present and made an earnest
plea for hard surfacing the new state
aid highway between Pullman and
Colfax. He argued that the near
ness of water to the surface of
Spring Hat will make it impossible
to build a road of crushed rock or
gravel which will stand traffic dur
ing the entire year and asserted that
two miles of the road follows the
old creek channel ami will always
tie' giving trouble unless it is hard
surfaced, lie quoted figures tc
show that a 12-foot highway with a
concrete base and asphaltic covering
could be- constructed at a cost ol
10,000 per mile and maintained
that in the' end it would be cheapej
than the initial cost ami constant re
pairs ol' a graveled highway. He
argued that this road between Pull
man and Colfax will be the most im
portant and most traveled stretch ol
highway in the county and should
be made the best. The oil and
water bound macadam roads which
the county has been building have
not given value for the' money they
cost, but have been beneficial as an
experiment, demonstrating what
kind of roads ought not to be con
structed. Tin' ability of roads with
a concrete base' to stand up under all
conditions and at all times has been
conclusive!) demonstrated. What
the farmers want is a road to theli
market which can be used every houi
of every day of the year. He argued
that it is better to build a few miles
of this kind of highway each yeat
than to construct more miles of an
inferior highway which soon wears

a man would have to be employed to
give half his time to supervising the
work. This would entail an expense'

the school district is unable to ap

be raised in some way he thought
it best to drop the matter for this
