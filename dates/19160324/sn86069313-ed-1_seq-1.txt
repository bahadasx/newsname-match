VILLA JOINED BY
CARRANZA TROOPS
2,000 MEN UNDER GEN. LUIS'!
HERRERA DESERTS, IS
REPORT.
SITUATION IS SERIOUS
Grave Dissatisfaction Among All Tho
Regular Mexican Troops On
h Tho Border.
r Columbus, March 22. (passed by
t censor.) General Luis Herrcra, un
" til recently tho Carranza military
governor of Chihuahua, has re
nounced Carranza nnd announced
himself In favor of Vllla.and is tak
ing the field In western Chihuahua
-with 2,000 troops, according to re
liable information received here to
night. The exact placo at which General
Herrera's troops aro encamped is
n,ot Indicated In tho message which
reached Columbus from a source
that always has been found reliable.
It is believed, however, that the
troops, most of whom recently con
situated tho Carranza garrison at
Chihuahua City tonight are at some
place botween the San Pedro and
Chihuahua and aro preparing to
work north and west toward the
American punitive expedition in the
field under GoneraJ Pershing.
Sentiment For Villa., ,
Tho sentiment of tho peoplo in
this district, which lies about seventy
miles directly east of tho Guerrero
region in which Villa began his days
, as an outlaw, is strongly in favor of
the bandit chieftain. His success In
withstanding Forflrlo Diaz', rurales
for eight years during all of which
' time there -was a-heavyprlce on his
head was due to tho "loyalty of the
peons. Army men believe hero Her
rera and his command will havo ev
ery possible co-operation from tho
people of the district.
Important Development.
Tho report marks nn Important
development In the American cam
paign to capture Villa, according to
experienced observers of Mexican
military affairs. It Is pointed out the
reported renunciation of, the Car
ranza. standard by Herrera Is the
first made by an Important military
leader of tho defacto government
since tho American troops crossed
the International lino. The possible
effect upon tho other Carranza lead
ers, who havo been reported waver
ing in their loyalty to tho govern
ment of tho "first chief" Is fpod for
much discussion.
El Paso, March 22. Silence,--which
for two days has enveloped
the Mexican situation as far as any
definite news of tho pursuit of Villa
was concerned, gavo fresh force to
day to numerous reports from vari
ous sources of theravo disaffection
among the Carranza trops.
On tho border at least it Is firmly
believed tho first chief's soldiers
aro far from giving any real co-operation
to tho American expedition
ary force. ,
Andres Garcia, tho Carranza con
sul here, branded as falso the report
that Herrera with 2,000 troops had
gone over to Villa, but In high offi
cial circles It Is regarded at least pos
sible. Since yesterday morning General
Gavlra, tho commander at Juarez,
claimed tho wires along tho Mexican
& (Northwestern railroad, from
Juarez to Casas Grandes had been
cut, nnd consequently could not
givo out any Information In regard
to the reported battle at Namlqulpa,
but the Americans here, especially
tho refugees from Mexico are frank
ly skeptical both as to tho reported
battle, and cut "wires.

AMBITION CAUSE
OF VILLA'S FATE
GEN. ANGELES TELLS WHY FOR
MER LEADER HAS BECOME
HUNTED BANDIT.
SOUGHT TO BE DICTATOR
Power of The Once Famous General
Began to Wane When Advis
ers Were Estranged.
n
El Paso, Tex., March 21. Gen.
Felipe Angeles, often referred to as
the "True patriot ot the Mexican rev
olution," and former chief military
adviser to Francisco Villa, today
came out of a long retirement to ex
plain how, in his opinion, Francisco
Villa, Instead of being leader of the
Constitutionalist cause, has fallen to
the status of a hunted bandit.
General Angeles charged that "Vil
la, like Carranza, aspired to be a dic
tator," and that this, and not the
battles he lost, caused his trends to
forsake him.
The General was 'the last of Vil
la's prominent supporters to quit
him. He now lives on a modest
vegetable and dairy farm, four miles
beyond the eastern outskirts of El
Paso.
Half a mile distant flows the Rio
Grande. From his front porch he
can look across Into the Mexican ter
ritory, which he is at present forbid
den to enter.
"The Carranzlstas, the Villastls
and the Zapatlsts are all my ene
mies," said the General, his young
son acting as Interpreter, "and I
chose this place for my home so that
they may know that I fear none of
them. I till my soil and herd my
cows, having definitely put aside war
and politics. I am not guarded; any
one who wishes can cross the river
and molest me."
Tribute to Villa.
Before beginning the Interview
General Angeles said that he regret
ted the difficulties into which Villa
had fallen. He said that he had a
warm remembrance ot the man as a
comrade in arms, and explained he
had been drawn to support him be
cause Villa had seemed-at the time
to represent the cause of real de
mocracy. He said he only left him
when be found Villa did not under
stand democracy, although he did for
the cause all that he knew how to
do.
Discussing the causes of Villa's
rise In the army, General Angeles
said:
"Villa gained power because ot his
wonderful energy and his personal
magnetism. He had driving power.
Also he could be free and gener
ous. "There seemed to be an Impression
that Villa assured obedience by In
spiring fear. This is unjust."
Going on the next phase ot the
former Constitutionalist leader's car
reer, the General said:
Cause of Downfall
Th prmary reason for Villa's
"The' turning point In Villa's ca
reor came with tho battle of Celaya
in March, 1915. This engagement,
ono ot the most Important ot the rev
olution, exposed his detects as a gen
oral. Villa went into this battle
with tho most meager supply of am-
rhe Tad no ammunition. Yet
111 (LI. 111a. iUtx Aval
, ,..,,
'he ordered his men to advance
again.
"Before Villa marched from Mon
terey to attack General Obregon's
forces I volunteered to go with him.
Unfortunately I was thrown from a
horse and my toot was crushed.
"I begged him not to take the of
fensive until he had obtained suffi
cient ammunition Confldont that
the enemy were frightened by the
prestige ho had gained in previous"
battles, he ignored my pleas,
Cnrranza's Victory.
"It Is a solemn fact that Villa's"
forces went into the battle of Celaya
wlthout orders. The better organiz
ed and better supplied Carranzlstds,
seeing that his ammunition was ex--hSusted,
rallied from his first attack
and defeated him. He had inadff ac
preparations for possible repulse and
his force was completely discourag
ed. This was the beginning of th
end." General Angeles declared that,not
withstanding the recent trend of
events, the cause of democracy bad
not lost prestige in Mexico.
"I only regret," ho added, "that
the cause was represented by suck -man
as Villa." r.
The General said it was altogether
likely that the hunted bandit would
elude his pursuers.
General Angeles Is a graduate ot
tho famous Mexican military school
ot Chapultepec. He possesses 8 Ua
reputation as a military man, pftf"
tlcularly In his specialty, artillery.
Along the border and among mtnf
government officials it Is often said
that the General's strategy, freely"
given to Villa, won -the long list off
military successes tor which Villa
was given credit. General Angeles
modestly refuses to acknowledge'
this.
