Both of them died in -Or. Waite's

The district : attorney claimed he

charged, Walte obtained arsenic two
weeks ago. Peck died March 12.
Swann thinks the inference is ob
vious. Swann's theory of motive was that
Dr. Watte neodod ready cash; He
alleged the doctor was living lavish
ly, although he had no visible moans
of support.
A book dealing with poisons was
found by Swaun In the accused phy

Swann changed his plans suddenly
and doodled not to move Dr. Walte
