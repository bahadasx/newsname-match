DEATH OF BENJ. TITUS v
Another of Lordsburg's
"pioneers has answered the call
of the Grim Reaper. Benjamin
Titus, for twenty years manager
of the Binn Lumber Company
here, Director of the Arizona
Eastern Railroad and first Grand
Master of the Masonic lodge in
Arizona, died in the Ladies' Hos
pital at Deming following a
stroke of paralysis. Mr. Titus'
many friend throughout the
Southwest were grieved to hear
of his death as many believed the
aged man to be in fit condition
to brave life for several more
years.
The account of his death
follows
Following a severe stroke of
paralysis while attending the
grand lodge of Masons at Tucson
last week, Benjamin F. Titus pass
ed away in the Ladies Hospital at
Derning at nine o'clock on Satur
day night, aged 73 years. Mr. Ti
tus came to Lordsburg thirty years
ago as manager of the Binn Lum
ber Company, later buying out
that business for himself, and
managing it for a number of years.
He was interested in the Copper
Queen and other well known min
ing properties in Arizona, and a
a great part of his wealth was de
rived from these sources. He was
also a director in the Southern
Pacific Railway, the Arizona East
ern railway and the First Nation
al Bank of El Paso, and a con
servative estimate places the value
of his estate between $75,0000 and
$100,000, all of which is left to one
brother back in New York.
Mr. Titus was the first grand
master of the A. F. & A. M. in Ari
zona and always took a deep and
active interest in the work of the
order in that state and in New
Mexico.
With a premonition that his end
would not be long delayed, Mr. Ti
tus recently made arrangements
for the disposition of his remains
when the call did come for him,
and immediately after his death
his body was prepared for burial
by J. A. Mahoney, Inc., and was
shipped back to Huntington, Long
Island, N. Y., for interment in the
family burying ground. Two bro
thers,. John E. and Joseph Titus,
survive htm, both residents of the
state of New York.

ROAD WORK DONE1
The Grant County road workers
have completed the new Border
land Route, going directly west
from Lordsburg across the Ani
mas lake into Steins, and thence
to Rodeo, following the ridge road
off one mile this side of Steins.
The new road is one of the best in
Grant county and is at present be
ing heavily traveled by autoists
to and from points in Arizona.' A
high and dry grade was built over
the lake and will be an "all the
year round" highway. A short dis
tance from Steins a good cut-off
connects the new road with the
Granite Gap road and thence in
connection with the old Border
land route.
The road workers have made an
excellent job of the new road pro
tect and the people of Arizona who
have been demanding good roads
in this section should now give
Grant County credit for its efforts.
. WORK ON DUNCAN ROAD
The road gang left Wednesday
morning to begin work on the road
between Lordsburg and Duncan.
A survey is now being made and
as soon as more prisoners arrive
actual work will begin in making
this one of the best roads out of
Lordsburg.
A good grade will be built, cul
verts will be put in and every
effort will be made to construct a
highway that will last for many
years.
BELIEVED CATTLE STOLEN
Constable Oscar Allen, Sam Fos
ter, William Brooks and J. T. Reed
of Duncan made a thorough scour
,of this section of the country Mon
day looking for five horses which
were missed Sunday night from
the Lazy B ranch and which were
believed to have been stolen by
Mexicans orothers in the section.
The coterie motored to Rodeo, San

MINES AND MINING
SELLS TUNGSTEN rROERTY
One of the most important min
ing transactions of the past few
months was culminated here 'on
Tuesday when Dr. M. M. Crocksr
sold his tungsten property at the
Victoria Mining district near Gage,
N. M., to the Nevada Hills Mining
Company, represented by Charles
Starr ,who will have charge of the
future operations of the mines. It
is understood that the considera
tion received for the property was
in the neighborhood of $15,000.
The property sold consisted of
eight claims-located by Dr. M. M.
Crocker four years ago. In the ear
ly nineties the property was work
ed for the silver contents of the
ore, but later tungsten was dis
covered on the property. The
claims are developed by two shafts
one 130 feet deep and the other
90 feet deep. At the 40 foot level
a drift has been run, developing
the main vein, which is about
twenty feet wide. The lead is in
a lime formation, with quartz gan
gue enclosing the tungsten. Ship
ments mde by Dr. Crocker show
a content of about 60 per cent
tungstic acid in the ore.
The mines have been examined
by some of the world's best author-,
ities on tungsten and all pronounce
it as one of the best properties in
the west.
The new owners plan extensive
development work, to begin at
once, and a treatment plant will be
erected to mill the ore.
Attorney Hayworth of Prescott,
Ariz., accompanied Mr. Starr here
to close the transfer of the proper
ty. The Bonney Mining Company
this week received a No. 7 Cameron
pump, which will be installed in
the" No. 3 shaft at once, and kall
expedience made in unwatering
that part of the famous Bonney
claims.
CAR RETURNS BIG
J. L. Wells has received returns
on thirty-five tons of ore shipped
from the San Bra no lease on the
property of the Bonney Mining
Company, netting $1,021.00. ,
W. H. Stevenson, of Silver City,
arrived here on Monday to accept
a position with the Bonney mine.
Mr. Stevenson is one of the old
time mine operators of the Carlisle,
Pinos Altos and Santa Rita dis
tricts. ARIZONA DAY HERE

False Reports
Following, the Liberal is pub
lishing an article appearing in
the Los Anéeles Examiner
of Marcha 17th on the second
page, dealing with a " wild
attack on Lordsburg," a most
inconsistent and outrageous in
sult to the people of this city and
revealing stupendous ignorance
on the part of the publishers of
the article. How the Santa Fe
got its shops at Lordsburg and
how six thousand idle Mexicans
went on a strike months after all
strikes had been settled will ever
be a mystery that only the Ex
aminer can solve.
The disgusting piece follows:
Threats to Rob Bank, Burn
Homes and Kill All Gringos Re
ported From Lordsburg, N. M.
Reports of disorders have come
from numerous border points.
The women and children in the
district northeast of Hachita have
been concentrated at Lordsburg,
M. M., and Kave taken shelter
in the Santa Fe Railroad round-1
house. The district is being ter
rorized by Mexicans who, until
recently, worked in the mines of
that district.
They are said to have threatned
to burn all homes, loot the bank
of Lordsburg and kill every grin
go they can catch, in resentment
over the invasion.
Just north of Lordsburg there
are said to be six thousand idle
Mexican miners on a labor strike.
The sheriff at Silver City is
swearing in every man in that
section-as a deputy,
Manager A. J. Interrieden of
the 85 mine has received a copy
of the Chicago American of the
16th instant, with a front page
scare head and a paragraph tell
of "threats to loot the town and
kill all Americans." The Liberal
has it on display for those who
care to stand the shock.
ARREST VILLA MEN
Several recruiting officers of the
Villa band were arrested in Clif
ton the first of the week.
INVASION NEWS
Complete accounts of the Mex
ico invasion will be found on

SOCIAL EVENTS
St Patrick '8 Day " in the eve
nin' " was very appropriately
celebrated by a large crowd of
both old and young of Lordsburg
at the Hunter Ranch eight miles
west of Lordsburg Friday eve
ning, where Miss Rachael Robson
was the charming hostess of a
most delightful party. About
ten automotyle loads of guests
motored out to the Hunter Ranch
early in the evening, returning
at midnight. The evening was
perfect and the partyone which
every person heartily enjoyed.
Games were played and a musi
cal program rendered by some of
Lordsburg's best talent. Re
freshments consisting of sand
wiches, pickles, cake and coffee
were served on appropriately de
corated plates. Punch was also
served during the evening. The
Hunter home was. beautifully de
corated in green with genuine
imported Shamrock spragues to
delight those of the "old sod"
who were present.
The guests all voted Miss Rob
son a delightful hostess and all
were more than pleased at the
success of the party.
A delightful surprise party was
given Monday evening in honor of
Mrs. McClure and family, who will
leave for Tucson. Over twenty
five guests were in attendance,
each furnishing a part of the co
pious refreshments. A most en
joyable time was had by every one
who attended the affair.
Money Makes Money. Circulate
It. Keep It Moving Pay-Up Week
HOW often docs one hear the expression, "Business is all right,
but collections are bad."
Make collections good. There's no better way to make
them good than to pay up your debts. Promptness in paying debts
makes for a better community ail around. The merchant will ap
preciate a prompt settlement of that small amount due him. If
he gets quick cash for his sales he'll put in a belter stock of goods.
He'll be satisfied with a smaller profit. When a man is selling an
article and he knows he has a long time to wait for his cash he is
likely to ask a little more than he would if he knew that his money
soon would be forthcoming.
IF PAY-UP WEEK IS MADE THE MOST OF THE STATEMENT
THAT COLLECTIONS ARE BAD WILL BECOME OBSOLETE. EV
ERY ONE WILL HASTEN TO PAY HIS DEBTS. IT IS PERFECTLY
PLAIN THAT, WITH EVERY ONE PAYING UP, THE COMMUNITY
WILL BE BETTER OFF. THERE WILL BE MORE MONEY IN CIR
CULATION. IT WILL NOT BE TIED UP. MONEY MAKES MONEY.
CIRCULATE IT. KEEP IT MOVING.
This town is isiirc of n groat awakening if Pay-Up Week is en
tered in tho right spirit. The exchanging of caxh makes for pros
perity. When tho employer pays the employee, the employee pays
the grocer, the butcher, the baker. The grocer, the butcher, the
baker, in turn circulate the money in town.. Ready cash is a won
derful business stimulant. Help this town along. If heretofore
you,have been tardy in tho payment of your obligations make a new
resolve. Pay promptly.
This appeal is made also to those who do pay promptly. If
you have fixed a certain time to pay a certain bill during or after
Pay-Up Week arrange it so that you can meet this obligation Pay
Up Week. Let the How and interchange of cash bo incessant dur
ing this week.
MAKE PAY-UP WEEK THE-SPLENDID SUCCESS IT DESERVES
TO BE.
