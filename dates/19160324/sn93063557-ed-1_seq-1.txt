A delightful feature of dio evening
wns tho singing of Miss Jessio Fulling-
ton, who hails from Cambridge, Vt., nnd
is rnpidly making her wny as u singer
in Hrooklyn. Miss Fullington has a
clear, pleasing voice, which sho controls
quite remarknbly for so young n singer.
Her onunciation is excellentand sho has
the promise of that peculiar hold upon
her nudience which gives one renl auc
cess in singing.
Perhnps the most interesting feature
of the evening was a lottor read by
Presid.'iit Twitcholl from formor Sona-
tor George F. Edmunds. Mr. Edmunds
does not hesitate to deal with presont
queations and his words have something
of the strongfeelingnow currentamong
Vermonters and good citizons all over
tlie country as to recent events in con
ni'Ction with the war. Ilore is the
letter:-
My dkak Mit. Twitciikm. :
I have vours nnd am deenly gruteful
for the great honor tho Socioty pro-
poses . Aias, 1 am less auie lo acccpt
tnan one year ago. i snouui rejoice,
were it possible, to express to my
hrother Vermonters how the awful
hon ors occurring in Europo have im
pressed me, and mv grief that our
country as a nation did not express on
the first invasion ol Bolgium our just
indignation at the barbarous conduct of
the Oermnn armies justiliod and contin
ued in ono form or nnother to this dnte.
The laws nnd duties of Christiun hu
manity are far higher than tho needs of
trade or nmbitions for political .cxpan
sion. I think we have greviously failed
in publicly expivssing these convictions
whatcver may have been the conse
ciuences of so doing.
I wish for your Socioty every felicity
at your meeting nnd after.
Very sincerely yours,
Gkouge F. Edmunds.
