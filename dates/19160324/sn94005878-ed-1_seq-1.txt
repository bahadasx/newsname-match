Villa Expected German Aid.
"Villa only talked to me twice." Mrs
Wright said. "1 avoided talking with
him because he would have thought I
admired him and would have forced
me to accompany him. He told his
officers how he would wipe out the
town of Columbus and when the Unit

AS IDOL OF PEONS
Villa's Audacity Wins Him Sym
pathy Among the Ignorant
Mexicans.
Villa's audacity 'n making such a
bold attack on American soil and bis
escspe from the smsll mounted forces
thst pursued blm from Columbus has
done much toward placing him back
on bis pedestal as ths popular Idol of
the peons and Ignorant Mexicans
The American Invasion hss given
blm the srgument that Carranza Is In
league with the "gringos" and the dec
laration that plsns sre on foot to
place the states of Chthuahus snd
Sonora under American rule, after
the example of Texas and California
In all public statements since the
Columbus massacre. Carranza has
carefully avoided reference to the
American Invasion, of which he has
received both personal and official In
formation.
In El I'aso, It Is taken for granted
that the "gringo bato" so carefully
cultivated In Mexico for the last sixty
vears. Is now so strong that Carranza
would loso all prestige If he rcrog
nizod an Invasion by the despised men
of the North, whether that invasion
was under tho name of "punitive ex
pedition" or any other Innocent ap
pearirg phrase. '
It Is believed the f uneral plan of In
vasion of Mexico under consideration
by the American forces is laid along
three avenues of entrance. According
to this theory, one. United States col
umn will enter Mexico through Juarez
another from Douglas, Ariz., and a
third will start from tho blackened
ruins of Columbus.
The theory Is based on the belief
that the war department has decided
to take measures by which it hopes to
throw a line of forces midway east
and west across the state of Chihua
hua, thereby cutting Villa off from
further recruiting his forces In the
central part of the republic.
With this line on the south tho
Douglas column on the west and the
Juarez column on the east. It is be
lieved Vllls will bo cornered In a "V."
the tips of which will touch the Inter
national border line.
Then by the closing of this cordon
and the starting of the third expedí
tlonary force on a straight sweep
south from Columbus, It Is believed
that the bandit chieftain and his forces
will be surrounded and forced Into a
decisive battle. InEtead of an endlesp
period of guerrilla warfare In the
hills.
The cordon would further hive the
effect of atsrvlng out Villa and hit
'ol lowers snd Isolating them from all
communications with potentiut assist
ance In other parts of the republic
The success of the plan Is admitted
to depend largely upon the ability ol
the American forces to overcome the
ever spreading Carranza opposition
which Is now being considered one ol
the strongest factors in the campaign
With the pitifully small forces avail
able at present. It Is believed the
mertcan forces will experience great
difficulty in covering the SO.Ouu or
more square miles In the prescribed
area of the "U," and at the same time
protecting their lines of communica
tlon. both from the onslaughts of tin
entrapped bandits and the hostile die
nop'tlon of the Csrranzlstas
The last Is a negligible quantity by
no means. Mexicans sre Mexicans
first and Carranzlstas second. As Car
ranzistas they hale Villa but as Mexl
ans tbey solidly hate Americans.

to the Mexican peovle:
"In order to reosov any apprehea

United Mutes or Mexico, the Presi
dent hss authorized me to give in bis
name the public assurance that the

"On the contrary, wbst now Is being
done Is deliUrati ly Intended to pre
elude the possibility of Intervention."
United States Concedes Right
Following is the answer of the
United 8tates to the Carranza nota
suggesting a reciprocity agreement In
the matter of troops from each gov
ernment crossing the boundary line In
pursuit of bandits, sent to Carranza
through Consul Sllllman at Guadala
Jara:
"You are Instructed to reply as fol
lows to Secretary Acunas note of
March 10:
"The government of the United
States has received the courteous note
of Señor Acuna and has read with sat
isfaction his suggestion for reciprocal
privileges to the American and Mex
lean authorities In the pursuit and ap
prehension of outlaws who Infest
their respective territory along the
international boundary, and who are
a menure to tlio lives uud property of
residents In that region.
"Tho government of the t'nited
States, In view of affairs whh'h have
existed for some time along the Inter
nut tonal boundary, and earnestly de
siring to cooperate with the de facto
government ot Mexico to suppress this
state of lawlessness of which the re
cent attack on Columbus, N M , is a
deplorable example, and to insure
peace and order in the regions con
tiguous to the boundary between the
two republics, readily grants perniis
slon for military for of the de facto
government of Mexico to crons th-
International boundary In pursuit of
lawless bunds ot armed men who have
entered Mexico from the United
States, committed outrages on Mexi
can soil and fled Into the United
States, on the understanding that the
de facto government of Mexico gtsnts
the reciprocal privilege that the mill
tary forces of tho United States may
pursue across the International bou 11
dary Into Mexican territory lawless
bi'.nds of armed men who l ave en
tered the United States from Mexico,
committed outrages on Ameritan soil
and fled Into Mexico.
"Tho government of the Unitej
States understands that In view of its
Idea of the reciprocal arrangement
proposed by the do fucto government
tho arm is now complete and in force
and the reciprocal privilege thereunder
may accordingly bo exercised by
either government without further In
terchange of views.
"It Is a matter o great satisfaction
to the government of the United
Stntes that the do facto government
has been so friendly In the mnt'er of
cooperation with the United States to
apprehend and punish the bands of
outlaws who seek refuge bevond the
International boundaries In the erro
neous belief that constituted authori
ties will resent any pursuit across the

tho crimes of the fugitives.
"With thp same spirit of cordial
