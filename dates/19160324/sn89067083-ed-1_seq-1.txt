Newspapers and preaohers
often have quite a problem in the
wording of obituaries and funeral
sermon, but a Warrensburg
negro preaoher decided to tell the
whole truth over the body of
Willis Banks who was killed by
falling from a train. The preaoh
er said he had been told that
Banks was a gambler, a oonviot,
that he stole from his mother and
that he had violated every law
of God and man: and if these
things were true, Banks' soul
was now sizzling in hell's fire
whioh was 100.000 times hotter
than any ordinary fire. And
now his dusky congregation are
all sore at the preacher and it is
a safe bet no more sorrowing
relatives will call on him to
