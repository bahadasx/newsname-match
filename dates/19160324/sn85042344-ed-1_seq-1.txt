"and with Rood reason. For thirty or

Funston' Instructed him to investigate
the report and inform him of the de

COU'MlsrS, X. Mex.. March 23.
Lieutenant Edgar S. Gorrell, of
the United States nerlal corps, who
has been missing since last Sunday,
wus found today threo miles south of
Ascenclon by a motor truck train un
der Lieutenant J. L. Parkinson,
Twentieth Infantry, according to re
ports made tonight to military head
quarters here. Lieutenant Gorrell was
uninjured but was out of gasoline and
had lost his way.
Lieutenant Gorrell had been alone
for fortv-elght hours In tho middle of
a sand-swept, uninhabited plateau on
the borders of Ijike Frederlco, but
suffered only slightly from exposure
to the sun. I lis plane was intact. With
the receipt of today's reports all of
the eight armv planes which left here
last Sunday to fly to Casas Orandes
have been accounted for.
I'lycr Ixiscs Ills Way.
The fiver said that shortly after the
start he lost sight of the other planes
and mlspcd his way. After flying for
miles over the surrounding country In
an effort to determine his where
abouts he was forced to alight on tho
plateau because of u leaking fuel
tank. The gasoline oozed away and
ho was unable to find the leak In the
darkness.
There were no signs of human habi
tation and no vegetation on the
height except burned clumps of bunch
grass. He finally made his way to a
recently abandoned American camp
ing place on the wagon trail about six
miles southeast. There ho placed a
note telling of his whereabouts and
condition on a stick , which he. drove
firmly in the ground near the trail.
Heing unwilling to leave his plane un
til protected he made his way back
to the lake with the realization that
if he attempted to find a village he
porbably would wander in the hills at
the risk of , encountering bandits or
wild animals. He said he was confi
dent thnt his note would be found
before his supply of three day's ra
tions gave out.
To CaHMS (ranitcN
When he was rescued he had been
without food for 24 hours and Raid
that he had about determined to at
tempt to find succor. '
Aboard the trucks which rescued
him were several barrels 'of gasoline
and with the aid of some tools ob
talned from the truckmen. Lleuten
ant Gorrell soldered his tank and rose
in a f lht which he predicted would
end In Casas Grandes tn on hour. He
left the earth with a wave of the hand
to the soldiers on the truck train as
he shouted "I'll get there this time,
boys."

Al'Gl'STA, Gu.. March 23. With
six business blocks devastated'
by fire and more than six hundred
dwelling houses destroyed, Including
residences that had been the pride of
this old southern city, Augusta to
night was feeding and housing its
three thousand homeless without ask
ing aid from the outside world.
Late today a local committee had
raised' $15,000 to feed and provide
shelter for the homeless. It was an
nounced that (50,000 would be sub
scribed here and thut outside aid
would not be needed.
Estimates of the file loss remained
at (5,000,000 tonight, but citizens who
discussed the disaster expressed the
view that the loss of one hundred and
thirty business houses was not felt
more than was the destruction of his
toric buildings. St. Haul's Episcopal
church, erected 135 years ago, fell be
fore the flames. Homes of colonial
style that had withstood the ravages
of (he war between the states were
In the fire's path and their seasoned
timbers were quickly consumed.
Work was begun today to restore
conditions to normal and laborers
began to dynamite walls in the down
town section which might endanger
lives. Telephone and lighting serv
ice also was being restored tonight.
The cause of the fire was not de
termined today. No lives were lost,
but thrre were scores of narrow es
capes and a dozen or more persons
were slightly hurt. Four firemen
remained in hospitals tonight but
none was seriously injured.

Doctor Js Found-in His Of

AN ESTATE OF $1,500,000
Poisoned Wealthv Fatlier-
in-Iiavv to (Jet His rr
tune, Charged.
NEW YORK. March 23. In a
stupor from self-administered
drugs, Dr. Arthur Warren Waite. a
dentist and well known as a tennis
player, was in the custody of detec
tives tonight anil will be charged with
the murder here on March 12 of his
lather-in-luw, John E. Peck, a mil
lionaire drug manufacturer of Grand
Rapids, Mich., as soon as he can be
taken into court. With the arrest of
Doctor Waite the district attorney's
office believes It has uncovered what
will prove one of the most sensational
cases In many years.
Mr. Peck, who is reputed to have
left an estate valued at about $1,500,
000, and his wif died within six
weeks while visiting their daughter
and her husband at their Riverside
apartments here. Hy the will of Mr.
Peck, his estate was equally divided
between Mrs. Walto and Percy Peck
of Grand Rapids, his son. Mrs. Wuite
now Is seriously ill at Grand Rapids.
District Attorney Swann said today he
had learned today she hud been In
structed by Waite to make a will In
his favor.
Hail Taken Poison.
When detectives went to the Waite
apartment today they found tho
young dentist In bed. apparently In
great pain. Dr. A. A. Moore, the
physician who attended Peck while
he waS here, declared Waite was suf
fering from overdoses of narcotics.
Considerable quantities of three dif
ferent drugs were found In the den
tist's clothing and he said he had
taken some of each kyid, beginning
yesterday morning. Asked how much
he had taken, he replied "plenty."
District Attorney Swann went to
the house with a stenographer to
take a statement from the dentist,
but Waite was In a stupor. Dr. Mooro
said his patient probably would bo
able to go to court tomorrow. In the
meantime Waite will be closely
guarded.
Placed in Tombs.
The arrest of Doctor Waite was or
dered todav after an investigation by
District Attorney Swann - based upon
the results of an autopsy on Peck's
body, which revealed strong symp
toms of poisoning. The case was
pluced in the hands of the grand Jury
today after Dora Heller, a negro maid
at Doctor Walte's home, and Dr. Jacob
B. Cornell, a wealthy relative of the
Peck's, had told stories to the district
attorney which seemed to him
to warrant beginning proceedings
against the dentist.
The grand Jury Investigation will
continue several days. Meunwhile
Waite will be taken to the Tombs and
held without ball charged with mur
der in the first degree, the district at
torney said.

OSTRICH EGGS IN
VAULT OF A BANK
Came From Sand Springs
Zoo; Will Incubate
Them Later on.
Egus ure very queer things to keep
In a bank vuult. Sometimes In the
snowy seif son, however, their mone
tary value is such that they may bo
reckoned as ready cash at something
like 2 14 to 3 cents per egg. Ordin
arily their importance Is no more than
to find a place of repose In the buck
porch refrigerator.
Yet at this time, with "fresh coun
try eggs" tumbling in price, there arc
a couple of eggs slowed away safely
and securely In the vault of I lie Sand
Springs State bunk. This peculiar
place for eggs is not merely for the
real money value of them, but it is as
much for the welfare of the eggs as
uiiytbing else that, they are there a
cool, even temperature In a dark
place.
A little later on in the season these
two eggs and there muy ho others
by that time will be Incubated. Tho
ordinary Incubator of commerce won't
do. either. It will have to bo a special
machine. An old hen couldn't do the
Job very well, because these eggs
weigh respectively two pounds seven
ounces and Iwo pounds nine ounces.
Yes. they are ostrich eggs. They
were laid bv one of the "l.en" os
triches out in the ostrich pens at
Sand Springs' park zoo, and right now
these eggs ure receiving more atten
tion than the ostriches ere. Every
precaution is being taken with them,
for It Is expectd that within a few
weeks' time there will be little ostrich
es picking their way through the
tough shells. Just how they ure go
ing to) be Incubated Is worrying the
keeper of the zoo, and some advice
will likely be gotten along this lino
from some of the larger zoos of the
coui.try. In their natural life It Is
said that the turtle ottrich takes turn
about with the sun In causing the eggs
to hatch, the ostrich sitting on them
during the night time and allowing
the sun to do its part In the daytime
by thoroughly heating the sand.
Anyway, tho zoo management Is
gulng to do its best to hae some lit
tle ostriches by hot weather.

Convention hall housed four thou
sand people last night and fully half
as many more were turned away from
the doors when Ijiureiiee D. Kltchell
presented his travelog on Glacier Na
tional patk.
Mr. Kltchell told the audience that
It was the largest crowd he had ever
encountered although he has spoken
In almost every large city In tho
Unite, States. Hundreds of school
children were among the hearers but
they were held under the spell of the
beautiful scenery and the eloquent
desi riplions and mused no confusion.
The travelog was unusual through
out and was the finest tiling tit Its
kind ever staged In this city. The mo
tion pictures which accompanied the
lecture were of very high grade and
an addition to the entertainment.
It dealt with the Glacier park, the
newest of the national parks which is
becoming a mecca for travelers. The
park is located ill northwest Montana
and unlike I lie other parks is noted
Tor Its scenery. It compares with tho
Yellowstone park in that it has over
fifty glaciers but it excels that terri
tory in lis magiilfieicnt scenic effects.
The property is 1,500 square acres of
nature's muster workmanship, it con
tains over seven hundred und fifty
lakes of various sizes and is noted for
Its fishing, this sport being allowed
freely.
On a Trip.
Starting from the twin cities of St
Paul and .Minneapolis, Mr. Kitchell in
his Inimitable, stylo took his auditors
through Minnesota, across tho broad
pruliics of North Dakota and eastern
Montana to the wondei'ful (500,000
rustic hotel at Glacier Park Station,
Mont., the eastern entrance to the
park.
The leclure takes In every point o-'
Interest in the area und trout more
(.specially the vaiieuatod lases which
tank easily with those of Switzer
land. The niackfect Indians, one of
the lew remaining tribes which are
It. Iciest ing to tourists, ure then visited
in their native haunts.
The travelog ended with a
hu-
morons cartoon showing some ot
tho
supposeil trials and tribulations
en
countered on the tour which put
tile
aiiuieni'o in u Una! good humor.
The lecture was so well enjoyed that
I'. O. Tilburne. secretary of the
Chamber of ..Commerce, announced
his determination to schedule a ser
ies of similar entertainments for next
winter.
The travelog was furnished the In.
cul Chamber of Commerce by the Na
tional Korean of Commercial Econ
omics, a brunch of the department
of public Instruction In Washington.
The purpose of the bureau is to pro
mote in America ii knowledge of the
American natural resources, gigantic
Industries und other Items of general
Interest.
The lecturers are furnished abso
lutely free and without any attached
strings. If they ure all like the Kit

about the success of a series of these
