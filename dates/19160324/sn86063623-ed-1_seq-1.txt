Game

ball tossers invaded Lexington
Thursday night expecting to
easily defeat the local girls.
Higginsville's team recently had
its picture in a city paper and
was supposed to be one of the
best in the state. But Thursday
night something unusual hap
pened, Lexington beat her great
est and oldest athletic rival in
all sports, by the score of 28 to
6.
The local defenders began
scoring with the starting of the
game and during the entire con
test never lest the lead. In the
first half the ball was in Lex-ing-cr
territory mot all of the
time, henever the ball went to
that end of the court it re
mained only a few minutes as
the Lexington guards were al
ways on their feet.
Captain "Bill" Ashurst of the
Lexington team was the star of
the contest. She tossed 10 field
goals and one free throw, mak
ing a total of 21 points to her
credit. Virgie Welch made some
long shots and was responsible
for the other counters.
Thursday night's affair was
the clo?ir,r game of the sea
son for t'..2 girls.

five were unable to duplicate the
score of the girls' game of

.working out as much as the
weather has permitted and the
-material at hand seems to be
j strong except in the pitching
' staff. It is hoped, however,
that some worthy succesor to
Fletcher will develop.
j A Preparedness Idea.
"Do I believe in Preparedness?
I believe in it so strongly that I
'am willing to take some very ac
tive steps to assist the young
men of Lexington to prepare
themselves for their country's
'service should the need arise."
I The speaker was Colonel Sellers
of the Wentworth Military Ac
ademy and he went on to say:
Why cannot the young men of
i the community take advantage
of the following offer on the part
I of the school. If a sufficient
number of them will apply, we
jgive the use of arms and they
can have the benefit of the most
capable instruction by Major
; Palmer detailed officer from the
War Department. This would
give them expert instruction
seldom to be gotten in a Militia
Company. The young men
would be eompe'led to give up a
few hours of their time and to
purchase Khaki uniforms at a
cost of a few dollars and in re
turn would receive invaluable
experience and training. I
would like to see a large number
take advantage of this offer, be
cause I am firmly convinced
that every young man should
put himself in shape to be of use
to his country."
Mr. Helsby Will Remain in Lex
1 ington.

especially those of the auto fra
ternity, will be glad to hear that
he is going to remain in Lexing

of Morris' Hotel. Mr. Helsby

ever in Lexington. He will give

;and overhauling machines, and
invites all automobile owners to
bring their troubles to him.

Fined $30.
If you have too many under
the belt, don't try to ride a
bicycle through the Main
Streets, don't get hot headed
and think you are the only cock
on the walk, for, if you do, the
iron hand may reach out and
grab you. Tuesday morning a
young man who has the habit
of doing this was tried in the
police court and was assessed
