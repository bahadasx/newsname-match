A
Notice to Taxpayers.
Last fall I called the-attention of the
public to the fact that the Treasurers
were compelled, by the strict enforce
ment of the state tax law, to close the
books at the end of each month and
charge penalty on all taxes not paid by
March 31st, also that the privilege of
paying in two installments .were
forfeited after April 1st. For the
benefit of the taxpayer, I again say
that taxes are due January 1st and
delinquent March 1st, second half Sept.
1st. Get the habit of paying in March
and September, if you don't expect to
pay full tax and 12 per cent interest
which the law requires the Treasurer
to charge. All receipts that are made
out in advance and remain in the
Treasurer's hands, April 1st will bear
1 per cent, per month penalty until
paid. I also wish to say that I cannot
make out receipts and file them away
herekfter, but will file all back orders
the same as before. Please call for
your receipts before April 1st. I
haven't the time now to take them to
you as before.
Rev. Gammons will preach next Sab
bath morning on the theme "Hidden
Treasure."
Box Ball and Shooting Gallery.
A 15.00 prize will be given to the

School Principal On Trial.
On complaint of Chan Robinson, O. C.
Luce, principal of the Cresco schools,
was placed under arrest for assault and
battery on the person of Virgil Williams,
a pupil of the High School, punished by
Luce for an infraction of school rules
prohibiting whispering. The trial was
held yesterday to a jury before Justice
of the Peace Barker, and as the jury
disagreed, the case was continued until
next Tuesday. The question at issue
is whether or not the the punishment
was excessive, and as the boy was
badly bruised by the instrument of
punishment—a piece of rubber hose—it
would appear that Mr. Robinson has
considerable ground for his complaint.

for its repeal, opposes hard surfaced
roads, says that no bonds for road work
shall-be issued unless authorized by di
rect vote of the taxpayers, and asks
the removal by the board of supervis

his assistants.
The resolutions, csowded out of this
