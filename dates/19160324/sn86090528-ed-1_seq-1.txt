gum and ciggle would learn different-
, ly through the efforts of the teacn

appear upon tho statute books; he
told of the manner In which these
laws had been enacted and of how dif
ferent suctions of the state would ap
pear before the legislative bodies and

WINNER
IN GAME
Only One of Preliminary Basket Ball Bouts
Pulled Off; Committee Working to
Carry Out Schedule of
Events Tonight
The basket ball games, scheduled
for last night, culminated in the play-
lug of only one game, that betw;een
the eighth grade Iboys of Rush (Springs
and the boys of the North school of
Chickasha.
This game proved to be an inter
esting event and waB a feature which
well repaid all who had gathered at
the high school gymnasium to see the
several games which were to have
been staged for1 the evening entertain
ment. The game resulted in a victory
for Rush Springs with a score of 19
to i4. I
Coach Meyers of Verden, formerly
connected with the Central State
normal at Edmond, refereed the game
and gave quick and fair decisions.
The game was played with a rush
and a spirit from start to tiulsti ana
the score was kept close enough to
maintain the interest of all spectators.
Other games on the program were
not played. Amber could not come on
account of being quarantined and the
Amber-Rush Springs game was there
fore forfeited to Rush Springs.
The game which it had been agreed
should be played between the South
and the North wards' teams was for
felted to the North ward, the charges
by tho South school that one of the
players on the North ward school had
been in high school and terefore should
be eliminated from participation in the
game. The South school declined to
play.
Other teams scheduled to play
either failed to show up or forfeited
the games by refusal to play.
A. S. Handcock, W. M, McGranahan
and J. C. Stewart of the executive com
mittee of the Athletic association are
working hard today in an effort to
have the events of this evening pulled
off as pli- schedule, without further
friction. This work will possibly be
accomplished and all games on this
evening's program will be played by
the teams as per schedule, with the ex
ception of Amber.
The schedule for the 'basket ball
contest tonight has been changed on
account of the quarantining of the
Amber schools. As rearranged! the

SHEPARD IN
RACE AGAIN
Moman H. Shepard has announced
hia candidacy for re-election to the of
fice of county superintendent, subject
to the will of the voters at the August
primary election
Jlr, Shepard is serving his firs;
term, being in ofifce since the first
day of July, 1915, and during this time
has proved himself to be a man of fine
ability, well qualified in every way
to fill tho position.
Mr. Shepard is a native of the state
of Virginia, but has lived in Oklahoma
for the past eight years. He taught
in the public schools at Narrows, Va.,
three years, before coming to Okla
homa; in the Enid schools one year
and was principal of the schools at
Verden six yeai'S.
Since entering upon the discharge
of the duties of county superintendent
Mr. Shepard has worked faithfully to
advance the educational interests of
the rural and the village schools.
Working along tha lines calculated to
place Grady in the first rank of the
educational counties of the state, Mi.
Shepard has spared neither labor nor
pains. He has visited the schools ot
the county and has urged upon the
members of the different school laoards
the great need of the hearty co-opera
tion ot those boards with the teach
ers; he has worked hard to add to the
facilities with which teaschers may
bo surrounded and it will be through
his efforts, to a large extent, that the
number of two-room school houses in
the rural sections of Grady county will
be largely increased before the open
ing of the fall of l'J16 school terms;
he ha3 urged upon all teachers the
good which may be accomplished in
the matter ot improving the grounds
and the interiors of their school build
ings; he has urged the parents and
the children to co-operate with the
teachers and the board members in
"keeping your children at home and
educating them in Grady county," and
he feels that the manner in which
the school hoards and the teachers all
over the county have joined hands
with hira in this matter is fast bring
ing this idea into successful practice.
Mr. Shepard has iheen one of the hard
est workers in Oklahoma in tho moon
light school proposition and it has
been largely through his co-operation
in this line that the teachers of the
county have placed Grady at the very
top of the list of Oklahoma moonlight
schools.
Should the voters of Grady county
see fit to re-elect him Mr, Shepard
I romises to exert his every energy in
the future, as he has In the past in
helping to make the schools of Grady
county the best in the state. He will
continue his visits to the different
schools, visiting each school in the
county twice each year, If possible,
giving all his time to furthering things
