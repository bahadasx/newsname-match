F
Admiral Fiske Recommends Es
tablishment of Permanent
Chief of Operations.
The elimination of the Secretary of
the Navy, to all practical Intents, was
the suggestlo nof Admiral Bradley
Flake to the House Naval Committee
today. ,
The admiral, over whose appearance
Congressman" Britten- and Chalrmrn
Padgett had fought for weeks, the
chairman finally consenting, startled
the committee with his proposal. He
recommended the establishment of
permanent chief of operations who
would have authority over the prep
aration of the entire navy for war,
and who could not be overruled by
tho Secretary of the Navy without
authority of Congress.
"If we have a Secretary who comes
In every four years and changes the
entire Btrategy of tho navy we will
never get anywhere." Admiral Flsko
said. "We should havo a law that
would make It impossible for the Sec
retary to change conditions and the
policies of the nevy without appearing
before Congress and securing consent."
Chairman Padgett clashed frequently
with Britten and Roberts, of Massa
chusetts, "big navy" advocates.
fadgett endeavored to bring out by
cross-questioning Fiske that navy of
ficers should not have authority over
the civilian heads of the Navy Depart
ment. Flsko said there should not be
divided authority, lie said ho would not
place the naval officers over the
civilians, but that the chief of opera
tions should have a more extensive au
thority. "It would take five years to put our
navy on an effective basts," Flake, said.
"This opinion has been Indorsed by
every naval officer I have talked to.
Our navy will never be as effective as
those of other countries until the system
Is changed. Since 1IW7 there has been
an lncreaslng-ireallzatlon of the Import
ance of "continued policy of strategy.
It Is easy enough to have a big navy,
but not so easv to have a ?nn,i nn.
The policy of strategy ahould be made
continuous."
Britten said he feared that a Secre
tary could come In and nullify all of
tho effective things done by his pred
ecessors. "I have tso fear that any Secretary
who may be appointed will do anv such
thing," chairman Padgett retorted.
"It has been done," Britten replied.

RECOVERING FROM DRUG
Dentist Reviving From Effects
of "Sleeping Powder" Taken
After Arrest.
NEW YORK. March 24. DIh
trict Attorney Swann announced
this afternoon he had forged the
last link in evidence which he
claims will hold Dr. Arthur
Warren Waitc to answer for the
death of his millionaire father-in-law
and mother.
NEW YORK. March ?4. Dr. Arthur
Warren Walte, suspected In the ms
terlous poisoning of his millionaire
father-in-law, John E. Peek, of Grand
Rapids, Mich., and tho latter's wife, will
be moved from his palatial apartment
overlooking the Hudson today and
lodged In a cell In the Tombs.
Detectives, who guarded Walte closely
throughout the night, said that he Is
slowly recovering from tho effects of the
drug he took whlie they were Unking
him with tho death mystery. Before
night he may be arraigned on the for
mal charge of homicide.
While the watch was being kept at
Walto's marble-walled apartment on
Riverside Drive, District Attorney
Bwann went over the evidence In what
he asserts Is the most puzzling crlnio
story he has over dealt with.
Charges Against Doctor.
The district attorney gave out today
tho following amazing charges already
made In the probe of the Grand Rapids
millionaire's mysterious death:
That Dr. Walte. the night beforo
Peck died, "poured something rrom a
small vial" into a pinto of soup nnd
also Into a cup of ten placed before
his father-in-law. This charge was
made by Dora Illlller, the West Indian
Degress maid:

Hotel, near Central Park, for a myste
rious woman who has disappeared;
That Dr. Walte apparently had no
practice and found time to become the
Indoor tennis champion of New York,
though his living expenses must have
.totaled $50.ow a year. .
Search Is being continued today for
the mysterious woman, who Is said lo
have slipped out of the Plaza Hotel
while detectives wero hot on hor trail
for an explanation of her relations with
tho doctor.

Allies Reject Plan
To Disarm Liners
Joint Reply Received Today at
State Department on U. S.
Proposal.
The Joint reply of tho altfea to tho
Htato Department's proposal that mer
chantmen bo disarmed was received at
the State Department today.
It Is understood from the highest au
thority that the proposal was not ac
cepted, the allies replying that the sit
uation and conditions of naval warfare
did not warrant them in subjecting
those, vessels to the risk of disarma
ment. SUGAR TARIFF RAISE
PROPOSED BY GORE
Would Bring to Treasury Revenue
of Over $100,000,000.
If a plan which was proposed by Sen
ator Gore In the Senate Finance Com
mittee today should be adopted, sugar
would bring In to the Treasury a rev
enue of over $100,000,000.
Senator Gore urged that In addition to
existing duty, sugar near an additional
half cent customs tariff, and an oxclso
tax of a cent a pound, this to be an
emergency plan to last through the Eu
roepan war.
Tho committee did .not act on the
sugar tariff question, and will meet
again tomorrow. Senator Goro said his
plan would bring In 160,000,000 additional
rovenuo from sugar.
A problem which members of the com
mittee are considering In this connec
tion Is hoW to meet tho cost of the
Mexican expedition If It is prolonged.

OonirrMsryw JInn'n H. Matfden. of
Illinois 'filed i'le nttentlon of tlis

clarrd tlkt they were "Indecent and
not fit for publication on the Records
of Congiesr."
"I do not Intend that tho Congres
sional Record shall he used as a cess
pool." said Mr. Madden. "Some of ho
language contained In this speech Is
sitch that no respectable newspaper In
the United State would print It. Lan
guage that tho newspapers cannot
print should not be allowed In the
Record nr this tiouse.
Are Called Libelous.
The Illinois member added that Mr.
Davis' speech contained "vile epithets
that could not be published In a news
paper nnd would be libelous If pub
lished anywhere else, but the Rec
ord."
"He seems to have wasnea tne ainy
llnen of some Texas controversy," said
Mr. Madden.
Mr. Madden drat moved that the
speech be expunged from the Record
fortnwitn.
It was suggested by Congresiman
Garrett. Garner and other that the

During the hubbub .Mr. Davis arose
and nshed "under whet rules were wo

member of the House"
The Speaker Informed the Texan that
the Houae was proceedings under Its
general rules, and that If a commltttee
were named he would have a right to
NDDear before It In oerson or bv counsel.
This seemed to satisfy Mr. Davis.
The Davis speech was printed under
unanimous consent for "extension of re
marks," and was not delivered on the
floor. It was published In the Wed

certain criticisms made of "Cyclone"
by a Texas newspaper writer Mr.

Icsder Menu, with whom he had had a
verbal tilt several days before.
Some of His Language.
As asserted by Mr. Madden some or
the language used by Mr. Davis Is re
garded as unprintable. Some of the
milder terms used by "Cyclono" In his
reply to his Texas critic were:
" To call this man a child of
the devil would be to slander the devil.
"It Is supposed that he had
been hibernating with fallen women and
depraved men In boon companionship
wltn gruesome gangs of gamblers,
thugs, thieves, and sandbaggers.
"I Con't know this man. If man he
be; he may bo some pusillanimous

"Cyclone" said In the opening para
graphs of his speech that he had been
attacked becaus- ho paid tribute to
Gen. Nelson A. Miles in a prior speech
on the floor. Because he called General
Mlks n "grand old patriot." expjlalned
Ih Texas member, a Houston (Tex )
newspaper had waved the "bloody
shirt."
The prior speech also attacked J. P.
.Morgan, the llnuor traffic, "money
mongers and sordid tr"st master." and
the preparedness program. Thts, he
said, "made Morgan's minions and the
defenders of the damnable liquor traf
fic who runs newspapers furious."

The result was a series of sharp

Decides Against Call
For Gaurdsmen
There will be no mobilization

The President and his Cabinet
decided today that there is

The question of calling out the

The Administration believes
that mobilization of tht

Senator Ashurst was undetermined
this morning whether to present the

Army Men Not Alarmed.
The Carranxlstos have had a large
garrison near Douglass for some
months. In November It was about
6.000.
Army men are not inclined to regard
the situation there as in any way crit
ical, tor they believe, even should there
be an uprising, the American forces,
far better trained and equipped, could
easily cope with a vastly larger num
ber of the Mexicans.
In the Carranzlsta garrison arc a large
number of boys of from twelve to four
teen years of age. Few of them are
even fair marksmen. It Is said, as was
demonstrated In the Vllllsta-Carranxa
clash at Agua Prleta several months
ago. when several million rounds of
small ammunition were flred away with
comparatively Insignificant casualties.
Tho telegram to Ashurst reads:
"Mex'can general has fortv pieces of
artillery and 3,000 cavalry stationed ten
blocks from center of Douglas. Seven
thousand cavalry stationed six miles
south of Douglas. We have only 1,800
Infantry, 300 cavalry, and four pieces
of artillery. Our troops stationed two
miles oast of Douglas.
Mexicans Have Entrenched.
"Am reliably Informed It would re
quire one hour for our troops to reach
Douglas In case of night attack. Our
army forbidden by Administration from
matting any active defense preparations
for fear Mexicans might misconstrue
such preparations.
"Mexicans have entrenched against
United States side, and have barbed
wire entanglements, we have no en
trenchment. Mexican troops could
easily repeat Columbus massacre In
Douglas on much larger scale and re
turn to Mexico with similar loss. All ot
these statements can be verified by our
army officers here. Help us If you can
before It is too late."
Senator Ashurst said his Informant
was a responsible attorney,
