Defer Construction of Owosso Flint
Division.
Owing to the fact that materials for
railroad construction at the present
time are from 25 to 100 per cent higher
than normally, the Owosso to Flint
section of the Michigan Railways lines
will not be built until another season.
The extension would connect the Saginaw-Bay
City division with the Grand
Rapids Jackson division, and is a very
desirable move. .

Two New Theatres.
The Flint Journal has the olio wing
to say concerning work being done by
Architect Geo. Bachmann of that city:
"Plans for two theatres in Owosso
are being designed by Bachmann. One
of the theatres is to be conducted by
the Strand Theatre company of Owosso.
It will be located on Washington street
at an estimated cost of $30,000. The
building is to have a semi fireproof wall
constructed of brick and terra cotta.
The interior will be decorated in light
relief ornamental plaster of the Adams
order. It will be modern in every re
spect Another theatre to be erected
in Owosso will be a beautiful semi fire
proof building to be erected on Main
street by B L Converge. It will be on
lines similar to the Strand theatre. The
estimated cost Is $20,000.
Knights Templar Inspection.
The annual inspection of Owosso
Commandery Knights Templar was
conducted March 16 by F. A. Aldrich,
Deputy Grand Commander. A ban
quet by the Eastern Star lodge was
served before the inspection, the most
excellent menu being served at prettily
decorated tables placed in the form of a
passion cross. Following the banquet
solos by T. F. Coulter and E. C. Rex
ford and remarks by Rev. B. G. Matt
son on "The Ideals of Templar Ma
sonry," and by A. L. Chandler on the
practical side of Templar Masonry; by
Mr. Aldrich, and Judge Matthew Bush
for Corunna Commandery made a pleas
ant and instructive program.
The inspection showed Owosso Com
mandery in fine condition and Eminent
Commander August T. Birk was com
mended by Mr. Aldrich.
Save Waste Paper and Rags.
The U. S. Department of Commerce
is sending circulars all over the coun
try calling attention to the importance
of saving waste paper and rags of all
descriptions because of the serious
shortage of raw material for the
manufacture of paper. It states that
something like 15,000 tons of differ
ent kinds of paper and paper board
is manufactured every day in the
United States and that a large pro
portion of this, after it lias served its
purposes, could be, used over again in
some class of paper. A large part
of it is, however, burned or otherwise
wasted, and has to be replaced by
new materials. The advice given
years ago to save rags is as import
ant to the paper industry now as when
first given.. A little attention to the
saving of rags and old papers will
mean genuine relief to the paper in
dustry and a diminishing drain upon
the resources of the country for new
material. As there is a market some
revenue will come from following the
advice.
Organization of Mutual Fire Insur
ance Co. Advocated.
Fire insurance rates seem to come in
for a good many knocks in Owo9?o just
at present and as a means of relief, W.
H. VanSlce favors the organization of a
mutual company in this city. At the
last meeting of the Improvement
Association he presented figures show
ing something as to the cost of insur
ance and the amount paid for losses in
this city, the latter being merely
nominal for the last six years. W. C.
Cadwallader, C. R. Wolford tftid R. P.
Bigelow, representing various insurance
companies, were of the opinion that a
mutual company could not be success
fully maintained and cited instances of
many other similar companies which
bad failed. Mr. Bigelow intimated
rather strongly that the main trouble
at present comes from the law passed
by the last legislature which prevents
competition in Insurance rate. O. L.
Sprague referred to the steady increase
in rates during the years he bad been
engaged in business in Owosso. The
matter was referred to a committee
consisting of W. TI. VanSlce. W. C.
Cadwallader. W. E Hall, R P. Bige
low snd O L Spragne.
Firemen's Law Unconstitutional.:
Judge W. G. Gage, of Saginaw, has
decided that the law passed by the
last legislature giving city firemen one
day off in four and two ten-day fur
loughs each year is unconsitutional
as it "is a violation of the rights of
the city to local self-government,'
and that if the legislature could pass
such measures it could, by successive
acts of this kind, abrogate all the self
governing authority given cities un
der the home rule law of 1900 and the
home rule provision of the state con
stitution. The Owosso City Commis
sion refused to recognize the validity
of the law and it has not been opera
tive in this city. Their action has
made quite a saving in the expense of
the fire department during the year.
Park Bonds Approved.
The members of the Improvement
Association by unanimous vote at the
Tuesday meeting endorsed the pro
posed issue of bonds in the sum of
$6,500 for the purchase and improve
ment of the land surrounding the new
armory and pledged active support
for the same at the approaching city
election. This proposition seems to
meet with general approval and if
carried the land, three or more acres,
will probably be acquired and will
give the city a very fine central park.
Women tax-payers can vote upon this
question and it is understood the sev
eral women's clubs and organizations
will be active in securing a favorable
vote.
Armory Nearing Completion.
Before the end of another week the
new State armory will be practically
completed. The carpenter work is
about out of the way and the inside
finish is being pushed along by the
painters. The marble bases for the
toilets and swimming pool room have
been shipped and as soon as they are
received the work of installing the
marble wainscotting and putting in
the tile floors will be commenced. This
work will require two weeks' time so
that the building ought to be ready
for final inspection and acceptance by
the State Military Board by April
15th. The lighting fixture contract
has been awarded to Townsend & Ful
mer, who will install the same within
a few days. The lockers for the mem
bers of the Company and for the In
firmary have been ordered and it is
expected that shipment will be made
as soon as the building is completed.
A board walk approach to the main
entrance will probably be laid tempor
arily ponding a decision as to wheth
er t lie adjacent land is purchased for
park uses, after which permanent
walks will be built.
Predicts Hughes' Nomination.
Caro, Mich., March 21. The predic
tion of Congressman Joseph W. Ford
ney of Saginaw, that Supreme Justice
Charles E. Hughes of New York will
be the Presidential nominee of the Re
publican national convention drew wild
applause and cheers tonight from the
more than 400 Republicans attending
the banquet here of the Tuscola County
Republican club, at which many Mich
igan notables made addresses, among
them several whose names will appear I
of the party.
Representative Fordney declared Jus
tice Hughes the strongest Presidential
possibility in the Republican party and
criticised President Wilson's action in
sending United States troops into Mex
ico as a move made for its political
effect and to satisfy a purely personal
whim, instead of for its announced pur
pose of restoring peace in the southern
republic and avenging the massacre of
American citizens along the Mexican
border.
Mitchell-Millard.
A pretty wedding took place Wed
nesday at high noon at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. J. Mitchell, Hickory
street, when their daughter, Miss
Iva, became the bride of William
Millard of Burton. The wedding
ceremony was read by Rev. F. E.
Kunsman, pastor of the Burton M.'
P. church In tho presence of about
thirty-five, invited guests. i
Following the ceremony a wed
ding dinner was served. The Mitch
ell home was attractively decorated
for the event with cut flowers and
greenery.
Mr. and Mrs. Millard are well
known In this city. The bride Is a
graduate of the Owosso Business col
lose and for the past several months
has been employed In the general of
fices of the Union Telephone Co.'
They will make their future home on
tho groom's form near Burton.
The many friends in this vicinity
extend congratulations . and best
wishes to Mr. and Mrs. Millard for
fuluro happiness.
REV. W.H. JORDAN RESIGNS
Rector of Christ Episcopal Churoh
Will Go to Grand Ledge
, May First.
Rev. W. H. Sordan, rector of Christ
Episcopal church, tendered his resigna
tion as rector at the morning service,
Sand ay, and asked to be relieved April
30. He has accepted a call to Trinity
church at Grand Ledge. Rev. Jordan
has seryed the church here two years,
coming from Fon du Lac, Wisconsin,
and his departure will be much re
gretted by his many friends who will
hope for a successful pastorate at Graud
Ledge.
Rev. Jordan will present a class of
twelve or more for confirmation March
29.
AUGUST 22-25.
Shiawassee County Fair and Racing
Meet Will Be Held Early.
The county fair dates have been
named as August 22. 23, 24, 25, in con
nection with the short ship racing cir
cuit dates. The grounds are being im
proved, the track will be put in fine
shape and preparations made for a big
attendance.
' Alasl The Small Boy.
Soon the small boy of Grand Rapids
will have stood for the last time in mute
admiration as the fire horses rush
madly in response to an alarm. Fire
Marshal Boughner announces that all
horse-drawn apparatus in the depart
ment will be sold to nearby small
towns, and in its place we shall have
only motor cars. The automobile fire
apparatus may be more efficient, it does
offer more certain promise of protec
tion, but it never can give to the small
boy the thrills which radiated from
every burst of speed from the fine,
strong horses of the yesterdays. Anoth
er of the attractions of boy life is gone.
The Twentieth century and it efficien
cy are not friends of boyhood. Grand
Rapids Herald.' - ? -
Owosso, too, apparently will join the
growing list of cities which will de
prive not only the small boy but many
of more mature years of the pleasure
mentioned as motorization of the fire
department is probable.
Women's Clubs Approve Bonding.
The Federation of Women's clubs
has become actively Interested In the
proposition to centralize and motor
ize the fire department, and several
meetings are being planned for next
week at which Mayor De Young will
explain the plan to the ladles. The
federation plans a meeting for Tues
day or Wednesday afternoon at the
public library, while the Current
Topic club will have a meeting Mon
day afternoon at which the mayor
and Citv Attorney Miner will talk.
Mrs. Maude Thompson, president
of the federated clubs is making ar-j
rangements ror the meeting at the
library. As woman freeholders may
vote on the proposed bond is3ue, the
club women believe it their duty to
get all the information possible and
the mayor is pleased to give them
all the data he has.
Word came to the commissioners
Thursday that voters In the fifth
ward were lining up against the
proposition because, a report circu
lated In that ward said, that the
commission has given no assurance
that the central station, if erected,
will be located at the corner of Main
and Shiawassee street, but might be
located down town.
"You can tell the people in the
fifth ward," said the mayor to the
mi uhn l-rrn trV f ta Inffirmaflftn tn
him "that the site at the corner of
Main and Shiawassee is the only one
we have under consideration for the I
central station. This lot is ideally
located for a fire station because it is
at the geographical center, of the
city. In addition, it is close to prac-.
tically all factories in the city. We)
have nothing to conceal about our
plans. We want the people to have
all the Information possible on the'
subject, that they may vote Intelli
gently." The salary of Assistant Postmaster
II. P. White has been Increased 1 100 a,
year effective from April 1st. It is
well deserved.
Miss Wllma Demuth left this
morning for Youngstown, Ohio, to
spend the spring vacation at the home
of her grandparents. Mr. and Mrs.
Demntb have been there a number of
days on account of the sickness of the
latter's mother. j
Dr. E S. Walton, of Richmond, fath
er of Fred Walton, formerly well
known In Owosso, died Saturday night.
Fred Walton was formerly editor of
the 8hlawassee Reporter, but for many
years hs been employed by the Robert
Smith Piintlng company at Lansing.
HOTEL PROSPECTS
ARE BRIGHTER
Proposal to Organize Company to
. Purchase and Enlarge Wildermuth
Option Given for Ninety-n.ne Year
Lease on National.
At the close of the business half-hour
session at the Improvement Associa
tion luncheon, Tuesday, the hotel com
mittee considered an informal proposi
tion made by E. B. Hcffiran for the
organization of a company with a stock
of 140,000 to purchase, enlarge and re
model the Hotel Wildermuth, provid
ing a Urger aud more up to date office,
dining room and kitchen on the first
floor, additional sleeping rooms with
baths on the second and third floors;
toilet rooms in the basement and other
changes which would make a modern
hotel. The plan would include two
small stores on the ground floor to be
rented Mr. Hoffman has already con
sulted an architect who has looked the
property over and it is expected that a
prospective sketch with an estimate as
to cost will soon be prepared. The
stock issue Is to consist of $20,000 pre
ferred and $20,000 common, each to
have voting privilege, the former to
draw G per cent with the same amount
to the common stock in case the earn
ings are sufficient earning above this
amount to be divided equally or used as
the management may deem best. The
stock will be in $50 shares, one share or
more of each kind to be sold to stock
holders and Mr. Hoffman will accept
in payment for the property, 66 feet
frontage on Washington street and 193
feet deep on Comstock, $20,000 in stock,
half preferred and half common. On
this basis all stockholders would be on
an equal footing and the management
would be in charge of a board of direc
tors. Since the meeting Tuesday, the
necessary legal papers haye been drawn
aud some stock subscriptions made. Mr.
Hoffman intends to push the matter
along as rapidly as possible.
While the deal for the National hotel
property has not as yet taken definite
form there is a strong probability that
it will shortly. U. M. Butterworth of
Lansing, architect of the new Lincoln
school, has obtained ah option for a
ninety-nine year lease on the property
and the lease covering the same has
been received and is now under consid
eration by the management of the Pat
terson estate, owners of the property.
Mr. Butter field contemplates the organ
ization of a company capitalized at
$120,000 to erect a four story building,
a portion of the lower floor to be used
for store purposes and the balance for a
magnificent modern hotel, the present
bdilding to be entirely torn down. Mr.
Butterworth informed the hotel com
mittee at a meeting on Friday last that
while he desired to have Owosso capi
tal interested in the project he was
prepared to carry it throngh in any
event and that within a year a fine new
hotel would 6tand on the National
corner.
Owohso needs better hotel accommo
dations and the citizens will ba inter
ested in these propositions.
'I'll Convert Ford to Prepardness.'
New York, March 21. While pack
ing some newly invented bait that will
make any fish leave home, Thomas
A. Edison paused long enough in his
West Orange laboratory last night to
remark : "We're in for big trouble in
Mexico, but we'll blunder through it.
"Germany will last one more year
and then will he crushed.
"Every young buck in this country
ought to be trained to be a soldier.
"Rut you can't force prepardness
on this country until it is too late.
"After the European war, prepard
ness agitation here will die out, and
then war with us will be n walkover
for some nation.
"This nation will flourish for
awhile, will reach its apex, then will
deteriorate and die.
"All nations have risen and fallen.
Germany is on the wane. Our turn
will come.
"We've got to get more efficiency
in this country. Nothing can be wast
ed. Everything must be done well.
"There should be an income tax for
all. Workingmen would be willing
to pay at least a dollar a year.
"Henry Ford will be my guest in
Florida and I'jn going to convert him
to preparedness.
"If this country goes to war, you
may be surellenry Ford will place
his plants and his fortune at the dis
posal of the government." .
Mr and Mrs. Francis Palmer of St,
John?, were in the city Thursday on
business connected with the estates of
Mr. and Mrs. W. II,IIalstead.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED
Commislon Wants Thorongh Under
standing of Bonding Propositions.
The city commission U pleased to
answer the questions of "Taxpayer"
in regard to the proposed Improve
ment in the Fire Department, as fol
lows: First: Motor driven apparatus
gives better service because it can
get away from the fire house quicker
can go faster and reach tho tire soon
er than horse drawn apparatus.
Each hose truck Is provided with a
pump capable of throwing one pow
erful stream of water at a much
higher pressure than Is furnished
from the water mains. This would
be a decided advantage in the case
of fire In a factory, large business
building or where, the water mains
were small and tho pressure from
them low.
Second: The yearly cost of oper
ating the present horse drawn sys
tem Is $11,581.83 and the yearly
cost of operating the motor driven
system would be $8.642.fc,-l or S2,
916.00 less than it is now costing
the city This saving Is enough to pay
the. aerage interest on bonds and
pay $2,000.00 per year on the prin
cipal without adding to the taxes. Or
in other words the city can havo the
use of a modern motor driven dri
department without adding one cent
to the taxes and at the end of fifteen
years own the plant. After the plant
Is paid for the net saving to the city
will be approximately $3,000.00 per
year. We believe this a splendid
business proposition.
Third: The fact that such cities
as Lansing, Bay City, Saginaw, Flirt
and scores of others have substitut
ed motor driven for horse-drawn fire
apparatus ought to be conclusive
evidence that motor driven appara
tus "an successfully negotiate dirt
roads. If there Is any question In
the mind of "Taxpayer" In regard to
this matter, we suggest that he visit
Flint where he will find dirt roads
compared to which the dirt roads of
Owosso are boulevards, yet the in
surance companies think so well of
Flint's motor driven fire department
that they have given her a class two
rating. There are only two other
cities In this Insurance class in Mich
igan Grand Rapids and Detroit,
both of which are completely equip
ped with" motor driven apparatus.
Most of the cities in Mic.iisan are in
classes ranging from 24 to 5. Owos
fo is in class three. No city that has
once adopted the motor driven ap
paratus has ever returned to horse
drawn apparatus.
Fourth: This we believe Is cover
ed in the answer, to your third ques
tion, however we hope, In the near
future, to publish some letters from
fire chiefs of cities having motor
driven apparatus giving their exper
iences. Fifth: The worklngman who lives
outside the business district will re
ceive more benefit from a motor
driven fire department than any oth
er Ind'.i'.i'.al "n the city, because liv
ing at a distance, the motor driven
machines would reach his home In
probably half the time taken by
horse d'awn apparatus, reaching the
fire "vhr. the chemical which eacn
motor driven machines carries could
be used more effectively, and in case
the chemicals were not sufficient and
there were no water mains the
pumps with which each motor hose
truck is provided could take water
from any well, cistern or creek In
the vicinity and with them subdue
the fire.
Sixth: The. bonded indebtedness,
when the commission came Into of
fice was $256,000.00, today it is
$241,500 or a reduction In two
years of $14,500.00. In addition to
this there has been placed In the
sinking fund $1,300.00 making the
reduction In tho bonded Indebted
ness $15,800.00
We wish to thank "Taxpayer" for
asking these questions, through the
newspapers and hope . that citizens
will fol'ow iiis example :n this la an
Impor-r.ut (itcstlon and every voter
shoull be. 'm ) Informed th?ro on be
fore casting, ballot.
Yours very respectfully,
The City Commission,
James DeYoung, Mayor.
