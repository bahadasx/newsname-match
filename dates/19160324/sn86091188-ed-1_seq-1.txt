All life is the story of the conflict in
men's lives between tiie t *o visions.
Tiie two visions come to each of u»
constantly and we are forced to choose
between them Sometimes It ■* cost

it is more cos ly to refuse to folio*
It. It is most costly to ours Ives to
follow the selfish vision liecause sel
fishness make« a dwarfed and a nar
row life. Unselfishness make« a life
that Is large and strong. It Is costly
to other», also. f or us to follow the
«elfish vision because it means a loss
ot service to the world about us: It
means Dial stone kindness should lie
shown, sou e life will miss an indu*
