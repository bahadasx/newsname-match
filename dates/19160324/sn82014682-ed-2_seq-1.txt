ternoon that he has received an or
der to take his ship to Satr Francisco
and report to the . division commander
of the coast guard service A Nothing
was said in the order about disposal
of the ship, but the commander says
he thinks the Thetis will not return
here nor her officers and crew. ' -
Built, in 1881 at Dund'ee,' Scotland,
the Thetis; has had an adventurous
career. She was purchased ,by the
government in '188 J for-, use in the
rescue of the Greeley arctic -expedition
and -after1 she i returned was
turned over to the navy. The revenue
cutter service obtained her la 1890.
She has been stationed at Honolulu
for five or six years.; : ' ;.;.'
.The Thetis has not been" suitable
as a coast guard cutter,' because she
has njt sufficient 'power. She can
make 10 knots en hour under steam
and saiL r with; favorable winds, but
with head ' winds and rough seas can
not do more than four or five knots.
As coast, guard vessels are now used
for rescue work, helping ships In dis
tress, and in life saving, they must
have high speeJ and be able to ma
neuver in all sorts of weather. ;
Capt. Brown says there have been
rumors that the Algonquin, now being
repaired at Nor.'olk Navy Yard, will
succeed the Thetis, but that no offi
cial Information has yet been received
by. him. The Thetis Is now 'making
minor repairs to. her engines In prep
aration 1 for. the voyage to San Fran
cisco. 1 She will take 350 tons of coal
next week. The Algonquin could not
get here before October. ;

this morning, said that in all probabil

'The consumption tax Is figured to
reach the consumer the . man wh3
buys sugar . for bis own use," salt
Collector Haley'V "It would, however,
be exceedingly difficult to collect ths
tax through the retailer who sell to
the consumer, because of the count
less number of stores, large and small,
which would handle sugar.
"While we know nothing, officially
of this : proposed tax it would seen
that the tax would be collected at a

Very likely internal revenue stamps
would be issued, -as is the case for
the present internal revenue-taxel
commodities."'' . ..

Originally it was , proposed in Con

being debated the. manufacturers wero
sending. out huge orders to their cus
tomers, so that Congress foresaw its
Inability to ' realize much reveau2
from imposing the tax on the manu

and the tax imposed on the seller. I."
