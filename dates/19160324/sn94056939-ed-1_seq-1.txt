Tho various mines of tho state
havn been onerated recently to

come to a realization of the fact
that the state's mineral productions

Three great frunk lines of rail-

moans of tho old fashioned stage
coach or thn moro primitivo burro,
but much attention has been givon
in tho last few years to tho publio
highways of the state, with a view
to conforming them to the present
stnndord of good roads, and tho
recent securing of funds for this
purpose will aid, very materially,
in brlnnlng the producer closer to
the matkets by giving him an easier
mantis of roachlng them.
The idea impressed upon tho
minds uf children a generation ago
that Now Mexico was a part of the
"Great American Desert " has be
come somewhat modified through
elosor acquaintance with her many
resources, and this State no longer
is regarded as tho home of tho sage
brush, wild Indian, cactus and
Spanish bayonet only, but is more
eeuerally regarded as tho "Land of
Opportunity."
Tho Indians of New MexI:o are
neither wild nor savage but dwell
in peace and harmony with their
white neighbors, cultivating their
fields, raising livestock, weaving

su in tribal groups tho sphero ol

to lew unon sueíi accumulations

is the whole life, tho community is
nil, tho individual nothing. In
such n society, examples of which
wo see in the remains of our Indian
pueblos, it may bo said t. once that
either there is no taxation or that
there is nothing bul tnxotion In
