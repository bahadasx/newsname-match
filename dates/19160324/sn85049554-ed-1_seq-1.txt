4 The El Oso district, where fighting Is
reported, is considered by Amerlcara
of ioag residence In Mexico, to be the

Is nMed especially for its fine potatoes,:

ot wheat and corn and a natural grass'
that grows knee high in the meadows.
Altibo the farms have suffered much
-from rains, the peons still persist In

and water.
The vallles are wide and flat, cut

HERRERA LOYAL,
SAYS U. S. CONSUL
General Funaten in Turn Reports to
Washington That Herrera Wires De
nial to General Gavira, Carrarvza
Commander.in North Mexioo—Wash
ington Relieved by Reoeipt of Defin
ite News.
Washington, March 24.—American
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua today re
ported there was no truth in the re
ported revolt of General Herrera and
the Carranxa garrison at Chihuahua.
Altho General Funs ton and General
Bell have received reports confirming
the report of revolt which they believed
to be true, the dispatch from Consul
Letcher, who Is on the ground, is taken
by officials here as confirming the
statements of Carranza officials that no
such revolt has occurred.
CODsyi Letoher's dispatch reported
that General Herrera was in command
of the d^: facto troops there and was
"loyal to General .Carranza."
His report- is regarded as removing
of one of the most mfenaclr.g features
of the Mexican situations.
General Funston sent this telegram
to the war department today:
"Gfeneral Herrera in a telegram to
Gavira strongly denies all reports that
he haB gone over to Villa. General
Gutlene#, governor of phlhuahua, in a
letter to General Gavlra, also strongly
denies that General Herrera has gone
over to Villa."
Washington Officials Relieved.
Responses to the telegraphic instruc
tions sent to American consuls at ChU
huahua and Durango to report imme
diately concerning the reported revolt
of Luis Herrera and his 2,000 Carraasa
troops, were awalted~with keen Interest
today by administration officials in the
fiope.that they would clear up the per
rt^M&dituatlon
tfcerbordfr saying, Gen-^
ifal* Belt' bad n,otlfl6d "General Punston
that the freport of tie Herrera revolt
had been confirmed was met by a state
ment from Secretary Bnkor that he had
not been so advised.
Denials of the Herrera revolt and the
satisfactory progress of diplomatfc ne
gotiations with the Carranza govern
ment lessened anxiety in official circles
regarding the safety of the American
expedition.
Ready to Meet Emergencies.
The problem of meieting any request
General Funston might make for rein
forcements in event of a rebellion of
Carranza's army was under considera
tion, however, if .the Amercian forces
were serlousy attacked It was regarded
as likely that all available troops on the
border would be rushed into Mexico and
these troops would be replaced on the
border at onco.
Reply from General Carranza to the
request that American troops be per
mitted to use the Mexican Northwest
ern railway was expected today.
Border reports said General Pershing
was already using a portion the line
and department officials pointed, out
it was possible he had reached a lim
ited agreement with local Mexican rail
road officials.
Direct, word from the Tamplco dis
trict, where ahti-American disturb
ances have been reported, were anx
iously awaited today from the Battle
ship Kentucky and the gunboat Ma
nillas, off Tamplco.
Quiet in-.Mexioo Towns.
State department dispatches from
Durango, San Luis Potosi, Nogales and
other pointo reported quiet Americans
were leaving the Durango region but
there was pq&antUAraerican outbreak.
American cbiuular Agent Williams
at Torreon, who left his post, was or
dered out by the American Rubber
Company, which employed him. He Is
not in the.regular consular service.
The navy department had no word
from Tamplco. The gunboat Machias,
at Tamplcp, failed to respond to radio
calls.
Border agnnts have been Instructed to
watch ammunition shipments to Mex
ico. At the state department It was
said the orders meant no ammunition
would r*ach Jciuraiiza forces whose
"loyalty was doubted.
First advices frqm. Tampico, where
the situation has been causing alarm,
came today to the state department
saying the conditions were uncertain.

quate by the leaders of the prepared
ness movement/but not without giving
evidence of willingness to accept a
larger army and more effective organi
sation of all land fofces lii the ilnsl
shaping of the legislation.
ThlB hopeful prospect was furnished
by the roll call on the Kahn amend
ment providing for an army of 280,000
men, which was defeated by'the nar
row margin of twenty-two votes, 1»1
members favoring and 213 opposing It
This amendment proposed as a sub
stitute for the Hay bill limiting the
army to 140,000 men, was defeated last
Monday by a vote of 103 to-183 in the
committee of the whole, in which there
Is no roll call.
Since then the members have been
"hearing from home," with the result
that a large number experienced a
change of conviction and went on rec
ord in favor of the large army plan.
The senate will reach the Hay bill
and pass the Chamberlain bill provid
ing for an army of 178,000 men capa
ble of expansion to 250,000 men. If a
dozen of the members Who voted
against the Kahn amendment yes
tcTday should change their views in
the meantime the house will accept the
Chamberlain, provision. Othsrwlse the
dfference between the two measures
will be compromised in the conference
committee of the houses.
Before passing the Hay bill the
house by a vote of 224 to 180 knocked
out the Muscle Shoals water power
Joker, which recently was exposed as
a scheme to hand a valuable conces
sion to the water power trust without
proper compensation to the govern
ment.
The Hay army increase bill, first of
the administration's big preparedness
measures to recMve the approval of
either branch of congress, Was in the
hands of the ssnate today.

Because of Rumor.

from D. A. Richardson, of Douglas.
Ariz., saying Moxlcan troops wer*
massing across the line from Douglas
pointing out that the Columbus mas
sacre could easily be repeated in tha
Arizona town, and asking for "help be
fore It was too late," was made publld

Senator Ashhurst said he kneif
Klchardson and regarded his informa
tion as authoratlve.
"I am giving this telegram for pub
lication," said the senator, "and will
not even submfH it to the senate be
cause it would be useless."
Richardson's telegram follows:
"Mexican general has forty pieces of
srtillery and s.0000 cavalry stationed
ten blocks from eenter of Zfougla*.
Seven thousand cavalry six mites
south of Douglas. We have only 1,800
infantry. 800 cavalry and four pieces
of artillery. Our troops stationed two
miles east of Douglas. Reliably In
formed it would take one hour for our
troops to reach Douglas case night at
tack. Advised our troops directed
make no preparations fear may causs
trouble with Mexicans. Mexican troops
could easily repeat Columbus mas­
sacre
in Douglas on much larger scale.
All these statements can be verified by
our army officers here. Help us If yrtl
can before It Is too late."
Conflicting reports of the massing ol
Carranza troops on the border reached
