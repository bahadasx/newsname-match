"EVERYBODY'S
HOUSE" BURNS
Landmark, at Crab Orchard Destroy
ed Old Folks' Concert a De
lightful Affair.
Crab Orchard, March 24.
Early Wednesday morning the
house on Lancaster street occupied
by Mr. and Mrs. Elam, was discov
ed to be on fire, and as a terrific
wind was blowing, it was soon beyond
control. Excitement ran high when
it was said Mrs. Elam was in bed,
and burning to death and many he
roic efforts were put forth to save
her. Mrs. Mary Morgan rushed in
to the burning building to save her,
and had the whole front part of her
hair burned off. Little Frank Ad
ams was also a hero, who rushed in
and by main force dragged Mr. Elam
out. Mrs. Elam was not in the house
as was supposed, but safe on the out
side. The building known as "Ev
erybody's House," was entirely de
stroyed and about one hundred bales
of hay which were stored in the up
per part. The building was owned
. by the Buchanan heirs, and was once
the home of Mrs. Rena Stuart. The
owners had several hundred dollars
insurance with a Stanford agent. By
great and heroic efforts of citizens of
the town, the College and house be
longing to Mr. Chadwick, just oppo
site, were saved. Prof. Hatfield and
his teachers in the Graded School
assembled all the children in the low
er recitation room, on the East side
of building, ready at a moment's no
tice to escape in safety. The smoke
and heat in front of the college was
suffocating, and windows hot, anda
strong wind blowing the flame to it,
seemed a miracle it, should escape.
Mr. and Mrs. Elam, old and sick and
perfectly helpless, are turned out
without saving one thing, not even
clothing and were sent to the home
of Maurice Perkins until some place
can be secured for them. This is such
a fine chance for those financially
blessed to show their gratitude to
God, by donating something to help
these poor, old, worthy people to feel
they are not entirely forsaken, and
cast away.

The Concert given by the old la
dies of the Christian church at Crab
Orchard Springs Satuiday evening
was -a great success. Not only did
everyone express himself well paid
for attending, but they made the old
ladies feel good by their kind ex
pression and compliments of their
work. $39.80 were the proceeds and
the old ladies desire to thank each
one present both for attendance, and
kind words of praise. The old songs
were enjoyed and the music and act
ing was especially good. The dia
logues for the occasion, "A Back
woods Merchant of Kentucky," act
ed by Thomas Hays Bronaugh and
Billy George Holdman, and "An Old

Miss-Tanner Thompson and was splen
didly rendered, as was the sweet old
song, "When You and I Were Young
Maggie," by Misses John Eva Hilton
and Tanner Thompson.
Instrumental duet by Miss Ste
phenson and Mrs. Pettus, "Midnight
Fire Alarm," was splendidly render
ed, and the duet played by Mrs. Kit
Thompson and Mrs. Jamie Carpenter
called forth loud applause.
A selection on the harp by Miss
Tanner Thompson as well as instru
mental composition of her own were
greatly enjoyed and complimented.
The recitations were especially fine
and showed great elocutionary tal
ent. "Somebody's Darling," was
splendidly and feelingly recited by
Mrs. Daisy Hunt. "Old Soapy," one
of the finest, temperance selections,
was recited by Miss Elizabeth Gentry
of Brodhead in one of the most pleas
ing and impressive ways we ever
heard. She is a fine speaker and re
ceived a medal at a contest on this
selection. "Kentucky Philosophy"
was splendidly rendered by Miss Tan
ner Thompson, who was recalled to
the stage and recited "Jemima's
Courtship," which was greatly ap
plauded. "Bill's In Trouble," was
very beautifully rendered by Mrs.
Willis. "The Rappahannock," by
Mrs. Anna Napier, and "The Ma
son's Secret," by Mrs. Buchanan, both
were greatly enjoyed and applauded
and the beautiful selection, "Laska,"
was finely rendered by Mrs. Newland
in her best elocutionary effort. She
is a fine speaker.
"Dixie," "Massa's In de Cold, Cold
Ground," "Auld Lang Syne," and
"Old Kentucky Home," were chorus
es sung by all the ladies. "Old
Black Joe," was sung. by Mrs. M. E.
Fish, Mrs. Bettie Bucnanan, Mrs. Al
lie Pettus, Mrs. Caltha Newland and

A RATHER EXPENSIVE "BUSS."
A dispatch from Frankfort says
that E. Webb, a teacher of Russell
county, fined $400 and sentenced to
100 days in jail for detaining and
kissing Fannie Carter, was pardoned
by the governor of the 100-day jail
sentence. Immediately following the
osculatory offense, Joe Carter, the
girl's father, beat Webb with his fists
cut him with ,a knife, shot him in the
hand and knocked him unconscious
with the butt of the revolver, and,
Webb declared, "called him out of
his name." The evidence showed
that Webb's intent went to further
than the kiss and the Governor
thought the punishment already re
ceived amply fit the crime.

Mrs. P. Rehkamp, 2404 Herman

of the Quantrell gang and was asso
ciated with the James boys, He was
the oldest of three brothers, sons of
Col. Harry W. Younger, who came
from Kentucky to Lee's Summit, Mo.,

man: "Samuel W. Wilhite, former
controller of the city of Louisville,
who has been in the reformatory
since October, 1914, serving a term
of from two to ten years for hypothe
cating bonds belonging to the city,
has renewed his application for a
pardon and Gov. Stanley has the case
under consideration. No action was
taken today, but the belief is general
that the Governor is giving the peti
tion favorable consideration and will
act on it this week. Letters and tel
egrams by the hundreds, supporting
the petition, accompanied the appli
cation. Acting Mayor Miller, of
Louisville, and the prosecuting officer
have given assurances that they will
not oppose the pardon, and Mayor
Buschemeyer, at Hot Springs, will be
communicated with.

The following games have so far
been scheduled:
March 31 Stanford vs. Huston-
-ville at StaniMrd.--. - -
April 1 Stanford vs. D. &"D. at
Danville.
April 8 Stanford vs. Mt. Vernon
at Mt. Vernon.
April 14 Stanford vs. Hustonville
at Hustonville.
April 21 Stanford vs. Centre Col
lege first team, at Stanford.
The dates for the return game of
the D. & D. and Mt. Vernon teams
have not yet been decided upon, but
will be played the early part of April.
It will no doubt seem strange to
many of the Stanford fans that the
first team of Centre College will play
the local team, as it has never been
customary for college and university
nines to schedule games with high
schools, but Centre is scheduled to
play the strong St. Mary's team the
following day, and arranged this
game with the local boys, in order to
be in tip top shape for their stronger
opponents.
The Domestic Science girls served
refreshments to the faculty of the
school Thursday afternoon.

8TH DISTRICT
POLITICIANS
Gossiping About Congressional Race
Considerably This Week Mont
gomery and Palmer Here.
Politics has been sizzling in the
Eighth Congressional district this
week. Frankfort and Louisville pa
pers have been predicting that Repre
sentative George L. Pickett, of Shel
by county, a brother of Mrs. Wm.
Severance, of this city, would an
nounce as a candidate for the demo
cratic nomination for congress this
week, and one Tuesday night State
Senator Charles F. Montgomery, of
Casey county, was In Stanford, con
ferring with several of his local
friends with regard to becoming a
candidate also. Congressman Har
vey Helm's friends say that he will
be a candidate for renomination, so
the race promises to be a three-cornered
affair if all predictions being
made come true.
The Frankfort State Journal, of
Wednesday, said that Mr. Pickett,
had been in Frankfort Tuesday and
stated that he would announce as a
candidate for congress either Thurs
day or Friday. In this connection,
the Louisville Times Thursday said:
"Speaking of Eighth district con
gressional politics, a Democrat who
knows what's what, said that the so
called Beckham-Haley bunch was be
hing Harvey Helm, the present con
gressman, and that Gov. Stanley and
the administration influences would
get back of Representative George L.
Pickett, of Shelby county. The Shel
by aspirant, it is said, has already
perfected the nucleus of a good or
ganization in nearly every county of
the district, which includes some
heretofore warm supporters of Con
gressman Helm."
In this connection the Louisville
Post had the following to say:
We notice in the Louisville Times
a prediction that "Governor Stanley
and the administration influences"
will get back of Mr. George L. Pick
ett, of Shelby county, in an effort to
defeat Congressman Harvey Helm in
the Eighth Congressional district.
This is a singular admission. Mr.
Stanley has enough to do at Frank
fort without seeking to choose Con
gressmen for the various districts of
the State. The Governor does not
reside in the Eighth district; the men
that he has appointed to State office
from that district would be much bet
ter employed discharging their ' offi
cial duties than in exerting them
selves to aid Mr. Stanley to defeat a
Congressman whom it appears he
does not like. The Evening Post has
no intention of offering advice to
the Democrats of the Eighth district,
as- tOMwipm-Jihepc-shduld' neminatgA,.! ;-r-r-Our
information, is. .that Mr. Helm has
made, and is making, an industrious,
successful representative. We know
nothing to the detriment of Mr.
Pickett. The point of the incident
is the attempt of "Governor Stanley
and administration influences" to try
to control the politics. They will at
tempt this in the coming state con
vention, and it is of the greatest im
portance to the party and the State
that attempted dictatorship of that
kind be rebuked.
Senator Montgomery told the I. J.
here Tuesday night that he has not
finally determined upon his course in
the matter, but that he will in all
probability decide to make the race.
He is now going over the district,
meeting with friends in different
counties and is receiving very grat
ifying assurances of support in the
event he decides to run. Senator
Montgomery has represented the dis
trict composed of Lincoln, Casey,
Boyle and Garrard counties in the
upper house of the state legislature
for four years and during that time
has made a splendid record as a law
maker. He has been consistently up
on the right side of practically ev
ery question that has come before the
legislature, being especially promi
nent in his fights to secure a vote on
state-wide prohibition, and other
measures in which the temperance
people of Kentucky are interested.
Senator Montgomery has been a
close friend of U. S. Senator J. C.
W. Beckham for many years, and
led his fight in Casey county and
that section, in the senatorial pri
mary of 1914. Senator Montgomery
was born in Lincoln county, being
the son of the Rev. J. Q. Montgomery
one of the most beloved ministers of
the Christian church in the state. He
also married in Lincoln, his wife be
ing a daughter of Col. T. L. Carpen
ter, of HustonyiHe.
Congressman Helm's friends say
that he is "sitting steady in the boat"
and is unperturbed by reports of the
opposition which seems to be in pro
cess of development against him. His
friends say he will ask nomination
and re-election upon the record he
has made during his long service in
congress, and that neither he nor
they have any fears of the outcome.
Considerable interest was aroused
here Tuesday also by the presence
here of Dr. N. A. Palmer, superin
tendent of the Anti-Saloon League of
Kentucky. Dr. Palmer has been con
siderably in the limelight in connec
tion with the work of the. recent leg
islature, Dr. Palmer paid high trib
ute to tre recovo made cy senator
Montgomery, of this district, who, he
said, was always a most consistent
and powerful friend of every tem
perance measure presented.
AN UNUSUAL SORT OF INJURY.
Miss Ida Freeman is suffering in- "
tense pain as a result of sticking a
needle in her finger while crocheting
abettt two weeks ago. At first Miss
Freeman paid little attention to the
injury, later the most intense pain
developed. Dr. Perry was called Fri
day and lanced the Member. Friends
of the young lady are hoping nothing
of a serious nature will follow.
