VOTEB—DABK HOBSE ELECT
ED IN THIBtD WABD
As the result of the city election
held last Tuesday Dr. G. M. A. Fortier
will serve as city mayor for another
year, Victor Schallern will again act
as city clerk, Frank Ellenbecker as
city assessor, J. W. Hatch as consta
ble, Geo. Moeglein, Sr., as alderman
at-large, and M. B. Blake as alderman
from the first ward. Elias Brown is
the new choice of the second ward,
Martin John from the third and Frank
Farrow from the fourth.
The election was, as predicted, a
quiet one, the vote being much 'below
that of last year. The total vote
polled was 864, of which 287 were
cast in the first ward, 228 in the sec
ond, 189 in the third and 16® in the
fourth.
As usual, the third ward, on the
West side, pulled off its stunt of elect
ing an alderman by the "dark horse"
method. Henry Peterson was a candi
date for re-eleetion and was defeated
by Martin John by a vote of 96 to
55. A large number of votes which
were presumbably intended for Mr.
John had to be thrown out as the voter
liad failed to mark a cross after the
name or had placed the sticker in the
wrong place.
Some of the friends of "Fat" Smith,
who was not on the ticket, gave him
a flattering vote in the First ward, al
though sprung as a josh.
The contest, between Dr. Fortier and
Is. N. Bergheim for the mayoralty was
the most interesting and the closest.
Fortier won by a margin of 47 votes.
He carried the first ward by 48 votes,
the second by one, and the fourth by
15. Bergheim carried the third ward
by 17 votes.
Following is the election table:

BOABD OF PUBLIC WOBKS
The board of public works met at
the city hall Wednesday evening.
Clerk Schallern was instructed to ad
vertise for bids for the cjnstruction
of the First street northeast sewer.
This is the sewer that the council or
dered constructed last fall, but for
which no bids were receive 1 at that
time. The sewer is to be one block
long and is an extension of the pres
ent sewer between Fourth and Fifth
avenues. April 14 was set as the date
for receiving bids on the constructioa
of this sewer.
No objections were registered
against the construction of the sewer
on Broadway east and adjournment
was therefore taken to next Wednes
day evening, March 29, when the board
will determine just what property will
be benefited by this sewer and dieter
mine whether the cost will exceed 25
per cent of the assessed value of the
abutting property. The clerk will
likely be instructed to advertise for
bids at that time as the board wants
to receive bids for the construction
of this sewer at the same time as the
other, on April 14.

"JEFF" HIGHWAY
The regular monthly meeting was
held Monday night by the Commercial
club. The attendance was rather
small but considerable business was
transacted.
The entertainment committc 3 report
ed that they were busy arranging for
another banquet,'to oe given some time
after Easter. The club voted to le'.ve
the money that remained from the last
(banquet in the hands of the committee,7
the reports on both banquets to be
made at a later date.
No definite report had been prepared
by the committee on membership as
they were, not ready to report but they
stated' that they were meeting with
the best of success.
The matter of paying the band the
balance of the money due for 1915 was
brought up. About $125 still remains
to be paid. The secretary was in
structed to write Barney Burton and
other members of the committee which
had charge of raising the money, in
regard to the matter.
Secretary Millard was instructed to
send postal cards to all members two
days before meetings so that the- may
know when they are to be held and

It was the opinion of the club that
the big thing that they should work
for this year is the Jefferson highway,
and to see that it is properly located
through Morrison county. Secretary
Millard was instructed to get in touch
with Mr. Wllkins of Wadena and oth
ers between Sauk Rapids and P?rk
Rapids and to keep in touch with
them regarding the highway. He was
also advised to send out 20 to 25 copies

may read and place the articles in the
local papers in their respective towns.

MIKYMn WN UY IKY WM
REFUSE TO MODIFY CLAIM THAT
THEY WILL CONTBOL NA
TIONAL DELEGATION
St. Paul Dispatch: Anti-Lynch mem
bers of the democratic party in Minne
sota refuse to surrender "or modify
their claim that thej will be in control
of the national delegation when it
gets down to the business of selecting
a national committeeman.
They insist that when the vote is
taken they will have a majority of
the delegation, through the defection
of some who were chosen by the state
conference and are therefore popularly
supposed to be Lynch men.
Delegates Not Instructed
The anti-Lynch men declare that the
conference did not instruct its dele
gates by resolution or otherwise, to
vote for F. B. Lynch as national com
mitteeman, and the delegates will be
violating no obligation if they vote for
some one else.
F. A. Pike, a member of the Ramsey
county anti-Lynch delegation which
was ousted from the state conference,
said today:
"The delegates recommended by the
state conference will not thank Lynch
for putting his tag on them, nor for
questioning their integrity, if they as
sert their independence of his. author
ity. The conference was called bv the
state, not the national organization,
and was declared to be a free forum
for all democrats.
Lynch Not Mentioned
"The name of Lynch was not men
tioned in its resolutions, its instruc
tions or its public addresses. The can
didates it recommended for delegates
were in no way pledged or bound to
vote for F. B. Lynch. Yet E. J. Lynch
now asserts that every one of these
men is tied hand and foot to the Lynch
juggernaut and is liable to condemna
tion if he so much as imagines the po
litical death of the boss."

SAMUEL LOBD OF TAX COMM3S
SION GIVES INSTRUCTIVE
$'. TALK
The assessors of the county held
ft meeting at the court house yester
day afternoon for the purpose of con
ferring with the tax commission in re
gard to their duties under the laws
1 the state.
Mr. Lord, chairman of the eommis
n, was present and explained fully
of the laws governing an assessor's
ies. He reminded them that they
had taken an oath to perform their
duties in accordance with the. laws of
the state and urged them to be true
to this solemn obligation. He said
that tax paying can probably never
be made a pleasant duty but if tax
payers could feel fairly certain that
their tax money was honestly handled
and wisely spent, and that the proper
ty of their neighbors was assessed/ the
same as their own we would probably
hear less murmuring and fewer com
plaints.
"The assessment laws of the state
now require that household goods and
wearing apparel shall be assessed at
25 per cent of their true and full value
in money merchandise, farm products,
live' stock, machinery of all kinds and
farm lands at 33 1-3 per cent of their
value and all other property, includ
ing platted village and city real es
tate, and bank stock at 40 per cent of
its full value.
"It is so clear that it is self-evident
that if the property of every taxpayer
in every taxing district in the state
was placed on the assessment books
and valued according to the same
rule the result would be a fair and
uniform assessment all over the state
and this is just what will happen if
the property of every citizen is as
sessed according to law. We are in
sisting, therefore, that the law must
be carried out (by every assessor just
as it is written.
The opinion is quite prevalent
throughout the state that in some way
not clearly understood the assessor is
responsible for high taxes. Taxes are
unquestionably high but the assessor
has had no more to do with making
them so than any other citizen. The
duty of the assessor is simply to value
thp property upon which taxes are
levied. The assessment is simply a
factor to determine how much each
person shall contribute to the expense
of government, but it does not deter
mine the amount of the tax. It is the
amount of money that is voted! for
public purposes that determines wheth
er taxes shall be high or low. Large
appropriations mean high taxes. When
a community is spending large amounts
of money—it matters not what for—
tj»es will inevitably, be high bu$ the
^VSsessof as an officer' has absolutely
nothing to say about how much money
shall be spent. The amount of money
to be raised by taxation is determined
•bv town meetings, school meetings, vil
lage and city councils, county boards,
the legislature, and by the people
themselves—not by the assessor.
"There, will be raised in this state
this year by direct taxation for school,
road, local, county and state purposes
the enormous sum of $52,000,000.
Whether the assessor aoes his work
well or whether he does it poorly, and
whether he lists all of the property in
his district or only a part of it, prac
tically all of this very large amount
of money will be raised just the same.
Except as to a very small fraction of
this amount nothing that the assessor
tan do will add to or subtract from it
a single penny.
But while the assessor has practi
cally nothing to do with making the
taxes of a community high or low he
has nearly everything to do with mak
ing them fair audi just. From the
standpoint of the individual taxpayer
he is the most important officer who
has anything to do with taxation. If
he complies with his oath of office and
does his work in the way that the law
provides, approximate justice will pre
vail among all of the taxpayers of his
district but if on the other hand he
departs from the standard fixed by
law, or if he omits any considerable
amount of property from his list his
assessment will inevitably abound! in
the grossest inequalities and result in
the rankest injustice. Taxpayers whose
property is not all listed and assessed
will pay less than their share, and tax
payers whose property is all assessed
will pay .more than they ought to.
"In nearly every commnnity tax
dodging is resorted to most by people
who are best able to pay. It is not
the citizen of limited means whose
property is all in sight and easily
found by the assessor who escapes.
Such people as a rule pay taxes on
every dollar's worth of property they
have in the world. It is among peo
ple with bulging pocket-books where
we find our flagrant tax dodgers. Many
of these people by one dishonest de
vice or another evade every tax that
they safely can. It is this class of
citizens that make the burden of tax
ation harder than it should be for hon
est taxpayers because all taxes which
by trickery and dishonest methods tax
dodgers get out of paying must be
made up by the less favored and more
honest taxpayers of the county.
"The tax commission will aid as
sessors by every means in its power to
enforce the law against this class of
citizens and when a false statement 'by
a taxpayer is called to our attention
?e will see that the matter is placed
in the hands of the county attorney
for prosecution.^ Much can be done
by assessors to prevent tax dodging
if they will perform their duties fear
lessly and diligently and in strict ac
cordance with law.
"If honest taxpayers eould only be
brought to realize that the only, way
their rights can be safeguarded and a
square deal for everybody obtained
is by a full listing and legal assess
ment of all property in their district,
tax dodging instead of being regarded
as a harmless game of wits in which
the strong, the resourceful, and the
greedy nearly always win would be re-

garded as a crime and dealt with ac
cordingly. If good citizens fully un
derstood that tax dodging in nine
cases out of ten simply meant that
well to do citizens were casting their
tax burdens upon their less favored
brethren, tax dodging would become
edious and a tax dodger, if discover
ed^ would become an object of con
tempt in every community.
Taxes have become so high in
many communities that they are a
great burden to citizens of moderate
means. There has been a noticeable
tendency in recent years toward very
large public expenditnres,- and it be
hooves every good citizen and every
taxpayer of moderate means in such
communities to scrutinize ail public
expenditnres closely and to think
twice before lending their support to
any new public enterprise—no matter
how .attractive it may seem. The thing
to be considered by people of moder
ate means in such communities is not
so much whether a proposed new
building or improvement is a good
thing in itself or not ibut father one
of whether they can really afford? to
have anything added to twBir already
heavy burdens."

HIGHWAY WILL BE PUT IN FIRST
CLASS SHAPE BY THE FIBST
OF JULY ,v
Another assurance that what
will be one of the main trav
eled roads in Morrison coun
Jefferson Highway, will be put in first
class shape the coming summer, meets
with the approval of everyone and
will be welcomed. Andrew Herum of
Randall, county commissioner, has
stated that the road between Little
Falls and Staples, in this county, will
be completed and put in first class
shape by the first or July, 1916. This
will strengthen our hold on the high
way and knocks out the argument of
the towns which are trying to change
the route on the grounds that .this
route takes in such bad roads. The
stretch between this city and Staples
is the only bad one and when it is fixed
up the route through Morrison county
will be all that one could desire.
Following is the commissioner's'let
ter to Mr. Millard, secretary of the
Little Falls Commercial club, in regard
to the fixing of the road:
(Copy)
"Little Falls, Minn., March 22.
"Mr. R. B. Millard,
Little Falls, Minn.
"Dear Sir:
"The road between Cushing and
Lincoln that you asked me about
the other day will be in condition,
for travel by the first of July. I
am planning to put on two crews
of men and rush the work through.
As you know, this is a part of the
Jefferson Highway as designated
by the State Highway Commis
sion.
"You can assure the commission
or anyone who asks you that this
strip of road will be finished dur
ing the early summer of 1916 and
put in splendid condition for the
through traffic.
"As you know I am a booster
for good roads and am as anxious
as any one that' this road be put
in high grade condition early in
the summer and maintained that
way.
'Yours for good roads,

County Commissioner.''

TWO PRISONERS AT COUNTY
JAIL CAUGHT TBYING TO
MAKE GETAWAY
An attempt on the part of two pris
oners in the county bastile to break
jail on Monday night was nipped in
the bud by the timely arrival of Sher
iff Paul Felix on the scene. The sher
iff saw the men working at the win
dow but they ran upstairs when he en
tered the jail. F. E. Johnson, held on
a charge of bigamy, and who has since
been taken away by the Clay county
authorities, and E. A. Croker, serving
a 25-day. sentence for securing money
under false pretenses, were immediate
ly suspected, and the latter is now be
ing deprived the privilege of occupy
ing the corridors of the jail.
Sheriff Felix locks the. prisoners in
their cells' every night but on Mon
day night he came home much later
than usual and the men had not yet
