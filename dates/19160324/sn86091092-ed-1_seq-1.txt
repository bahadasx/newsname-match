BLOOD WILL FLOW
RED ON THE DIAMOND
A married man has peculiar tii^its.
For instance, when the sun shines {or
a few consecutive days he imagines
that he is as an athlete of no little
prowess. He struts about emitting
strange and terrifying noises anent
his ability as a' baseball player and
explains to the younger generation
how they used to do it in "the days
of 49."
"Boys in the good old days," he de
clares, "we used to make more runs
in a game and lose it than the win
ning teams in these mollycoddle days
of baseball are able to accumulate in
a week. The younger generation is
too lenient, it does not smite the ball
as it should be smote. And to demon
strate that we are sincere in our be
lief nine exponents—our wives con
senting—of real baseball will gather
at Recreation Park next Sunday af
ternoon at 2:30 ready and anxious to
contest with any set of persons, bach
elors preferred for the baseball su
premacy of the beautiful city of Cald
well."
Needless to say the single bucks
accepted the challenge and as a result
oodles of rich red blood will flow
freely.
Mrs. Rumor has it that included in
the array of brilliant talent to be pre

RAPID INCREASE IN THE
FLOW OF BOISE RIVER
Arrowrock Reservoir Rises Four Feet
From Monday to Tuesday Morning
The water level in Arrowrock reser
voir raised four feet between 9 o'clock
Mondlay morning and 9 o'clock Tues
day morning and is still rising, in
view of the) rapid rise, the Boise pro
ject officials decided to hold enough
water in the reservoir to raise the
level above the higher gates and let
the water act as a protection against
frost. Up to date, the effort was to
keep the water below the gates, so
as to avert danger from frost or ice.
At noon on Tuesday two thousand
second feet of water was liberated,
the intention being tot hold the reser
voir below the higher gate level.
When it was found that so much
water was coming into the reservoir
that the release of two thousand sec
ond feet would not suffice to hold
down the level, the decision was
reached to let the water come up
above the gates.
Reservoir Levels.
The bed of the Boise river at Ar
rowrock is 2956 feet above sea level.
The water surface in the reserv"oir
was 3103 feet above sea level at 9
o'lcock Tuesday morning, having
risen from 3099 feet during the pre
vious 24 hours. The center line of
the higher gates is 3105 feet above
sea level, and the present intention
is to raise the water level in the
reservoir to 3110 feet above sea level.
The crest of the Arrowrock dam spill
way is 3205 feet above sea level.
Increased Flow.
On Monday morning the natural
flow of the Boise river, below More's
oreek, was 5600 second feet, which
was increased to 7000 second feet 24
hours kiter. Out of that, 1060 sec
ond feet is being diverted into the
main canal for storage in Deer Flat
reservoir. Up to the present the main
canal has been carrying- 600 second
feet. Deer Flat reservoir is now ap
proximately one-third full, containing
about fifty thousand acre feet. Ar
rowrock reservoir also contains about
fifty thousand acre feet, but this
amount will be materially increased
when the water level is raised five
feet above the center of the higher
gates.
Controlling Run-off.
The contour of Arrowrock reservoir
is such that the surface area increases
rapidly with the rise of the surface
level. The intention of the Boise pro
ject officials is to save as much stor
age capacity as possible for the big
flood run-off which is certain to come
this spring. The natural flow of the
river above Arrowrock at the present
time is about seven thousand second
feet. The greatest amount of water
the river has ever carried past the
city, so far as the records show, was
thirty-two thousand second feet. That
flow, of course, caused damage in
Boise. It is to protect the city from
possible damage by flooding that the
reclamation officials are deferring the
storage of water, in order that reser
voir capacity may be available when
it is needed for protection. There is
no concern about filling the reservoir.
The object is to fill it gradually and
keep the river below down to a safe
level, which is being accomplished.
Ice is Rotting.
While the ice on the surface of the
Arrowrock reservoir is thick, it is rot
ting rapidly and a strong wind would
probably break it up. To keep the
ice from clogging the gates is the
problem the officials have to deal
with and thus far they have succeed
ed admirably.

PREPAREDNESS WAVE
STRIKES LOCAL COMPANY
Company G, the local company of
the National Guard, is taking steps
that will insure greater efficiency.
Some trouble has been had with cer
tain men of the company who have
made attendance to drill a matter of
convenience entirely, thereby placing
a serious obstacle in the way of proper
training of the company.
A month .or so ago the commanding
officer of the company issued an order
calling for strict attendance to drill
and, in order that no hardship be im
posed, allowed three unexcused ab
sences from drill before taking any
action. Any man wishing to be ex

tion the fact to the commanding offi
cer and the permission was freely
granted.
Wednesday evening the first Sum

JURT FINDS ROBERTS
NOT GUILTY OF
JURY WHICH TRIED CASE RE
FUSE TO PLACE ANY CONFI
DENCE IN TESTIMONY OF
GUMSHOERS.
Prosecuting Attorney Griffiths Moves
That Case Against Hall be Dismiss
ed—People Generally Expected this
Result after Hearing Evidence in the
Case—Wells Attends Court.
The jury found A. L. Roberts of
Payette not guilty in the district court
Monday. Mr. Roberts was charged
with the illegal sale of intoxicating
liquors. Tuesday morning Pflosecut
ing Attorney H. A. Griffiths moved
that the charge against John Hall of
the same city and accused of the same
offence be dismissed. Messrs. Rob
erts and Hall were represented by
Attorney J. H. Norris of Payette.
The prosecution depended upon
the evidence of H. E. Bradley and
wife to secure the conviction. Brad
ley and wife are gumshoers and the
jury refused to accept their conflicting
evidence as grounds for conviction.
Bradley and wife were brought to
Caldwell from Montpelier to testify
in this case. Their testimony through
out conflicted with the testimony they
offered at the preliminary hearing in
these cases.
The case against A. L. Roberts,
proprietor of a pool hall at Payette
started Monday. The original venire
of 24 jurors was exhausted and a spe
cial venire of five talesmen was called
in torder to fill out the jury. Those on
the jury were Fred Hultz, A. H. Al
bertson, B. Dix. John F. McClure, Jo
seph Swartz, Jay R. Lonkey, J. B.
Durham, L. T. Eaton, Carl Eisinmen
ger, O. C. Robison, Charles G. Baker,
and James Church.
As the trial began it became evident
that the prosecution's case rested al
most entirely on the evidence given
by H. E. Bradley and his wife, under
stood to have been engaged by the
Payette city authorities to secure evi
dence of bootlegging operations. Tes
timony brought out the fact that the
sleuths were to obtain approximately
$50 for each case they were able to
work up. It is stated that their bill
£or such work accomplished has been
presented to the Payette council and
amounts to something over $40.00.
Purchase Booze.
The Bradleys testified that they
conducted a restaurant in Payette.
Roberts was a patron of their estab
lishment. On October 23, they claim
ed, Roberts, in response to a request
made to him through a third party, D.
L. Dean, brought into their restaurant
and delivered to Mr. Bradley a pint
of whisky. In return they testified
to having paid Roberts $1.
Visitors Present.
There were present during the trial
of the case many persons from Pay
ette. Superintendent Wells of the An
ti-Saloon league was also an interest
ed spectator. The verdict of the jury
meets with the greatest public approv
al. Expressions of approval were
heard on all Sides Tuesday. No one
outside of the prosecution thought
that the unsubstantiated testimony of
Bradley and wife would procure con
viction. A great many people were
keenly disappointed LÎiat the prosecu
tion had not a stronger case.
Some criticism was indulged in that
Bradley and wife should have been
brought here at an expense of $187.00
to testify in these cases when it was
known that there was no substantial
ing evidence. It is stated that the
mileage for Bradley and wife was not
allowed.

HARDENBURG TRIAL MAY
BE CONTINUED FOR TERM |
Attorney Must Make Showing by End
of Present Week.
Ernest B. Hardenburg may not be
tried for murder at the present term
of the district court. Whether his
trial for the murder of Samuel Rich
ardson on a ranch south of Nampa
the evening of March 1, will take place
is yet to be determined. Hardenburg
was arraigned-before Judge Ed L.
Bryan Monday morning and a plea of
not guilty was entered. Attorneys for
the defense immediately moved for a
continuance of the trial over this term.
Later in the day Judge Bryan notified
the prisoner's counsel that they must
makë their showing in support of their
motion before the end of the present
week.
Delay Anticipated.
That the case will not come to trial
during the present term is the belief
of attaches about the courthouse. It
is reported that Hardenburg's attor
neys wish time in which to secure den
ositions from distant points. If this
is the object for which they are to
contend, it is thought the necessary
time will be granted them.
Charles L. Meyers, held for grand
larceny on the accusation of having
stolen a horse and other property near
the station of Falk, in this county,
was arraigned before Judge Bryan
Monday morning. The prisoner, still
without counsel, pleaded not guilty.
His trial will occur during the present
term.
GOOD ADVTCE TO
THE LOCAL PREACHERS
Caldwell has now her full quota of
preachers, each of the popular
churches having a good man. The
Hired Man sends these ministers his
greetings and extends a little fatherly
advice. This particular region has
more use for a poor warm man than
for a wise frigid one. One of the
weakest preachers Caldwell ever had
was the best collector, the rapidest
builder-up. the best loved man, the
longest rememebered. Your hearers
out here are a sort of mixture be
tween the cayuse and the Percheron.
We have just enough sedateness in
us to make us worth while and just
enough of the Pinto to make us rora
pish. They tell some pretty hard
jokes on some of us about not having
the Simon pure article when it comes
to religion, but you will find quite
good material here and there. Just
give us Sunday after Sunday the story
of Jesus carrying his cross about with
him. Never mind which of you gets
the biggest crowd. We go to Can
yon hill one by one and not in
bunches. We want that kind of
preaching which will stop us in our
mad rush for perpetual motion money.
Everyone of us went into debt for
land to raise alfalfa or in order to
buy more land on which to raise more
alfalfa, with which to buy more land
on which to raise more alfalfa. Tell
us something that will make a knot
come under the front collar button,
and a tear or two chase down cheeks
made to blush with recollection of
our sins, and if you don't get the peo
ple to come out to hear you, let them
stay at home. Now if you have some
suggestions for the folk that you do
not want to print over your own
name, just hint them to the Hired
Man and see how soon they will be
out. We want good mixers, but yet
after all, the man who has joshed and
fummed about with us all the winter,
doesn't have the real weight with us
when death is feeling for the cords of
our heart, that the earnest plodder
has, for whom we may have even en
tertained thoughts of dislike some
times when the red blood was rushing
through our veins, but who now looks
forth good through the glassy film
coming over the eyes.
There was a real quiet woman came
over to our house the other day and
began to talk to the Hired Man's wife
about the woman who brings them
their butter. I don't know what this
butter woman's name is, and I don't
care to tell wlto the one is who did the
talking, but here is what was said:
"The woman is a pleasing, stout crea
ture, cleanly and polite. The butter
is put up in elegant condition, wrap
ped in beautiful white papers, the
basket right out of the band-box. and
the woman's clothes clean enough for
a parlor entertainment. The gossiper
at our house, and may her tribe in
crease. could not tell us enough about
how safe they felt when, cutting off a
chunk of butter delivered by a wo
man such as that. The Hired Man
has a sister-in-law who won't touch
a bite of butter. She says she once
saw a big butter vat cleaned out and
there was a sight. I tell her that all
the debris is better taken out than
left in the butter, but then my logic
does not influence her in the least. I
do not remember ever having seen
the last in the bottom of a butter-milk
pitcher in the summer time that did
not have a fly or something else un
drinkable in it, but a man ought to
really love his country sufficienty to
eat a little bit of it when necessary. It
is difficult to have cold string beans
without finding a fly in them.
The other day the Hired Man in
these columns made James Hartley a
brother of H. K. Hartley. What was
really meant, was that they had the
same sort of good timber in them,
were brothers in pioneer honesty.
Anybody who can show that kind of
Hartley blood is of a good sturdy
stock.
Mrs. C. J. Atchison entertains the
Thursday Night club at her home to
night. The regular meeting night was
changed on account of the lecture
course number, which occurred last
evening.
GAS WELL DISCOVERED
ON NI'« RANCH
AT
FARMERS LIVING IN VICINITY
OF DISCOVERY STAKE OUT
MANY CLAIMS—TOWNS
PEOPLE INTERESTED
Prospects That Gas and Oil in Com
mercial Quantities May be Discov
ered—Discovery Made While Drill
ing Well for Water—Thorough In
vestigation Will be Made.
The people of Caldwell were greatly
interested in a pas well discovered on
the ranch of J. F. Mclntyre at River
side, 13 miles west of Caldwell. While
sinking a well on the Mclntyre place
the latter part of last week u flow of
gas was struck at a depth of 112 feet.
As the flow has continued uninterrupt
edly since, some significance is attach
ed to the discovery.
On Sunday a score or more of Cald
well citizens journeyed to the well.
They found it still spouting the color
less, odorless gas. The flow is not
particularly strong, but when a match
is applied the flame burns fairly
steadily to a height of about 3 feet.
Well is Shallow.
Since the gas has been found at
such an uncommonly shallow depth,
many believe that by sinking the shaft
several hundred feet lower a valuable
flow may be obtained. It is explained,
howeve that the well is located on
low land and in a depression of the
Snake river valley. To reach the
same stratum it would be necessary,
even comparatively short distances
away, to drive a well between 500 and
600 feet deep, say those who have vis
ited the saene.
Mr. Mclntyre is quoted as saying
that he thinks the present gas flow
from the well would light and heat
his own and a number of other homes
of the ncigborhood.
Ranchers Grab Claims.
Ranchers of the Riverside section
are said to have taken Up all the avail
able claims in that immediate vicinity,
in the hope that developments may
prove the property valuable. One of
the good indications found in connec
tion with the well is said to be the
fact that a stratum of sand was pferced
just before the gas flow was struck.
So far as known, rto concerted move
has vet been made looking toward
development of the Mclntyre well or
or additional wells, but it seems cer
tain that if the flow from the existing
shaft does not fizzle out, further pros
pecting will be tried.
BARBERS OF CALDWELL
ARE OF HIGH CLASS
Things change a good deal in 35
years. When the Hired Man was 15
years old. the barbers were consider
ed a very common sort of folks. If
some man's nice daughter was likely
to marry one of the brood, she start
ed no end of adverse talk. Just what
a first rate girl wanted with a barber
was more than madam gossip could
understand. In Caldwell today the
barbers rank well with any other pro
fession for citizenship and household
respectability. I do not know that
any paper has ever before thought of
it, but where is there a scrub or runt
among all the Caldwell barbers? You
used to need to hide your blush ap
paratus before entering the average
barber shop, or else overwork it on
the indecent talk. Today the tongue
of the barber is as clean as that of the
average costumer. Thirty-five years
since every saloon man was a Demo
crat. You did not have to debate the
matter a moment, he was a Demo
crat if he were a saloon keeper. To
day the saloon keepers are nearly all
Republicans. Thirty-five years ago,
in my bailiwick, a printer was shelved
when the real elite society came
around. Today the Caldwell squad is
a fair representation of the fraternity,
and there is not a maverick among
them. Of course they, at large, still
have on their list that floating gang,
but the Hired Man is speaking espec
ially for tlfe gentlemen who live in
Caldwell and follow printing for a
livelihood.
hired man passes
on drainage scheme
The Hired Man has had it put up
to him to say something about the
city draining the north side lowlands
within its confines. The Hired Man
don't think the city ought to do that
draining at all, but that the property
owners over there should do their
own improvements. The lowland re
gion ought to be drained of course,
just as other sections of the city
needed sewers that were charged to
continguous property. The citv might
give the property owners a year or
two to do the work, and if then un
done, the city might compel them to
do it. Of course the lands were low
before this was a city, but this was a
citv before the present owners got
hold of the property, and besides it
isn't right for the city to have to do
the work that property owners ought
to do. If property owners maintain
anything that is a nuisance to the
city, there is a way to handle it.
The Forward club met Monday af

for the meeting of the Second district,
which convenes here on May 15.
