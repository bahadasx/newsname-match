sy LOUISE OLIVER.
Papa Moffatt, choleric and as well
Upholstered as the heavy davenport
upon which he sat, looked up from I
the evening paper. "Well, it looks as
though people were learning sense.
Woman suffrage has been turned down A
in our state," he chuckled.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" exclaimed Dorothy.
dutifully doing nothing by the after
dinner lamp. "The girls have worked t
'so hard." c
"Hard! What do women know about
work?" demanded her father, who
spent four hours in his office every day
just for the looks of the thing. "Poli
tics would be a nice mess with women
in it. J tell you women haven't and
never will have the brains of men."
Dorothy, seeing an opportunity,
struck while the iron was hot. "Then,
dad, if you like men so well why do
you object to me having company or
going anywhere with a man?"
Mrs. Moffatt looked up from her
crocheting horrified. The affair of the
Blackmore's nephew, who had visited
his relatives and managed to make
Dorothy fall in love with him-to the
righteous rage of Papa Moffatt, who
was away on a trip at the time-was
a subject religiously avoided by the
family. For papa possessed a temper
erratic as Vesuvius and as dangerous
as a mine. A mere touch and it was
off.
Dorothy's remark went home. The
mine exploded. "So you think, miss,
that because I came home in time to
prevent some young whelp from run
ning off with you that you are privi
leged to be sarcastic the rest of your
life. It's a good thing for him he
made that train or I'd be in jail now
for murder."
"But, dad, you never even saw him.
It isn't fair to judge people before-"
"That's enough, young lady. Do
you think I've spent money on you all
your life to teach you music and paint
ing and goodness knows what Just to
have some young rascal of a nobody
steal you? Besides, you're too young.
I want you right here at home to be
company for ma and me till you're
twenty-five or thirty. And when you
get married Ill pick your husband.
Women haven't any brains. I'm glad
they didn't let 'em vote."
Still snorting and puffing his cheeks,
.r Papa Moffatt resumed his paper.
Dorothy, sobbing louder than occa
sion demanded, left the room and went
to bed, presumably. In reality, the
tears dried up miraculously as soon
as her door was shut. She got out
an immense packet of thick letters
addressed to General Delivery and re
read every one with flushed cheeks
and shining eyes. "Bertie, dear, there
will be some way. I'm going to think
harder than I ever did in my life. 'No
brains,' papa says. Look out, dad!"
"Where's Dolly?' asked Papa Mof
fat at breakfast.
"She-she has a headache. She
didn't sleep all night," said mamma.
Papa tried hard not to look like the
criminal he felt His moments of re
morse accounted for many of the
wonderful things Dolly now possessed.
He looked over his mail. "By George,
Katie. rye got to go to New York to
night. rye just had a letter from
McConnell. Have my bag ready, will
you, and dinner at six Instead of sev
en Tell Dolly to think up what she
wants to cure her headache."
So he departed, and Mrs. Moffat
flew to Dorothy with the news. Doro
thy grew thoughtful and helped her
self to another roll (she was having
a very comfortrble breakfast in bed)
with no more headache than I have
at this minute. Something she want
ed! She would make the price high.
So Papa Moffatt found two bags
waiting in the hall when he returned,
and a trunk besides. Dorothy,
dressed for traveling, met him smil
ing. "Sach a good daddy!" coaxed
Dolly sweetly. "Mamma told me you
said I could have what I wanted, so
I decided rd take a trip this time.
Tou are so good to me. I'm going to
New York with you."
Her father had not meant exactly
Sthat, but he dared not refuse. "Well,
I guess maybe-all right, come along,
DolL Don't know what '11 do with
youa, but if you want to go, I guess
you may. All ready?"
"Yes, daddy," demurely.
So 7:30 fouond them in a Pullman,
seeding estward
"Let's go to the St. Martin," sug
gested Dorothy in the morning.
"WelL" hesitated her father. I al
ways go to the Manhanset, but if you
want the other, it's all right"
So to the St. Martin it was.
They engaged rooms and Mr. Mof
tatt looked hurriedly at his watch.
"I have a meeting at ten, Dorothy.
Now about you-you can't go around
alone. I wonder if we can get some
ese to go with you."
"Let's ask the young man at the
desk. daddy."
The yonag man, very good looking,
very obliging and very much interest
ed in Dorothy, thought he knew a way.
"1 have a sister." he said, "who would
be able to go with Miss Mofratt, per
bas. We have a apasrtmmt tin lar
la , 11 ca1 her uap."
So tt was arranged that during her
r threeday stay Dorathy was to have a
compalon hle Papa Mofftt was
brsy with a deal of Sarst bamail tm
portaes *swhera
aO the evenhingl the rst day while
Dorothy was dreassn br dinner sad
theater later, Mr. Mer. aptt pasred in
i the oYb ad s ere up to the
-k. Te 7 m m was stm m
. ;t:l ug t be. Sm thy
wes amsd a semer abt P
Moffatt had had hd s appetizer and was
feeling the glow. He fairly radiated
good will.
"Pretty long hours, eh, young man?"
"Not so bad I'm off in a few min
utes now Did your daughter enjoy
hen1 day?"
"Yes, yes, much obliged to you."
"Oh, don't mention it. If you don't
mind my saying so, she's uncommonly
good-looking."
Papa chuckled. "You bet she Is.
And I tell you I have a time keeping
her from getting away from me. I'm
roini to keep her for a while--keep
her for a while." He put his finger
tips together and leaned confidently
over the desk. Las, time I was here
she nearly eloped with a young rascal
back home-so this time I brought
her along."
The young man looked sympathetic,
then sighed. "I'd like to get married
myself' But it costs so darn much to
live I just can't,"
Mr. Moffatt looked interested. Ro
mance always is thrilling it the daugh
ter is not yours. "Too bad. You seem
to have it pretty comfortable here."
"Oh, it's a.l right-only the girl's
used to everything and her people
would make a row."
"That is too bad. Well, save all
you can and invest in something good.
That's my motto. It's the only way to
get rich quick."
"I have saved." was the quick an
swer. "but the thing is to get the in
side track on something good. No one
cares to give me a tip."
Now it happened that the young
man knew exactly what papa's busi
ness was in New York, and wasn't it
clever of him to bleat to the right per
son? The other picked him right up
and gathered him into the fold. Put'
ting one finger against his nose and
shutting one eye, he leaned quite
close. "Buy Valparaiso Special 7's and
8's first thing in the morning. It's
mine, I tell you, but keep it quiet!
Hello, Dolly! Ready? Good-by, young
man." And in a loud whisper: "May
be her old man won't mind it so much
if you're rich."
The third day and last of New York
was a busy one for papa, but when he
got back to the hotel before dinner
Dorothy had not returned. He went
downstairs to inquire, but his young ,
friend was also absent from the desk.
The clerk in his place said he was
away for a few days, and, remember
ing something, handed the anxious
patron a letter. It was from Dorothy.
"Dear Daddy: Bert and I are on our
honeymoon. I hesitated to tell you
that he was the young man I've al
ways liked. Wasn't it odd to find him
here? And you were a darling to tell
him about Valparaiso Specials. He
cleared several thousand dollars on
your tip. You're such a good daddy.
I've bought such lovely clothes for my
wedding. We were afraid tq ask you,
but it was very quiet, anyway. Beo
sides, you mid I could have anything
I wanted, and it happened to be a
husband this time. Lovingly. Dorothy.
"P. S.-How about women voting?
Do you still think we haven't any
brains? Yess up, dad. You may as
well be sweet about it.-D."

New Scientiflo Achievement.
The production of resistances for
electric heating is a new application
of the Schoops metal-quirting pistoL
It is the resistance of metal conduo
tors to the passage of the current that
produces electric heat, and a common
form of resistance is a fine spiral wire
of copper, nickel and manganese on a
heat-resisting base. In the Prometheus
resistance, very thin films of the noble
metals are deposited on mica by a
special process. The squirting pistol .
uses any kind of metal and projects
the finely divided particles with suc
velocity that they form a coherent
coating on the body they strilke. At
works in Zurich resistances are made
with thick or thin films of metal on
a foundation of earthenware, clay ori
slate. The metal may be projected Ia
a zigzag upon this base, but the plan
seems to be preferred of covering the
entire surface and then tfusig away
by electric current a certain portion
of the coating. The zigrag condactor
forms a very efecient resistance. For
ordinary heating, such alloys as com
stantan, German silver and a combiw
tion of chromium and nickel are suit
able, and for the temperatares re
quired in the laboratory, platinum or
iridium may be used.
Orievanoes.
The most trifling thing is enough to
breed a kind of vague uncomfortable
feeling, which waxing daily more anad
more grievous, and fotered on all
Smannei of real or smaglinary disgusts,
at length ends in thorough alienation.
An intoltrable law has been satisfac
torily established, which produces
sweats and tinges and wincing for
months and years after. And a friead
ship that has perished in this way
scarcely ever comes to life again. A
friend lost by excessrive heat may es
I ily be restored, but if you have lost him
by an excessive coolnaes of slow sa
aeemingly inexplicable growth, the
chances are stro agat~anst a renewal
of the old liking. This reiectloa almo
might make mean more caretl thas
they are about opeulg the tiniest bhole
to a feeling of asgrleveanas It i
the letttg out of waterms whLeh may
probably never be mgathered ln aga.
