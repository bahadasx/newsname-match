News Received with Grave Concern
by Funston and Staff.- Rumor
Unconfirmed. Action Would ,
Complicate International 1
Situation
San Antonio, Tex., March 22.
Even though unconfirmed, the report
that General Luis Herrera, command
ing 2,000 men at Chihuahua, had
alingned himself with Francisco Villa
against the United tSates was receiv
ed with grave coneern by General
Funston and staff. The long inter
vals between General Pershing's re
ports already had keyed the tension
a bit, although General Funston and
his chief of staff continued to profess
the belief that all was weli:4-ith the
troops below Casas Grandes, but the
report from Chihuahua made insig
nificant any anxiety they might have
felt concerning Gereral Pershing's
operations .
Officially and unofficially the opin
ion here was that if Herrera has join
ed Villla the international situation
easily might be made so complex that
by comparison the pursuit of Villa
would be regarded as incidental.
Consul Beltran of Carranza's gov
ernment received no report of the re
ported revolt of Herrera and he was
inclined to laugh at it a "border rum
or." According to the version reach
ing here, Herrera was removed Mon
day from command and immediately
took steps to alienate his garrison.
