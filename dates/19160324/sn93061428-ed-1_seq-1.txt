Tyrone, N. M., Mar. 15, 1916.
Sunday some friends took me down
to Columbus, N. M., where Villa
made the attack. It is only about
seventy-five miles from here. We
went via Iteming. The sights were
pitiful.

doors three quite near each other,

would imagine resulting from such a
conflagration. The soldiers told us
in detail about the attack. We were
shown two of Villa's soldiers they
hnd in captivity; one a captain, the
other a spy condemned to be shot.
They were sweeping manure off the
street. They, the soldiers, aleo took
us to the place where they had burn

I will send them over to you to look

excusable attack.
All accounts in the Kl Paso papers
were true, neither over nor under

Naturally all possible preparedness
is being centered in Columbus, t rje ill
fated town, lying only two and one
half miles from the border.
Aeroplanes, tiuinloMds of supplies
nnd ammunitions are traveling there
dully. Unless the resident Mexicans
should stir up trouble here in this
camp, we fear no other attack. But
many fear war is inevitable.
They are carefully guarding the
Armory in Silver City. Denting is
protected with soldiers it being only
thirty-four miles from Columbus.
Don't think Villa will return to the
United States soon as he is believed
to be in hiding.
About two hundred made the raid
on Columbus and he had fifteen hun
dred more for re-inforcements only
twenty miles away. Villa, himself,
pave orders from a little green house
just out of Columbus. 1 wouldn't
take anything for that trip. The
attack was made about four in the
morning. All American women and
children were ordered out on Fri
day. We are hoping it may keep
quiet here. Don't worry, for we will
take no risks knowingly,

El Paso, March 22. Felix Mar
tines, one of the wealthiest and most
prominent citizens of El Paso, died
at his home in this city at 4:20
o'clock this afternoon after an ill
ness of about a week from pneu
monia. The condition of Mr. Martinet be
came critical during the day Tues
day, and physicians held nut little
hope for hi" recovery. His death
this afternoon, while sudden, was not
unexpected in view of the develop
ments In the progress of the disease.
The funeral will be held in El Paso
Friday, according to an announce-
1
mcnt made from the Martincr. home
tonight.
Tho death of Felix Martinet re
moves from the stage of life one of
the really noted figures of the south
west and one who hus played a con
spicuous part in the development of
this section. As a statesman and a
financier he hus few equals, and his
loss will lie felt nowhere more keenly
thun in his native stute of New Mex
ico, which was the beneliciary of
some of his ublcst effort.
Mr. Martinez was lioin in Tans on
the 2Hth day of Murch, lr7, and was
therefore only a week short of 59
years of nge, at the time of his death
lie was the son of Felix T and Reyes
Cordova Martines, and was a descend
ant of (ieneral Felix Martinez, who
was governor of New Mexico in 1715,
He was educated by private teachers
and in the private schools of Mora
and Denver, und wu.s recognized by
all who knew him as a profound
scholar and student of public affairs.
On September . I8H0, Mr. Mar
tinet was married to Miss Virginia
Buster in l.us Vegas, and for some
time afterwards was engaged in mer
cantile business in l.as Vegas. In 1HHH
he sold out his mercantile business
and went into the real estate bus
iness in Las Vegas. In 1897 he moved
to El Paso where he immediately
took an active part in the business
life of that city, but at all times he
retained his legal residonce in Las
Vegas and was always a dominant
factor In the politics of that section
of New Mexico. He was one of the
organiiers of the El Paso chamber
of commerce and wat prominently
identified with numerous public en
terprise! In that city, including the
waterworks, the ttreet railway tyt
tern and the erection of the new ter
minal station.
Mr. Martinet was one of tha or
ganisers of the El Paso Valley Water
Users' association, which had most to
do with obtaining tha federal appro-
Jiriation for the Elephant Butte pro
ect, the largest Irrigation project in
the United States, which it now near
ing completion. He kat a prominent
figure in tha meeting between Pres
identa Taft and Dlat on tho Interna
tional bridge, between the United
States and Mexico, presenting golden
goblets to both presidents In a speech.
It was perhaps at a financier that
Mr. Martinet waa beat known. For

of the board of directors of the re

the enactment of the present federal
reserve bank act, which office he held
at the time of his death.
Mr. Martinet was a lifelong demo
crat and was always active in the
councils of that party In New Mexico,
lie was appointed by President Wil
son as one of the commissioners to
visit South American countries in the
interest of the Panama-PaciHc expo

ARMY EXTREMELY ANXIOUS TO
USE MEXICAN RAILROAD LINE.
Kan Antonio, Texas, March 20. The
steady and rapid advance of a part of
General Pershing's force into Mexico
has increased the desire of those in
army headquarters hern to urgo the
use of the Mexico Northwestern rail
way for handling supplies. Cruces, a
point that probably will be reached by
one of the cavalry detachments, is a
bout 200 miles from the border, and
take Bahicoru. a like distance. ,lt
was pointed out that any delay in get
ting supplies through from the border
to Catas Grandes, from where it ran
be sent forward to the mobile units
operating south of there, might in
terfere seriously with General Persh
ing's plan of pursuit.
(Ieneral Kunston evinced no impa
tience, but he did show concern and
expressed the hope that Carranr.n
would not misunderstand the motive
for his request. Even if the request
is granted, it will be some days before
the road ran be used, because at two
points, at least, repairs will have to
he made. American rolling stock will
have to be sent across the line on ac
count of Its lack on the other side,
and American crews and dispatchers
will be used.
"The reasons for their use should
be obvious," said an army officer to
night, "(ieneral Kunston has made it
plain to the war department that his
only desire to use the road is for the
transportation of supplies, but he bus
not concealed the fact that a guard
will be placed on every train and that
it might become necessary to station
guards at the different points along
the rest of the way."
General Pershing hus advised (ien.
Kunston that he hus found quantities
of alfalfa for bis animal, alio that
he hus experienced no difficulty in
getting grain.
The question of occupying cities and
towns in Mexico is not worrying those
ut headquarters. "Our troops will lie
loo busy to rump in any piuco long
nor would wo consider II wise, on ac
count of the sanitary conditions, to do
so," suid one of the headquarters nf
ficiulus. Whether the troops march
ed through (aleÃ±a or inanhed around
it on their way south is not known.
Genernl Pershing did not report on
that point.
