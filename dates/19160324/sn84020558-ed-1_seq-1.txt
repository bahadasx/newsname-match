WASHINGTON, March 23. The
Hay army increase bill, providing for
a regular army peace strength of
140,000 fighting men instead of the
present 100,000, passed the house late
today by a vote of 402 to 2. It goes
to the senate for immediate consid
eration virtually as drafted by the
house committee.
The negative votes were cast by
Representative Britten, republican of
Illinois and London, socialist of New
York.
All provisions for fixation of nitro
gen was stricken out, 224 to ISO, con
firming the action previously taken
in committee of the whole.
Mr. Kritten opposed the bill be
cause he favored a still further In
crease in the army and Mr. London
because he favored no increase.
The bill is the first of the great
national preparedness measures urged
by Iresident Wilson to pass either
house, although various related meas
ures have been approved. It was
adopted only after Representative
Kahn, ranking republican member of
the military committee, again had met
defeat, this time 213 to 191, in his ef
fort to increase the authorized
strength of the regulars to 220,000.
During the debate, Chairman Hay of
the committee which drew the bill re
ferred to it as "the president's own
bill." It was explained at the White
House, however, that while the presi
dent approved the ground plan of the
measure, he was not committed to its
details. The conference on the sen
ate and house plans, to come after the
senate acts, is expected by adminis
tration officials to produce a bill
which will have the president's full
support.
The measure went to the senate to
night and the way has been cleared
fur consideration of it to begin there
next Monday. Besides providing for
149JI00 enlisted men as the peace
strength of the standing army, ex
clusive of officers, hospital and quar
termaster corps and unassigned re
cruits, the bill as passed by the house
provides for the building up of a
force of 425,000 federalized national
guardsmen within five years. It pro
vides for an officers' reserve corps
of 50,000 for a complete industrial re
serve and for new recruiting systems
for both the regular army and tlie

AUGUSTA, (3a., March 23. With
six business blocks and more than
K00 dwelling houses, including many
of Augusta's finest residences, de
vastated by fire, relief committees to
day undertook the task of housing
and feeding without outside aid the
3,000 persons made homeless by the
conflagration. Tonight a relief fund
of $1T,000 had been raised and the
committee heads announced their de
termination to increase it to $50,000.
Word went out that no help from
other cities was needed.

a wireless call fur assistance to-
night and the coast guard cutter
Onondaga went to her aid. The
Alamo was reported 130 miles
northeast of Cape Hatteras with
a broken' rudder and her engines
disabled. The Alamo reported by
wireless yesterday that she was

Si TO DEFINE

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINHTON, March 23. The
United States soon will make for the
information of the nations of the world
a complete statement of its position in
regard to the conduct of submarine
warfare and the arming of merchant
ships for defensive purposes. It has
not been determined just what form
tjje announcement will take, but it is
regarded as not unlikely that a cir
cular memorandum may be addressed
to the powers.
Whatever the form of the declara
tion, prepared after careful considera
tion of all the claims made by both
sets of European belligerents, it will
serve to guide the course of this gov
ernment in future negotiations. The
United States will stand unalterably
upon the principles already laid down.
Homing from the mostpowerful of
the neutral nations, at a time when all
the other great world powers are at
war, the pronouncement may furnish
the ground work for a new interna
tional law to be developed after the
war, which will provide for the use of
submarines in naval warfare. The law
does not now take into consideration 1
the activities of submarines or the pos-
sibilities of their use. -
It la considered improbable that the
announcement will be made before the i
political situation in Germany, result- 1
ing from the retirement of Admiral von
Tirpitz, has been clarified. It is not be- i
lieved that the administration would be
willing to issue a statement defining its
position at a time when such an action
might be used in a political way by
factions in a nation with which it is
negotiating.
That a definition of defensive arma
ment will occupy a prominent position
in the declaration, whatever its form, is
virtually certain.
Limitations of defensive armament
may be described, and these will gov-

flLLEGED BOMB PLOTTERS MUST
Germans Northwest of Ver
dun Are Violently Shell
ing Malaneourt Sector
While French Bombard
ment Is Still Intense
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Except on the front near Gomme
court and the liethune-Labasee road,
where the British gained some advan
tage in fights against the Hermans, no
infantry engagements have taken place
today along the line in France and Bel
gium. Heavy fighting, however, con
tinues between the Hermans and Rus
sians on the eastern front from the
region of Riga southward.
The Hermans northwest of Verdun
are continuing their violent shelling of
the Malaneourt sector and again have
i trained their guns on the French front
of Bethincourt, Le Mort Homme and
Cumieres, probably preparatory to
fresh infantry attacks in an endeavor to
break through the line.
The French have not slackened their
bombardment of the jfalancourt wood
from positions in the Argonne forest
and also are heavily shelling Herman
positions and the roads and railways
held by the Germans in the eastern
part of the Argonne.
The bombardment to the northeast
of Verdun, as well as in the Woevre
has increased in intensity.
Heavy masses of Russians are press
ing the Hermans from Riga district
southward for a distance of seventy
miles. While they have gained some
advantages, the Russian war office ad
mits that south of Lake Dreswiaty the
Hermans recaptured trenches that the
Russians had taken the previous night.
The Russians have again pierced the
opposing line in the Jacobstadt sector.
According to the Herman official
communication "not even the smallest
advantage against the unshaken Ger
man defense," had been obtained any
where in this great offensive, which
the Russians have undertaken in north
west Russia. While Berlin declares
that the Russians have ceased their
vicious attacks in the neighborhood of
I'ostavy, eastward of the railway be
tween Dvinsk and Vilna, Russia of
ficially announces that the fighting
there continues and that southwest of
Lake Norocz the Russian troops again
have advanced under a violent bom
bardment. The Austrians, combatting the Rus
sians in Halicia, and the Italians along
the Austro-Italian frontier, appear to
be holding their lines without change.
A fourth Herman war loan has closed
and a Berlin dispatch says the money
raised will exceed the aggregate of the
second loan but will be less than the
third. This would mean that between
8,000,000,000 and 12,000,000.000 mark
have been obtained, the second loan
having realized S,97S,C0O,O0O marks and
the third loan 12,160,000,000 marks.
Russ Force German Lines
PETROGRAD, March 23 (via Lon
don). The Russian drive in the vicin
ity of Lake Narocz, according to re
ports received here, lias carried them
through three lines of German trenches.
While admitting that it is not yet
clear whether the fighting which is in
progress south of Dvinsk signifies a
general advance of the Russian troops
in that sector or whether it is intended !
as u uemonsirauon to attract Herman
forces from the Franco-German front,
the military critics lay emphasis upon
what they allude to as the universal
success of the attacks during the last
few days the vicionsness of which is
pointed to as being sufficient to have
made an Impression upon the German
general staff.
The Russian troops are operating in
three groups covering a front of sev
enty miles, but the severest fighting is
reported to have occurred in the vicin
ity of Lake Narocz, where the Russians'
drive carried them through three lines
of German trenches heavily protected
by wire entanglements. The Russians
resorted to their favorite method at
bayonet fighting, routing the Germans'
desperate resistance and capturing
more than 1,000 men, including 15 of-

STAND TRIAL ON INDICTMENTS
The court also refused the request
of the defendants that they be per
mitted to interrogate the federal
grand juries who brought the indl-.-t-ment
as to the sufficiency of the evi
dence on which they acted.
I It was also .decided by the court
that von Brincken, Mrs. Cornell and
Crowley must stand trial on the in
dictment charging them with m sue
of the United States mails.
The original indictment in the bomb
plots was thrown out by Judge Dool
ing on account of flaws and inade
quacies. The grand jury returned a
new indictment, the one sustained by
the court today. The new indictment
was drawn by Mrs. Annette A. .Adams,
assistant United States district at
torney who made the argument in
court against the motion to quash.

EL PASO, Texas, March 23. General Luis Herrera has revolted from
General Carranza and
power the entry of American troops into Mexico,
Villa, according to reports from sources believed
The news of Herrera's
tic for General Bell to telegraph General Funston
believed it to be true.
General Bell added to
Herrera's reported revolt
Garcia, which was supported by telegrams said
from General Herrera himself and General Gutierrez.
General Herrera has been known as a personal enemy of Villa. His
present position is said to be that the de facto government has betrayed
Mexican interests in permitting the soldiers of the United States to enter
Mexican territory and that this betrayal outweighs whatever offenses
Villa has committed.
Consul Garcia made public tonight a telegram which he said he had re
ceived from General Gavira announcing that the Carranzistas had de
feated Villa today at Santa Gertrudes, near Namiquipa. According to
the announcement, Villa, after leaving several dead and wounded in the
field, abandoned 100 horses and fled to El Oso.
GEN. FUNSTON PUZZLED
SAN ANTONIO, March 23. With a
message from General Bell before him
confirming his report of yesterday that
General Luis Herrera had revolted
with two thousand men in Chihuahua
and a collection of evidence at hand
from unofficial sources denying the al
leged revolt, General Funston was as
puzzled tonight as to the exact status
of affairs in Mexico as he was this
morning.
General Bell was the first to inform
General Funston that Herrera was re
ported to have joined Villa in his fight
against the United States. General
Funston instructed General Bell to in
vestigate the report and inform him of
developments. The message late to.
day that he had "confirmed" his report
of yesterday was General Bell's reply.
He did not report additional facts con
cerning the new movement and did not
tell how the report was confirmed.
To offset General Bell's statement,
messages from El Paso quoted General
Gavira and Consul Andres Garcia in
denial; the consul at Laredo submitted
a denial, and Samuel Belden, consul
here far Carranza, made public a mes
sage he said he received from General 1
Herrera in Chihuahua, dated today. In
(this message General Herrera denied
that he had revolted, adding that on
the contrary he was "ready to fight
Villa as energetically as possible."
General Funston transmitted to the
war department the message from Gen
eral Bell and awaited anxiously the re
sult of the investigation the state de
partment had benun through its con
sular representatives in Chihuahua,
Torreon and Durango.
The day passed without a report
from General Pershing, making this the
fourth day General Funston has been
ignorant of developments south of
Casas Grandes. He sent General Per-
shing instructions today to send more
complete information regarding devel
opments and another message warn
ing him of the reported activities of
General Herrera. Receipt of his com
munications was acknowledged at
Casas Grandes, but today no report had
been received.

Chihuahua who arrived here tonight,
said that Villa had held up a train on

S5 miles northeast from Namiquipa,
where the Carranza authorities have

Flores is well known in business cir
cles in El Paso.
"We were traveling north from Chi-
