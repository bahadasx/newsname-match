should i.ut venture forth without his
blunderbuss. One day he had an
important errand, hut the blunder
buss, when he came to get it, wai
missing from the rack made of an
tlers where it alwa hung. Some
one of his family had taken it. Abe
sat down to wait till it was brought
back. 1
"But, Abe, I thought you wer a
fatalist ?" Faid a friend.
"So I am," the old man n-
wered.
"Then why bother about yotur
blunderbuss?" taunted the friend.
"You are fn no danger from the In
dians, since you can't possibly die
till your time comes'
"Yes," said the old man, "but
ruppose I was to meet an Indian

do for me not to have my blnnder-

A Sure Investment.
You have never yet made an investment
Where you didn't expect to win,
But you sometime have found to your sorrow
You'ye beautifully taken in.
You may have laid down your good money
For a brick which you found wasn't gold,
Or met the Bohemian oats swindler,
When you, with your oats, have.been sold.
If asked by a friend to play poker,
You'd experience, no doubt quite a shock;
Then never join hands with a fellow
Who makes money by watering stock.
Now if you would like an investment
In which you can't possibly lose,
Supose a few dollars in one of Ed, M. Egg Pine
Tailored Suits. Cor. 5th and Jackson Street
