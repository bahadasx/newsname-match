Herrera Disloyalty Denied.
j Maj. Gen. Funston sent this telegram I
J to the War Department:
! Jen. Herrera in a telegram to deti.
Gavira strongly denies all reports that !
lie has gone over to Villa. Gen. Gutierrez,
governor of Chihuahua, in a letter
to Gen. Gavira, also strongly denies r
that Gen. Herrera has gone oxer to j
Villa."
Consul Letcher dispatched a report '
that Gen. Herrera was in command
i of the do facto troops there and was ::
"loyal to Gen. Carranza."
| His report is regarded as removing"
one of the most menacing features of j
j the Mexican situation.
i Letcher Report Has Weight. j
Although Gen. Funston and Gen. Bell '
on the border have received reports ;
confirming the. story of the revolt,
; which they believe to be true, the disJ
patch from Consul Letcher, who is on !|
i the ground and has headquarters at the !(
place where the revolt was .said to
j have occurred, is taken by officials here h
I as confirming the statements of Car-.'
I ranza officials that no such revolt has
j occurred.
The problem of meeting any request '
j Gen. Funston might make for rein-I*
forcements 111 event of a rebellion of i
Carranza's army was under considera- I
tion, how ever. If the American forces']
were seriously attacked, it was regarded
as likely that all available troops:
from the border would be rushed to the i '
support of the advancing columns, and i*
that these troops w ould be replaced as ;;
quickly as possible, in' order not to
leave the border towns unguarded.
Only the National Guard, it is said. !
couid be relied on to do the latter 4
work. | ,

the nations of the world, a clear state- t

Whatever the form of the declaration

The law does not take into considerstion
