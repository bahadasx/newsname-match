called, is 92 years old and his
gcod wife is in her 82nd year.

tho planning of this trip by the Knox
vlllo Hoard of Commerce to mako It
a puccPSM, and allow tho members of
the parly tho longest possible stay
in each town, ami yet mako tho num
ber of towns necessary to cover so
much territory on tho first trip.
Few realize tho amount of work
and preparation that Is Involved In
the running of one of theso Trado
Trips. Heforo tlip train starts on its
way, the executive committee in
charge of tho Trade Trip will havo
spent many weeks In working out the
details, in orner to Insure no hitch or
confusion.
First, the route had to bo selected;
the itinerary adopted and tho ar
rangements made for the railway
equipment and for tho facilities af
forded the members of the trip. Tho
commissary car must bo stocked, the
supplies being, so fur as possible, the
products of the sections to bo visited
and bought in Knoxvlllo, which In It
self should provo a big advertisement
for tho trip; tho red, white and blue

worn secured. These badges will
have printed on them: "Knoxvillo's
First Trade Trip, April 11th to Htli,"
nnd nn the identification portion will
bo printed the name and title of tho
member and the firm represented,
This will bo a great nid to tho peoplo
of the towns visited, as it will not bo
necessary for one to ask names, but
by merely looking at any member's
badge one can get the member's name,
title and all. Besides these badges,
each member of the Trade Trip will
wear a white hat with tho word
"Knoxvlllo" printed on the band,
which will also he an aid in distin
guishing the local boosters from the
Trado Trip members, allowing them
to get together in tho shortest possi
ble time. There Is also the assign-
r ' DUi0- F-&r-!0,l!'J.llman accom

great many other things which must
be taken care of by tho Trado Trip
committee of tho Knoxvlllo Board of

will give maximum results to the
Knoxvlllo business men as well as to
the business men of tho towns to be

when It began. It has but olncured

nn enormous demand for c things
which the United States Is iiMo to pro

stopped nnd their laborers nre no
longer employed we must deal with a
situation for which wise forcthtutKht

peaceful Industries of all Hurope and
has stopped that competitive foreign
production which tu .Inly. 1011. had al
ready entered American markets to
supersede Amcrlenu products under
the tariff law of 1013. The war has
thus given to American products nn
Immunity from competition far moro
effective than any possible protootlvo
tariff. Hut that Is temporary, nnd
when the war Is over, when foreign
