HIRE FIELD CORN
ACCEPT "FARMER" SM 1 T H'S
FREE SEED OFFER BlO
MEETING SATURDAY.
Some 40 acres of field corn will
be planted, cultivated and matured
in Thurston county this year, as one
direct result of the visit to this city
last Friday and Saturday of C. L.
("Farmer") Smith, agriculturist of
the Union Pacific system, and his
son, Lou S. Smith, who Inaugurated
in this city a tour of Southwest
Washington which will end in Tenino
April 8. This is a larger number
than responded to the offer of the
Northern Pacific experts during their
recent visit and indicates a growing
interest among farmers in the pro
duction here of this crop.
Those 40 acres will be planted Ay
the 30 farmers who accepted the
railroad's offer to furnish enough
free seed of one variety to plant one
acre of ground. Some farmers took
a sack of one variety, either Yellow
Dent or White Flint, a few took a
sack of each, and as the result of the
enthusiasm and interest of the farm
ers, Smith distributed more than 200
pounds of seed corn—all he had with
him and far more than he expected
to distribute, far more than usually
distributed in one locality—during
his stay in this city, to be cultivated
according to hia instructions and to
be matured, not merely developed to
the ensilage stage.
Seed for Schools, Too.
As the result of the free distribu
tion of seed corn here by the two
railroad systems, from 75 to 100
acres of corn that will mature in this
climate will be grown in the county
this year. Supplementing this, the
Union Pacific' system, at the request
of County Superintendent O. C. GOBS,
will supply him with enough seed to
plant 10 acres more, according to an
announcement made this week by T.
I. McOrath, the local agent. This
seed will be distributed to the va
rious schools of the county for the
use of those pupils who enter the an
nual agricultural and industrial con
test
The big dairy meeting at the Cham
ber of Commerce last Saturday, when
talks were made by Parmer Smith,
O. E. Gibson and J. J. Lashbrook of
the federal department of agricul
ture, L. R. Campbell, president of the
Thurston County Dairymen's associa
tion, and others, was attended by
more than 100 farmers and was re
ported by many of them afterwards
to have been the most enthusiastic
gathering of farmers for many
months. .
Friday afternoon "Parmer" Smith
talked to the high school students,
emphasizing particularly the value of
pig clubs, and that evening he gave
a "straight-from-the-shoulder" talk
to 60 or 60 local business men, in
which he suggested that they arrange
a big picnic for the farmers this sum
mer and then, as he put It, "go out
th re and mix around and show the
farmer you really do want to get
close to him."
"Feed Pigs, Not Hogs."
He declared the city vitally inter
ested in the development of the coun
try; said farmers should adopt a sys
tem of cost accounting in farm pro
duction as good business policy; as
serted that most farmers had more
livestock on their farms than they
could feed and care for properly,
adding that most of them never
thought about feed until they were
out of it; and In talking about hog
ralsing said, "Every week that the
age of a hog is increased, the amount
of food necessary to produce a pound
of weight is increased, and after they
pass the 200-pound mark no man
ever made a profit feeding. They
should be sold before they weigh 200
pounds. Feed pigs, not hogs."
During his talk at the dairy meet
ing Saturday he said that two-thirds
of the cows in the county were not
paying their board, and when some
one questioned the statement he of
fered to bet he was right. He urged
the production of corn as the best
livestock food, declared that no farm
er should have more livestock than
he could raise feed for, and urged
every farmer to arrange now to grow
enough feed on his own farm to
carry his stock through the winter.
Buying feed for that purpose he char-

Commissioners Delay Action on John
ston Bridge Hids One Week.
Contract for the completion of the
Dave Johnston road and bridge will
probably be awarded by the county
commissioners next Monday, the bids
opened last Monday afternoon having
been taken under advisement until
that time. Four bids were received:
W. A. Weller, $3,987.45; Wright &

A. Van Eaton, who was county com
missioner when the first work on the
brid b e was done, $4,000, and Blge

Protests to the completion of the
bridge, which were heard last Mon
day morning, were presented by three
persons, who also offered a petition.
The arguments offered were that the
road and bridge were not needed,
that they would be expensive to main
tain because of the several hundred
feet of trestle, and that the money
should be spent on other roads in the
neighborhood.
WEST REPORTED EXPELLED
Pomona Grange Said to Have Taken
Drastic Action on Van Houten
Charges. '
Reports current locally after the
March meeting of the Thurston Coun
ty Pomona Orange at South Bay last
Tuesday say that A. O. West, former
master of the Brighton Park Orange
and supervisor of Road District No.
6, was expelled from membership in
the Pomona and in any subordinate
grange, as the result of charges pre
ferred by former County Agent O. C.
Van Houten.
Pomona Master L. L. Snow refused
to make any statement regarding the
Orange's action, nor would any offi
cial confirm the reports. The action
was taken in a closed session and the
decision was clothed with as much
secrecy as possible, but in spite of
this the report that West was expelled
gained currency. West, it is Bald,
did not attend the Pomona meeting.
If the report of his expulsion is true,
the action follows the recommenda
tion which was said to have been
made at the February meeting by the
special committee which conducted
the trial on the charges brought by
Van Houten.
In spite of the inclement weather
some 75 persons representing most
of the subordinate granges of the
county attended the meeting, while
the South Bay school children and
teachers attend the open session. A
discussion of "Preparedness" and
several interesting talks enlivened
the lecturer's program, and J. J.
Lashbrook, the federal agent who Is
assisting in the organization of a
cow-tflßtlng association here, made a
short talk. An excellent dinner was
served by the South Bay ladles.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1916
Grossip of the Political
Cla-ns
There doesn't seem to be much
doing jet in county politics, except
that plans are being laid for the
meetings of the Democratic and Re
publican central committees, and the
sessions of the latter have already
been set for Saturday, March 25, in a
call issued last week by Chairman E.
H. Sanford of Bucoda. Chairman
Fuller of the Democratic committee
issued a call this week for its meet
ing, and set the date as Saturday,
April 8. After these sessions the
dates for the county conventions, to
select delegates to the state con
v ntions, will be announced, and
the times also set for the precinct
caucuses and the basis of representa
tion in the county meetings.
There hasn't been any indication
of anything doing along Progressive
party lines—and many a political
sermon could be written on those
dozen words, perhaps a few political
requiems sung.
The probabilities are it will be
some months, June or July perhaps,
before county politics does begin to
kick- about a bit. This much appears
to be fairly well settled now, however
the Non-Partisan ticket of two
years ago Is apt to remain In the
archives of ancient political history,
there to repose as a somewhat shining
and spectacular example of a good
thing gone wrong. The chances now
are, to state it otherwise, that if
there are two tickets in the local
Held this fall, and of course there will
be, they will be out and out Repub
lican and Democratic tickets.
All of which brings to mind the
story that has floated around the
courthouse and in and out of other
political circles for some months with
Increasing persistency, that T. Ives
Dodge, who was one of the two com
missioners elected on the Non-Parti
san ticket in 1914, will be a candi
date tor the Republican nomination
to the legislature. This rumor also
carries the Information that he pro
poses to resign the commissionership
to make the race, but apparently not
a great deal of faith is placed in that
feature of It. Dodge, of course, hasn't
had anything to say about it and even
if he intended to fulfil the rumor he
probably would wait some months yet
before he did say much about it.
[ And at that, Dodge will find him
self In a beautiful position if he does
WEALTHY RESIDENT
SUES FOR DIVORCE
MRS. BUBHNEI.IL STARTS PRO
CEEDINGS AGAINST HUSBAND
' SAW TO BE INSANE.
Considerable interest was aroused
locally when Mrs. G. M. Bushneil,
one of the wealthiest residents of the
county and owner of the 315-acre
farm near Talcott lake upon which
she located six years ago, filed suit
in the local superior court last Satur
day for a divorce from her husband,
who has never lived here. Besides
her local property, Including the farm,
80 head of stock and two automobiles,
Mrs. Bushneil owns half of the capital
| stock of the Tacoma Ice company and
a similar amount of the stock of the
Seattle Ice company, and has other
outside investments.
Mrs. Bushneil also secured a tem
porary injunction restraining her
husband, Willliam B. Bushneil, who
resides in the East, from bringing an
action to divide the community prop
erty. The hearing on the injunction
will be had next Tuesday.
Mrs. Bushneil alleges in her com
plaint that her husband has been con
*he insane aaylnm at Kanka
kee, 111., and that agents representing
him are threatening to sue her. She
says she has offered to furnish her
husband with a home, but that he
refuses this. She has engaged Thomas
M. Vance and C. D. King of this city
and the law firm of Kerr & McCord
of Seattle to prosecute her case.
Mrs. Bushnell's farm is not only one
of the largest in the county, but also
has a reputation as being one of the
show places of Southwest Washing
ton, being modernly equipped

attempt to break in after that job.
Hie alienated himself from the old
tltne Republicans when he side
tracked into the Bull Moose aggrega
tion in 1912, that time to run for the
legislature, and he rubbed it in still
more when he sailed Into the com
missionershlp uuder the Non-Partisan
banner in 1914. And since he has
been on that Job he has managed to
rid himself of most of the support he
had two years ago, the support that
put him where he is now. There are
those who would like to see Dodge
get into that campaign, providing the
second stanza of the aforesaid rumor
is true —they would welcome him,
and also wallop him.
Except that it is taken for granted
those incumbents who can will seek
re-election, including in this category
County Auditor Annie Gaston, County
Clerk I. N. Holmes, Commissioner
Frank Littlejohn, Prosecuting Attor
ney Geo. F. Yantis and County Su
perintendent O. C. Goss, there is
almost no talk at all as to likely
county candidates. Fred W. Stock
ing, who was appointed county treas
urer by the commissioners to succeed
the late W. H. Britt, is planning to
run for that office on the Republican
ticket, so the story goes; J. C. Sams K
who is finishing up his second term
as assessor, is likely to be in the run
ning for some other office, and Deputy
Sheriff Jack Glfford will probably
enter the race to succeed McCorkle.
There will have to be some new can
didates, for In addition to the places
mentioned there are some pretty goad
jobs to be filled this year by new per
sons—engineer, assessor, and com
missioner to succeed A. M. Rowe,
providing all of the present officials

The present apathy is of course
not remarkable. The state and na
tional situation—meaning by the lat
ter one Theodore Roosevelt, inosfar as
the Republicans figure* in the nation
al situation —must work itself around
to a more definite alfgnment before
the smaller affairs of county politics
will attract much attention. There's
lots of time yet, and the chances are
that in this highly political fourth
year there will be all kinds and de

time comes. It will be

REPUBLICAN LUNCHEON
Men and Women of G. O. P. Faith to
Gather Here Saturday
Some 25 or 30 women and at least
100 men are expected to attend the
Republican luncheon to be given in
the Elks' hall at 1 o'clock Saturday
afternoon, preceding the meeting of
the Republican county central com
mittee, which Chairman E. H. San
ford has called to meet at 2 o'clock.
Local Republicans have issued a gen
eral invitation to those of that faith
throughout the county, and the Invi
tations sent to the precinct commit
teemen asked them to bring at least
two guests from their districts, with
the privilege of bringing as many
more as they desire.
No speaking program has been
planned, according to J. C. Sams,,
chairman of the committee on ar
rangements, but there probably will
be one address at the luncheon, which
is for women as well aa men. Chair
men Sanford will preside at the com
mittee session, when a date for the
county convention will be decided, as
well as the manner of selecting dele
gates to that meeting and the date
upon which they are to be chosen.
MAY APPOINT VAN EPPS.
Local Democrat Reported Likely to
Be Chosen as State Forester.
E. L. Van Epps, one of the well
known Democrats of the city, former
city engineer of Olympia and last
summer and fall a special engineer
for the public service commission en
gaged in the work of eliminating
grade crossings, is reported to be the
most likely candidate for the appoint
ment as state forester to fill the va
cancy created by the resignation of
E. W. Ferris to become postmaster at
Mt. Vernon.
The appointment will not be made
until the regular meeting of the for
estry board the latter part of this
month and a number of persons have
filed their applications, but Mr. Van
Epps not only has strong political
support favoring his appointment
but his qualifications for the place
are so well recognised that he is ex
pected to land it.
Attorney C. E. Collier filed a peti
tion in bankruptcy in the federal
court at Tacoma the latler part of
last week and Monday obtained an
order in the local court restraining
Scott & Marshall collecting on a judg

obtained on a grocery bill, until the
bankruptcy proceedings are ended.

FEDERAL ORGANIZER SPENDING
WEEK IN COUNTY TO FORM
ASSOCIATION.
Some 16 members, owning about
275 cows, had been obtained towards
the organization of a cow-testing
association in Thurston county up to
Wednesday night, according to J. J.
Lashbrook of the federal department
of agriculture, who Is spending the
week in this territory in an effort to
form such an organization.
Mr. Lashbrook was assisted Tues
day by O. E. Gibson, another federal
organizer, and if the organization la
not completed when the former la
i compelled to return to Eastern Wash
| ington Friday night, Mr. Gibson flans
to take up the work again here nest
Monday. The business interests of
the city have been co-operating
heartily in the efforts to perfect the
organization.
Wednesday the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce voted to pur
chase and donate to the association
the use of a cow-testing outfit;
Adolph Schmidt of the Olympia Dairy
Products company has been donating
his time and an automobile this week
to escorting Mr. Lashbrook to the
various districts of the county, and!
Frank M. Kenney, cashier of the
Olympia National bank, donated the
use of his machine to Mr. Gibson
Tuesday. Various farmers of the
county, including L. R. Campbell,
president of the Dairymen's Assod*-
ion, C. C. Asplnwall and others, hawp
also assisted in promoting the organ
isation.
If the association to successfully
launched, It must, under the gorem
ment requirements, have members
who own a total of at least SOO cows,
upon which they are to pay $1.50 a
year per cow. Their herds are tested ,
for milk production and butter-fat
content once each month by a man
who to employed to travel from farm
to farm to make the Babcock teat,
accurate production records are kept,
including cost of feed and labor cost,
and suggestions* as to feeding are
made by the tester. In this way, the
association strives to cheapen the
cost while increasing the production
of a herd, and singles out the cow*
which do not produce enough to pagr
for their feed, so they can be elimi
nated from the herd.
