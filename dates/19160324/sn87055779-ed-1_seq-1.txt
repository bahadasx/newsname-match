TO DISCUSS EIGHT
South Bend and Mishawaka
People Called to Mass
Meeting Tuesday.
Mayor Fred W. Keller and Mayor j
P.alph Gaylor havt called a mass
meeting of citizens of South Bend!
and Mishawaka to be held Tuesday I
night in the council chambers1 of the)
South Bend city hall to discuss the)
fight being waged for lower gas
rates In the two cities. The an-.
nouncement of
the maps meeting
Friday morning by
I was made here
j Mayor Keller after a conference
1 with Mayor Taylor and the South
j Pend executive urged that as many
citizens as possible attend the ses-
sion.
At the present time there is a pe
tition before the Indiana public util
ities commission asking- that a val
uation of the property and assets of
the Northern Indiana Gas & F.lee
tric ., be made and the gas rate
s-ei. This petition was tiled with the
coiiinus-sion two years ago but is
still on llle, other matter having oc
cupied the body's attention in the
meantime. Mayor Keller pointed
out Friday morning that the com
l i.'-sion has been very busy, being
Foodtd with similar petitions but
believes that some action can be se
cured in the near future. He com
imnird graciously upon the manner
and tinio spent upon the electric
light jufstion by the commission.
"We want to get the .sentiment of
the people of South Bend and Mish
nv. alia regarding the right for lower
rate." Mayor Keller explained. He
i nfc i red that, unless the administra
tions were ion some " token ty
v j. h they could be a.sured of sup
port that the effort for lower rates
would he allowed to remain dor
mant. The gas rate in South Bend is $1
! net," he stated. "In Kvansville and
j Fort Wayne It is btit S5 cents. In
i Terre Haute it is 90 cents and in In
'dianapolis 53 cent."."
j There ha.s been considerable agi
I tation for a lone: time regarding a
j chance in the. gas rate and the ac
I tlon taken by the commission in the
electric race hae permitted the

Gen. Pershing ad Gen. Bertani
of Tirst Chief's Forces
Confer on Plan of
Campaign.
International New SeTrice:
EL, PASO, Texas, Marci 24. A
worn a-nd dusty courier brought into
Juarez early today a report that
American troops had engaged Fran
cisco Villa's main force five miles
east of Namiquipa, The gcene of
the battle, he said, was El Oso ranch
which is Bkirted by a narrow road
that runs southward from La
Cruces to Choyas. The courier con
firmed the announcement made by
Gen. Gaviera at midnight that Villa
had b-?en surrounded by American
and Carranza troops and that a gen
eral attack would he made on the
bandit leader's position at dawn.
Villa, the courier said, had select
ed a fine position in which to give
battle, being on a small plateau be
tween the Rio de Santa Maria and
the Ria Del Carmen. It was to tht
position that Villa fell back after
he had met defeat in a skirmish with
Carranzista troops at Santa Ger
trudis ranch, southeast of Namiquipa.
The courier also confirmed reports
that Gen. Pershing and Gen. Ber
tani, commander of the Carranza
field frces, were cooperating fully
and that the arrangements for the
attack on Villa had been made at a
conference between the two leaders
at Namiquipa yesterday afternoon.
Conference Informal.
This conference, he eaid, was
wholly informal. The two dust-covered
commanders ehoök hands as
they met and discussed the pro
posed movements In the shade of an
adobe hut. When they parted, ac
cording to the courier, Pershing re
turned to his field headquarters.
The announcement that Villa had
been forced to stand at bay at El
Oso wis received by the military
authorities at Fort Bliss, Gen. Bell's
headquarters, as an Indication that
the bandit leader's plan to escape
had at least been thwarted for the
time being. The road that runs
south to Choyas forms a Junction
at that town with two other roads,
one running southeast, the other
southwest. If he were able to reach
Choyas. Villa could divide his force
there and confuse his pursuers as to
which trail he had taken, with the
probability that they would have to
divide their forces also. Villa's de
light ia to weaken his enemies in
this faahion and then make a sud
den attack.
Though Villa in oerson wa re
ported at El Oso rancn it was diffi
cult to believe that the "fox of the
Sierra Madre mountains" had al
lowed himself to be trapped so eariy
in the campaign. Other rumors had
Villa at other points. Jose Garcia
Flores reached El Paso with the
story that Villa himself had stopped
a train at Montezuma half way be
tween. Chihuahua and Juarez, and
had searched the train for Ameri
cans. Says lie Saw Villa.
"I know Villa well and I saw
him," faid Flores. "He told every
one that IaiIs Herrera had joined
him to fight the common enemy and
that G?n. Gano also would fight
under his command.
Efforts will be made today by
Andrea Garcia, Mexican consul, to
effect the release from the El Paso
Jail of Malcher Herrera, brother of
the general reported leading the
mutiny against Carranza in Chihua
hua. Despite series of denials from offi
cial Mexican sources, reports persist
ed that Gen. Herrera had quit Chi
huahua with 2,000 troops to take
the field "against the common en
emy" and in Mexico "the common
enemy" is the United States.

"I wish to expres my sympathy

Increasing our navy as quickly as

are dependent upon an adequate

Is practically unanimous that thij
should be done regardless of tho ex
