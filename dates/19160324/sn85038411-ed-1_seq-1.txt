By Associated Press
Washington. March 21. The
question of calling' the National
(•uartl for border duty to release
regulars for service in Mexico was
discussed at to-day's cabinet meet
ing but it was decided there was
no prospect of such action at
tills time.
The cabinet was told thai there
was sentiment in Congress to pro
tect the constantly lengthening
line of communications of Hie
\mcricau punitive expedition b>
sending more regulars Into Mexico
and placing guardsmen along the
border.
Major General I'unston. how
ever. had not asked for additional
troops, it was stated to-day. and
War Department oflicials did not
believe mobilization of State •
troops was now necessary. After
l lie cabinet meeting olliclals
showed they lea red a mobilization
of guardsmen would have a dis
quieting affect in Mexico. They
expressed confidence that \mcr
icnti troops In Mexico were in no
danger. Should large bodies of
Carrauxa troops go over to Villa,
however, the question of calling
out the guard will Ite considered.
K1 Paso, Tex., March 24. —No word
hail come to military headquarters
here early to-day to confirm a report
that American troops and the Car
ranza army had surrounded Villa and
his men and that a battle was im
minent.
The report was received by Mex
ican Consul Andres Garcia.
The Villa outlaws were said to be
hemmed in at Kl Oso, about live miles
south of Namlquipa, where Villa had
tied after a conflict with Carranza
forces at Santa Gertrudes. Villa, ac
cording to a dispatch from General
Bertani. Carranza commander in the
lield of operations, made a stand In
the Santa ('lark canyon near Santa
Gertrudes, but was driven out with a
loss of several men killed and one
hundred horses captured.
Another liuttlc Impending
The los of the horses was a hard
blow to Villa, it was said, as he de
pends on the high quality of the mer
its of the men to execute rapid moves,
information regarding the impending
battle at El Oso was expectantly
awaited to-day by Consul Garcia and
General Gavira at Juarez. Brigadier
General Bell at Fort Bliss was with
out information regarding General
Pershing's forces whose strategic
moves in the Chihuahua district have
been cloaked in strict silence.
For several days General Pershing
has made no report regarding his
movements to his superiors.
Early to-day Andres Garcia, the
< 'arranza consul here, displayed tele
grams which, he said, he had received
from General Bertani, at Casas

In March quarter sessions tliis.

Stroup asked the members of the sec
ond precinct, Sixth ward eleetto.il,
board to furnish the county prosecu
tor's office and the Dauphin county j
courts with any information they I
might have whfch would assist the
further prosecution of the election
frauds at the September,' lUIS,

The district attorney made this un
usual request in open fcourt before
calling William M. Jones. J. H. Reed,
Delano Jones and George' E. Mdore,
the election board for sentence' on the
charge of conspiracy.
Not a simile member of the board
complied with the request.
William M. Jones, the Judge of the
board and the only member who faced
a jury and was convicted, asked for
, permission to file reasons for a new
trial and the court- allowed him ten
days for the purpose. .
Culled For Sentence Tills Afternoon
District Attorney Stroup insisted
upon sentence for ti\e other three men
and President Judge K link el. fixed 2
o'clock this afternoon for imposing
the penalties.
Three months in jail and $25 fine
were imposed upon all three—Delano
Jones, Moore and Reed.
Moore and Reed got an additional
line of $25 apiece and 3 months.for
I violating the election laws. The jail
terms run concurrently.
The second precinct. Sixth ward
board, was accused of conspiring to
, defeat Rertron A. Wellls. as a Re
publican candidate for constable over
Benjamin Smith by making a
fraudulent count and return in such
a way as to give Smith a majority of
one vote. A recount showed Weills
an easy victor.
Reed. Delano Jones, and Moore ad
mitted that a fraudulent count had
obviously been returned but denied
that they had had any part in its per
petration. They accordingly entered
pleas of "nolle contendere" —no de
fense.
