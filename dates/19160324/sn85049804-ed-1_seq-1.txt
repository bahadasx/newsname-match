JUDGE.
Thirty years of training in the

municipal court.
He was admitted to the bar in
1899," after graduating from the law
department of Drake university, and
has appeared as attorney in hun
dreds of cases during the past sev
enteen years ith success.
But his thirty years as court re
porter—occupying the same" disinter
ested relation to each case as the
judge—qualify him for the positioi
as no amount of office prattice as an
attorney could do.

THE HEAT FRANCHISE.
Monday the people of Dee Moines
will have an opportunity to vote on
the steam heating franchise in the
down town district.
This is a distinct public improve
ment and one for which no voter can
have any hesitancy in endorsing.
While it serves directly the business
district, it still affects every public
spirited citizen. Aside from being
a service the city needs it will be the
one factor in eliminating the smoke
nuisance which at present is a detri
ment to our city.
The burning of thousands of tons
of soft coal produces clouds of smoke
and soot which disfigures everything
it touches.
It means thousands of dollars paid
to Des Moines labor. It means more
coal burned from the Des Moines
fields and without smoke.
It will cost the taxpayers nothing.
It is a boost for Des Moines.
It has been endorsed and investi
gated by the Chamber of Commerce,
the Greater Des Moines Committee,
the Retail Merchants association, the
smoke abatement commission, Mayor
Hanna, the department of public
safety and the cit ycouncil.
A vote for the franchise is a vote
against smoke.
