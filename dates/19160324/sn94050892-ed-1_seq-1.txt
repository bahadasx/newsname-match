NEW ROUTE
Mutual Advantages' to . " Greenlee'
County and Mining Companies at
Mogollon Are Apparent Joint Com
mittee Goes Over- Route.
The initial steps in an undertaking
- having for its ultimate end the con
struction of a hiehwav connecting
Greenlee county witb the Mogollon
Mlniner TM strict were take a this
week when a committee from the
Greenlee County Chamber ot Com
merce, accompanied by S. C. Redd,
county engineer, met Mr. S. J. Kid
der and A. J. Anderson, mine mana
gers from the Mogollon district, who
were accompanied by Mr. Botsford,
mining engineer for the Mogollon
Mines companvy and went over that
portion of the'proposed highway lying
in New. Mexico.. The party, from
Clifton was composed of Messrs .
Kelly, Webster and Redd, who left
here on Monday morning horseback.
On the trail going over they were
Joined by Forest Supervisor Adams
and J. D. Parks, both familiar with
that section of the country. The
party from Clifton spent Monday at
the Stockton ranch, ten miles this
side of Jackson, New Mexico, where
they were entertained in a . hospita
ble manner by Mr. and Mrs. Stock
ton. The party from Mogollon arrived at
the Stockton ranch at noon on Tues
day and an idea of the country be
tween Stockton's ranch and Mogollon
can be gained when .the statement is
made that the party drove over in an
auto and was able to proceed west of
the ranch for a distance of three
miles in the same conveyance. At
this point the entire party, now con
' slating of twelve members, mounted
horses and rode in a westerly direc
tion for two or three miles over a
rolling country to the Arizona state
line,. The personel of the party . at
this time consisted of Wm. Stock
ton, Miss Gertrude Stockton.' Roy
Allison, Jack Bass, S. J. Kidder, A.
-J. -Anderson, R. R. Webster, Oscar
Layton, Engineer Botsford, Engineer
S. C. Redd and W. B. Kelly.
Before starting on the trip to the
Arizona line a discussion of the. road,
proposition was had between- the
representatives from Clifton and the
mine managers from Mogollon. The
mutual advantages to be gained by
the construction of the .. connecting
highway were gone into . thoroughly
The potent reasons advanced for the
contraction iof the highway may be
given as. folfc ws:
x . A "shter haul between Clifton
and Mogollon as compared to Silver
City ;
i. A better highway between Clif
ton and Mogollon as. compared to Sil
ver City, such a highway being open
for traffic every day in . the year,
properly graded and drained.
3. The connection afforded Mogol
lon with -a rich agricultural district
in Greenlee county , thus affording
cheaper hay and grain
That the mine managers from Mo
gollon were fully alive to the advan
tages offered by the proposed Clifton
Mogollon road was evidenced ' from
the start. They . frankly ,. stated to
the Clifton representatives that ? hey
looked at the proposition from ' ' a
purely business standpoint and a3
surod them that if the proposition was
such that the Mogollon district could
reduce their haulage expense by a
connecting road to Clifton that ' they
were willing to build the necessary
portion of the road in New Merico
without asking for any assistance.
Tha. the saving in haulage charges
from Clifton as compared to Silver
City can- be shown beyond a doubt is
the opinion of those who have made
a study of the conditions. That this
saving will amount to more than twen
. ty-five thousand dollars per annum
is making a low and conservative es
x tiniate. Men who are familiar with
freighting in this section . have no
hesitancy in saying that the freight
charges can be reduced twenty per
cent, and probably more, over the
route of the Clifton-Mogollon . high
way. .
The mine managers staled to the
committee from Clifton that their
haulage charges per annum amounted
to approximately $200,000 and that
fifty per cent of this amount was
expended in hauling crude oil alone.
On this commodity the present freight
rate on the railroad is the same to
Clifton as it is to Silver City. On
this item alone the saving in wason
cr truck haulage would be $20,000
per annum if not more.
Thit portion of the road lying in
New Mexico will be comparatively
easy to build as an old road is now
in use within two miles of the Arizona
line and withi a comparatively small
outlay could be put in good condition
for heavy teams and trucks. In.
Greenlee county it would be necessary
to build a - road approximately eigh
teen miles in length to make the
connection at the boundary line be
tween Arizona and New Mexico, as
a portion of the present highway be
tween Clifton and Duncan would be
traveled to a point eight miles east
of Clifton. It is roughly estimated
that the amount to be expended by
Greenlee county would amount to
$75,000. It is necessary to dwell on
. the importance to Clifton and the agri
cultural districts of the county by con
necing this section with a new mar
ket and mining district at Mogollon.

NO FEDERAL GUARD,
FOR ARIZONA TOWNS
TOMBSTONE, March 21. There
will be no federal aid to Che towns of
Cochise county except those immedi
ately exposed to raids 'from Mexico
according to the message that was
received by Sheriff Wheeler in reply
to the one that he sent to Gen. Puns
ton. -The telegram received this
morning read as follows:
"Replying to your telegram the de
partment commander directs me to
inform you that it is ' impossible to
furnish guards from federal troops to
all towns in New Mexico and Arizona
that have asked for them. No less
than twenty towns have requested
guards. You can therefore see that
federal troops would be scattered
across these two states and would not
be available for any concentrated ac
tion . The only points that have been
given guards are those that were in
imminent danger of raids by hostile
forces from across the border. All
towns that think themselves in dan
ger of local uprising must depend up
on their local authorities first and
upon state authorities next to give
them protection. Federal troops can
not be sent until after National
Guard of state Shall have exhausted
its efforts.
Signed: "FREDERICK-FUNSTON,
"Major General."
: 1 he advantages are many as Clifton
; would be the supply, freighting and
commercial point, not only for the
Mogollon Mining District but for a
large cattle and ranching industry In
I that section.
I Following the return of the com
j mittee Tuesday evening officers of
j the Chamber of Commerce have been
compiling comparative railroad
freight rates ' as between Clifton and
j Silver Citj and this data will be
i placed in the hands of the mine man
j agers at Mogollon for their consider
i ation.
j A Chamber of Commerce dinner is
'also being arranged for which will
probably be given the first week in
April at which time the matter
will be under consideration.
The Clifton-Mogollon road is one
of the best commercial propositions
ever advanced for Clifton and the
agricultural districts of the county.
It is a time, for every public spirited
citizen to put his shoulder to the
wheels of progress and push.

REUNION
BAPTIST CHURCH IS
DEDICATED n
Special Meetings Held During The
Week Were -A Grand Success. ..
About eleven years ago a little
band of Baptist people -,' came to
gether in the Presbyterian . . church
house and under ttys leadership of the
Rev. Geo. W. Brewer, then superin
tendent of Missions for the Baptists of
this State, the organization of the
Clii'ton Baptist church was effected.
The Rev. T. D. Cross became the
first settled pastor, and during the
first three years of its history the
church worshiped in the homes of
its members, rented rooms, and a
big tent, thus handicapped and dis
couraged by many severe testa even
decreasing in numbers instead of in
creasing, yet they forged ahead by
faith.
At the coming of Pastor W. M. Rid
dle in March, 1908, the church begun
to take on new life and plans were
matured for the erection of a meeting
I house and the present commodious
.building is the result.
I ' It was Indeed a happy day when
; they, were permitted to hold the first
.service in the new building, although
'yet unfinished and very meagerly
'equipped,
Mr. Riddle's term of service was
I brief . as was also that of his ofur sue
Icessors, but each of them adding
something- toward the finishing and
equipping of the church home. Since
jthe settlement of the present pastor,
Wm. J.Gordon, who began service in
'.January, 1913, a new five roomvpastor-
ium bas been built, opera chairs in
stalled in the auditorium, the build
ing repainted, cement walks laid and
many items of Sunday school equip
ment have been provided. - Also an
old debt of .$400 on the main building
has been paid, and the . pastorium
debt reduced $350.
It was very fitting indeed that the
former pastor. Rev.' W. M. . Riddle,
who had labored so faithfully in the
early days of construction should be
selected to preach the - dedication
'sermon. It was also very - appro
jpriate that the Rev. T. F. McCourt
: ney, the man who as State Superin
tendent of Baptist Missions, has ren
dered much material and spiritual aid
ito the church during these years of
'struggle, should be selected to make
jthe dedicatory prayer.
The special meetings , began Wed:
nee day the 15th and- anrexcellent pn
gram was rendered each evening,
culminating in the dedicatory services
Sunday. .
Appropriate themes followed each
session and the songs, scripture and
.addresses were selected accordingly,
the first theme was "Our Neighbors"
and the Rev. Geo.W. Hill, of Japan,
was the principal speaker. The second-theme
"Attrustic" and Miss Mary
jSundell, of Phoenix, was the speaker;
the third theme was "Temple Build
ing," and the. Rev.. J. R. Sawyer of
Clifton and Rev. W. M. Riddle of
Globe were the speakers.: The fourth
theme was "Retrospective" and tire
Rev. C. H. Love, Mrs. Alice Spanri,
and Rev. T. F Courtney were the
speakers.
The Sunday morning theme was
"Dedication" and the Sunday,. evening
theme was "Prospective."
A splendid choir directed by . Prof.
George and special songs by Miss
Kent, Miss Noyse, Miss McDowell,
Mrs. George and Mrs.- Davis, contrib
uted largely ot the interest of the
meetings.
The program as a whole was a glow
l(c,a ;dHrP(nes ET T TTAAOOET
ing success and highly appreciated by
all who attended.

jditional details of the finding of the
body or H. J. Mcranney, tne Ameri
can ranch foreman, killed by Villa's
command on its march on Columbus
two weeks ago, today, were reported
to military authorities here tonight.

was nude and terribly mutilated. In
addition to being hanged, McKinney
had been shot numerous times. The
tree from which the body swung was
the only one In a lonely sandy waste
emphasized here and there with' dumps
of sage brush and mesquite. Two
weeks time had obliterated any signs
of the struggle that may have taken
place.
The story of the murder of McKin
ney and two American companions
was told by Mrs. Hattie Wright, wife
of an American ranchman, who, after

CRUDE OIL FREIGHT

NVESTIGATIO
Special Examiner Edgar Watkins for
Interstate Commerce Commission
Is Conducting a Rehearing at Phoe
nix. .
Before Edgar Watkins, special ex
aminer for . the Interstate commerce
commission, a rehearing- was begun
this week in an oil rate case the out
come of ' wWch will be of vast im
portance to the fuel oil consumers of
the-state. The hearing is being held
in the federal court room, and be
sides members of the Arizona corpor
ation commission an imposing array of
counsel ,and rate experts representing
the railway lines which are defend
ants, are present.
The rehearing concerns a complaint
which was originally filed by the Pa
cific Creamery company that the rates
from California producing points to
creamery were excessive, unreasona
ble and unjust. The creamery con
cern alleged that the rates in ques
tion were excessive as compared to
similar hauls from California points
to Utah and Nevada points, and asked
for a reparation or a refund, oovering
the difference between what the com
mission was asked to-determine as a
reasonable rate and the actual rates
claimed as unreasonable. - -
The complaint . charged that the
rates in question were excessive and
mentioned as an ; instance that while
the rate on California points to
Globe, a distance of 900 miles was $6
per ton, the rate per ton for the haul
to Phoenix; a distance of only about
500 miles was $5.50 per ton. The
railways rejoinder was that there was
power competition furnished by the
United States reclamation service at
Globe, and such similar competition
did not exist in Phoenix.
During the forenoon Commissioner
F. A. Jones, Rate Expert A. A.
Betts and Engineer Ben Ferguson of
the corporation commission, and R.
Johnston of the Pacific creamery,
were examined. This afternoon tes
timony in behalf of the carriers is
being heard.
Tricks That are Vain
For tricks that are vain the al
leged bootlegfier is peculiar. Pete
Beruatto, of Morenci, was overhauled
this week by Deputy Sheriff McCul
lough, on a charge of introducing
liquor into the State of Arizona. A
careful inspection of the auto which
was being used as a means of con
veyance disclosed tool boxes and gas
tanks utilized as storage tanks for
the contraband goods. Beruatto was
arraigned before Justice McWilliams
this week and bound over to the Su
perior Court in the sum of $500.00.
