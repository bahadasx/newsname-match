Make P-unczuciiity a Habit.
Somebody said that the man who
was Always on time spent half hia life
waiting for the other man. Perhaps
that is so; yet the fact Is no excuse
for hose who are habitually late. And
really it is quite as easy to be on time
as it is to be late, if we only make
punctuality a habit.

Old
Home Week
tauqtia.
and Cha-
About thirty of the citizens and
business men of Island Pond who
signed the contract for -a guar
antee fund for a Chautauqua to he
held here next summer, presumably
about the first of August, met in the
Y. M. C. A. building for the purpose
of organizing and electing officers
and committees. It was also decided
to have Old Home Week in connec
tion with the Chatauqua in view of
the fact that this year Vermont cel
ebrates its one hundred and twenty
fifth anniversary of being admitted
to the Union. The Greater Vermont
Association is doing all in its power
to bring back to Vermont old time
residents, and it is hoped in this way
that former residents of Island Pond
will be interested and. visit us during
this time. It was also voted that
Island Pond have a clean up and
paint up campaign early this spring
in order to be ready for these tvo
coming events. This work being in
charge of a comittee of five and it is
hoped that as soon as the snow goes
Island Pond will show forth with a
smiling countenance. The Chatau
qua and Old Home Week are two
big items for Island Pond to take
upon its hands, but we are sure that
if enthusiasm and ginger continues
to prevail as in this meeting it will
be a preat success, in view of the
fact that there are seventy-three
signers already. Those who have
not already signed can do so by mak
ing application to A. E. Parlin or L.
A. Cobb. It is hoped that there will
be at least a hundred signers before
the time Ret for this Chautauqua,
this is not an affair, for only a few
individuals but for all the towns
peoplemen, women and children,
and those in the surrounding coun
tries. Everyone can do his or her
little part to put Island Pond back
on the map. Following are the offi
cers and committee chairmen: Pres.,
Dr. A. E. Parlin; vice pres., A. J.
Parent; vice pres., Daniel Stern;
sec, W. F. Morong; treas., L. A.
Cobb; chairman ticket com., A. W.
