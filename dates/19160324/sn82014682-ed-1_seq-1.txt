favor placing a consumption tax of a
half cent a pound on refined sugar.- '
The consumption tax, as -the name
implies, is a tax payable or supposed
ly payable directly by the ultimate
consumer." It is not a tax against
an industry but against the consum
ers of the Industry's product. .u
In the case of the proposed sugar
tax several ways might be devised of
collecting this tar, but the despatch
yesterday indicated that, if. imposed,,
theytax will probably.be taken at the
refineries. This Is In line with i the
government's plan of "collecting aa
near the source "a possible," a plan
followed In tbe collection of the fed
eral Income tax from employers on
the' basis of the pay-rolls showing' the
income of employes.
U. S. Revenue Office Interested. ;
'The consumption. tax.; If imposed,
would probably be collected by the
United States Internal Revenue De
partment Collector Haley of the Ha
waii .district, in response to a query
this morn inc. said that in all probabil
ity the internal revenue offices of the
country would be given the duty of .
securing the revenues.
-The consumption tax Is figured to
reach the consumer the man who
buys sugar for his own -use," said
Collector Haley. "It would, however.
te exceedingly difficult to collect the
tax through the retailer who sells to
the consumer, because of the count
'ess number of stores, large and small,
which would handle sugar.
"While we know nothing officially
of this proposed tax it w.ould seenr
that the tax would be collected at the '
'ef'neries or through the wholesalers.
Very likely Internal revenue stamps
would be issued, as is the case for '
tbe present Internal revenue-taxed
commodities."
Wine Tax Cited As Example.
The present emergency war tax on
wine is virtually a eensumption tax.
Originally it was proposed in Con
gress to collect this tax from, tbe man-'
ufacturer. While the proposal was
being debated the manufacturers were
sending out huge orders to their cus
tomers, so Jthat Congress foresaw its
Inability to realize much revenue
from imposing the tax on the manu
facturer. Hence, the bill was changed !
and the tax imposed on the seller. In
Hawaii the internal revenue office
