MINE INTO SHAPE
WHITE CAPS WILL BE MINING
AND MILLING BV NOT LATER
THAN OCTOBER 1
It Is definitely announced by the
management that the White Caps
Mining company has a method for sue
cessfully treating the ore In that pro
perty, which has been hitherto con
sldered as rebellious, even though Its
values would be highly remunerative
If they could be saved by an Inexpen
sive process.
The method of handling the ore
will be by roasting and cyanlding, at
least that Is the general outline of
the process. There Is a big tonnage
on the dumps and-a large quantity Is
blocked out In the mine.
Within the next sixty days the vein
should be encountered on the. S10
level, putting another big block In
sight. The management has Increased
the force by adding a second shift.
The mill will be equipped with Its
complete process and the mine will be
In Bhape for heavy extraction by not
later than October 1st. The company
is now clear of Indebtedness and Is
backed by substantial Interests.

realm, and to conduct scientific work.
The expedition was financed by In
dividual gifts, together with $.10,000

handsome profits. Here the metal Is
known as scbeelite, or tungstate of
lime, and it is found in large quantities
In the ledge matter. The company baa
recently erected a plant and is ship

ROTTERDAM, Netherlands, Mar. 24.
A stir has been made In the Dutch
metal Industries by the latest Ger
man export measure, which amounts
to the annullment of running contrncts
of Dutch firms with the German Iron
foundries and threatens the firms in
question with the loss of millions of
dollars.
Many of them are already turning
to England and Scotland for their raw-
Iron supplies, and would doubtless
place big orders In America hut for the
abnormal freights.

WASHINGTON, Ma'r. 24. Consul Letcher of Chihuahua has re
ported that there Is no truth In the reported revolt of Hen-era', al
though General Funston and General Bell, on the border, received
reports confirming the revolt. The Letcher dispatch is taken as con
firmation of the statements of Carranza officials that no revolt has
occurred.
His report 1b regarded as removing one of the most menacing fea
tures of the Mexican situation.
A telegram from D. A. Richardson of Douglas, saying that Mexican troops
are massing across the line from Douglas, suggesting that the Columbus mas
sacre could easily be repeated at Douglas, asking for "Help before It it too
late" was made public by Senator Ashurst. Ashurst said, "Useless to sub
mit the telegram to the senate. I am tired of trying to get anything done."

H. H. WEIR AND COLONEL BILL
MOODY OF GOLDFIELD AC
QUIRE POSSESSION
Just about the two tiredest, hungri
est, thirstiest and most disreputable
looking people ever seen in Tonopah
rolled in last night and as soon as they
had fed and bedded down their auto
they did the same for themselves at
the Mizpah.
Messrs. Moody and Weir had been
out for a week on the hardest kind
of a campaign, bucking snow and mud
and making a trail for themselves for
the last twenty-five miles of their
Journey. But they were happy even
if fatigued, for they came back with
a sack containing a hundred pounds
or more of the richest sort of cinna
bar, Borne of which, when weighed in
and out of water, showed values
around sixty per cent, and not in
small chunks at that.
They went to a property twenty-
five miles from Bridges station on the
Nevada Central railroad, ten miles
south of Kane springs and about 45
miles northwest of Austin. The pro
perty, they report, has been explored
successfully for 700 feet In length and
forty feet In width. It Is an altered
lime quartzite formation and is be
lieved to run several per cent across
its entire width. The "property was
bonded by the visitors for a sum
not given out except that it was said
to reach six figures. They will re
turn in a few days and start develop
ment work.
The upraise from the Victor cross
cut is now within twenty feet of the
point where It will meet the winze
that was sunk from the 1350 level of
the Extension.
Both headings are in ore of consider
ably higher grade than the average
for the camp. The Murray ledge at
this point is 37 feet in width and all
will mill. As soon as this connection
is made drifts will be started from
the Victor 1540 and the extraction of
ore will be limited only to the ca
pacity of the mill, enlargement of
which is now in progress.
