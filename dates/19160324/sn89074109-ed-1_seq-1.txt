Splendid Success
.Annual Event Under Auspices of Lo
cal K. C. Organization Was Splen
did Success—Large Audience
Gave Liberal Applause.
"Misther O'Callahan" the two act
'Comedy given under the auspices of
the Knights of Columbus at the
Beach Opera House last Friday eve
.ning was greeted by a packed house
standing room being at a premium,
and the play scored a big hit with
the audience.
The play was full of amusing and
mirth provoking situations and the
continuous laughter from the aud
ience showed that the situations
were fully appreciated. The mem
bers of the cast all of them being
.home talent, acquitted themselves in
•a most creditable manner, but Mar
tin Egan in the title role of "Misther
O'Callahan" was easily a blue rib
bon winner. Those who have seen
ihirn play the part of an Irish com
edian, before say that he out did all
previous records.
Miss Frances Matter and John
Power played the parts of the lov
*ers, Julia Banks and Charles Riv
ers and next to "Misther O'Calla
han" himself they were the central
figures in the play and so well did
they carry their parts that there
was nothing lacking to give them
a true to life aspect.
H. B. Burt, .-is Mr. Rivers should
•especial adaptability to his part and
handled the dramatic situations re
markably well.
Miss Kathryn Lee as Mrs. Mon
tague played the part of the coquet
tish widow very well and her splen
did acting contributed much to the
success of the plot.
Frank McCormick played in ex
cellent manner the part of Dr. Banks
who had been estranged from his
wife.
Among the minor parts were Miss
Alice Kohlars as Betty, the maid,
Miss Marie Loelie as the estranged
wife of Dr. Banks John McCarthy
•as Mr. Rivers' servant and Ray
Richard as butler at the academy,
all of whom played their parts with
a grace that added much to the suc
cess of the play.
Several specialties were put on
before the play and between the
scenes and acts and these helped
to keep things lively.
The opening number was a vocal
solo "I Want a Girl for Every Month
in the Year," by Mr. McCormick,
accompanied by twelve "pretty
Beach dancers," who were dressed
-to represent the months of the year.
The twelve girls in the order of the
months of the year: the Misses
Alice Kohlars, Frances Matter, Ei
lene Madison, Fannie Abrams, So
phia Johnson, Mary Pelka, Ragna
Xiiind, Kate McCormick, Margaret
Witzig, Buclila Dillv and Isabel Crol
ley. The song and dance made
such a hit with the audience that
"•they were forced to respond with
an encore.
Ilarry P. Burt gave a vocal selec
tion entitled, "Ireland is Ireland to
Me" and responded to an encore
with "Molly Dear, It's You I'm Af
ter" while George Purvis sang "Be
lieve Me All Those Endearing Young
Charms" and responded to the en
core with "My Rose of Old KUdair."
Mike Moran as Prof. O'Grady of
Dublin gave a splendid exhibition of
the Irish jig and proved beyond a
'doubt that he is an artist in that
t'ne. The audience was not satis
lied with one appearance and he hid
to give a second exhibition in order
to quiet the applause.
The final number was an exhibi
tion of the Spanish dance by Mrs.
Jas. G. Burke. She was attired as
a Spanish maiden and the dance
made a decided hit with the audience,
she also being called on for an en
core.
A great deal of credit for the suc
cess of the play is due Mrs. Marie
Loebe, under whose direction it was
given and also to Mrs. Burke who
drilled the young ladies taking part
in the opening dance.
After the program an enjoyable
and well attended dance was given.
We understand that there is a
move on foot to produce "Misther
'O'Callahan" at Wibaux in the very
near future.

HIBITION BEFORE
PEOPLE CIRCULATED
Bismarck, X. D., March 24.—The
Personal Liberty League has been
circulating peitions to refer the pro
hibition amendment to the consti
tution for the past three weeks.
Their agents have been busy in
a number of counties and it is re
ported on reliable authority that
they have secured sufficient sign
ers in ten counties.
In order to place this amendment
on the ballot for repeal they must
secure 25 per cent of the legal vot
ers' signatures in tweutysix coun
ties.
It is proposed to substitute for the
present prohibition amendment the
Gothenburg system of handling in
toxicating liquor9. This system is
now in use in the Scandinavian
countries and discourages the use
of spirituous liquors in favoc of
light and malt liquors.
Medora Bridge to
'be Opened in July
Big Frontier Celebration Planned
By Committee in Charge. Cele
bration Will Continue For Two
Days, July 24th, and 25th, and
Will Be Big Event.
Dickinson, Nov. 21.—The "Bridge
that Boost Built," spanning the Lit

opened July 24th and 25th, with
fitting ceremonies and with a feast
of attractions which is expected to
bring hundreds of touring parties
from all. of the states traversed by
the lied Trail.
Dates for the event which will
mark so important a milestone in
the life of the National Parks Trans
continental highways were set at the
first annual meeting of the associa
tion held in Fargo this week. The
latter part of July was selected for
the dedicatory exercises as the sea
son when good weather will be most
certain when crops will least in
terfere with the attendance of far
mers along the highway, and when
travel over the trail to the Yellow
stone national parks will be at its
height.
Medora promises a replica of the
famous frontier day and rodia which
is staged last summer as a special
feature for the two days' celebra
tion. The Billings county seat, ona
of the last of the old-time cow
towns, has at its command the very
best talent in America it has at
its command the very best talent in
America it has a splendid natural
amphitheatre, and it is believed that
with the advertising and publicity
which the Red Trail association ex
pects to give the event thousands
of tourists from all parts of the
middle west can be induccd to at
tend.
The committee, headed by J. P.
llmciy, which is to have charge of
the general arrangements will meet

Minnesota, North Dakot.t and Mon

tives of other states, will participate
and the other states will participate

business world will be enlisted.
There is an excellent possibility that
Theodore Roosevelt, an old-time
Medora citizen may me "among those
present and that lie may be per

he may have retained with the rope.

Murray's work in "A Game Old

to
be seen next Tuesday
at the Opera House, such a rare
creation, resembling in its origina
lity the burlesques that delighted our
forefathers.
Murray and his Keystone asso
ciates in the farce feature of the
Triangle program at the Opera
House have succec^ed in extracting
every last laugh out of the story of
a wandering knight who seeks to
wed the young and pretty princess
when King Mike XIU, and his elder
and uglj daughter desire him for
her consort. Torture chambers to
bring the knight to terms are hand
led in such a way as to rouse the
rlsibles of an audience. The knight
finally shows that he is game by
marrying the ugly princess after she
has saved bis life in the old mill
chamber of the torture headquar

Report Troops
Entering Mexico
First Associated Press Dispatch
From Army Across Border
El Paso, Tex., March 23.—The
following dispatch from an Asso
ciated Press correspondent at the
front in Mexico is the first complete
story of the crossing of the puni
tive expedition sent to avenge the
Columbus massacre:
Headquarters U. S. Punitive Ex
pedition Near Colonia, Dublan, Chi
huahua, Mexico, March 22 (via wa
gon train to Columbus, N. M., March
-3)—Reaching here by a forced
march that demonstrated the en
durance of the American soldiers
and obviously amazed the Mexicans,
several thousand United States so
diers, troops of cavalry, infantry
and artillery were scattered today
between this point and the northern
boundary of the district of Guerrero
intent on the task of capturing or
killing of Francisco Villa in the
shortest possible time and extermin
ating the bandit band by which he
raided ^olunibus, N. M., and slaugh
tered nine civilians on March !.
Troop movements and dispositions
however, it was said were shrouded
in the strictest secrecy by order of
the war department.
The entry into Mexico occurred at
12:07 p. m., March 15. At that mo
ment the American colors with the
standard of the 13th cavalry were
carried over the boundary. Colonel
Herbert Slocum commanding the
thirteenth cavalry, was the first
commanding officer to cross. He
was .ile.w by Major .lames Ryan
acting chief of staff to General John
Pershi ig, V'ho co ii.minds the puni
tive •jxpc'iron.
This wi'S the column No. eon
xistinjf of .iitillery ci.valry am' in
fantiv a id heavily burdened with
wagon t.'ji ns. It moved slowly and
camped the first night at PaIo!.,tas, a
filthy village of adobe huts and go
downs, even miles below the boun
dary.
CoIi.iin.i No 12 cnt'red Mexie.t from
Culberson's ranch, 51 miles -south of
llachita, X. Jr. General I'ershing,
who had accompanied the first col
umn part of the way to l'alomas,
returned to Columbus the same aft
ernoon, raced to Culberson in an au
to and taking command of the se
cond Hying column, drove it more
than 110 miles over the desert of
Chihuahua in 22 hours' actual mar
clung time.
Offical records show spies dotted
the route of the first column but the
men of the second had forked their
way 50 miles into the country be
fore a second single native was seen
and to the patent surprise of the
Mexicans, reached here Friday night
exactly 42 hours after crossing the
border at 3:17 Thursday morning.
.Slocum halted the column at the
border gate south of Columbus until
colors came up. When he crossed
the boundary into Mexico, Major
Thompkins, a brother of the noted
lieutenant, Colonel Tommy Thomp
kins of the 7th cavalry, spread out
his advance guard. In the form of
a wide fan the riders of the guard
galloped southward. The temper of
the Mexicans still was a matter of
speculation. There were officers
who would not have been surprised
to see the entry of the United States
forces opposed at the boundary.
But there were no Mexicans at
the border gate or none was seen on
the march to Palomas. Only two
bodies of armed men were cncourt
ed by either of the columns on the
march south. At Ascencion the
mayor, Raymond II. Gomez, had 100
Carranza soldiers and he told Col
onel Slocum he did not know whe
ther to fight or let the American col
umn pass on peacefully.
After an exchange of official visits
during w..%* he observed at the
American cainp the assembly of men
and guns, Gomez decided to accept
the United States army officers'
statement that Carranza had agreed
to the entry of the troops unopposed.
The other body of troops was en
countered here Saturday, March 18,
Major Reyes, who said he was pro
ceeding to Casas GrShdes from Ma
dera after scouting for Villa* was
startled to see American troops in
this vicinity. His men referred to
them as "yellow jackete." He stop
ped one of the guides of the column
and asked to he taken to the Amer
ican commander to assure him that
his force consisting of 30 men were
not "Villistas," and in turn he as
sured they would not be fired on.

state school fund by the sale of
lands in Cass, Sargent, Richland,
Steele and Walsh county according

tal receipts in the sale of 16,745.82
acres to be $483,009.80. The lands
were the poorest of the state school
properties in the several counties,
and had, at various times, been pre
viously offered for sale, bids, how
ever, up to the appraised value, nev
er having been received.
All told, there now remain only
4,200 acres of unsold state school
lands in the five Red river valley
counties indicated.
All of the land just sold will he
added to the tax rolls of the current
year and will add materially to the
revenue of the counties. The high
est average value of land sold was
in Steele county, while the highest
price paid for any tract was in Sar
gent, where $53 an acre was paid.
The last public school land sale
to be held this year is in Burleigh
