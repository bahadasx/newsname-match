Max S. I landman, M. U.
Sociologist, Takes Up As
pects of Present Society.
GIVES THREE VIEWS
Speaker Advocates Spending
Time in Serious Consid
eration of Life.
The Individualist, tin conservative
and tli si" iologist mi'l in coiillict In a
lecture by Max S. Ilaiidnian of the
sociology department last night in tin'
University Auditoriiiin.
First, tlic stolid conservative and tlie
man with individualistic ideas met and
talked Mr. Conservative contended
that tli country was going to the
dogs; that laborers, with no respect
for law. order or contracts, struck, and
declared lliat tluir employers' prop
erty was theirs (The idea! When it
was inherited!) that wives left hus
bands who had good moral qualities
and who gave them yachts and motor
cars; Anally, that the institutions of
the famih and private property were
of divine origin and should remain
intact.
"Human Nut .Made for Institutions."
" lliave more sympathy." said the
individualist, "for the wives and the
strikers than 1 have for existing Institution.-,
rliat exist just because they
do exist. You do not see the injustice
of a man's treating his wife as if she
were a yacht or a motor car or of men
having to starve to get justice.
Humans w. re not made for institu
tions; they were made free and un
tramuu'lt'd." enable to agree, the two went to a
sociologist, lie told them they were
both wrong, and that if ho did try to
lieli. tin in, they would throw stones at
Idiii. Finally he consented to talk and
this is what he said:
All llad on Assumptions.
"The solution lies in the social or
der that knows how much freedom it
can allow to the individual and the in
stitution, at the same time assuring
constant development. The family is
based on the assumption that there is
a deep and fundamental difference be
tween worn n and men; private prop
erty, that there is a difference between
men. What effects do these assump
tions have?" he asked the individual
ist "Oh," replied that person. "Woman
has no personality; she is a living
sacrifice."
"Isn't sacrifice a beautiful thing?"
queried the conservative.
"Just try it," retorted the individual
ist "These assumptions," went on the
sociologist, "have caused the exploita
tion of tin- poor by the rich. They have
justified great nations for pouncing
on weaker oils, because they dignified
the pouncing by calling it 'coloniza
tion.' When other nations asked for a
share of their loot, they held them off
with the cry of 'patriotism.'
"Work too Long and Too Fast."
"The difference between men and
women, rich and poor, white and
black, is due to institutions. As they
are, they push and crowd human or
ganisms, which they will ultimately
destroy. People work too long and too
fast, and resort to saloons and cheap
dance halls, because the economic in
stitution makes no ..rovision for play.
"I'eople can't think for fear of in
stitutions. They exhaust themselves
keeping track of what they can do, or
die trying. Human relations change
and institutions must express these
changes."
The conservative said, "Why, this
is rabid nonsense, lie is a dangerous
character."
And the individualist, "Why, he is
a reactionary, lie wants to give up
lnor institutions than we have."

late yesterday afternoon against their
opponents, Jane Donncll and Lilly

Then retaliation played its part, and
the alleged offenders filed against
their accusers this morning on the
same charge. All four were lined si

this morning. Each seemed satisfied
with the final outcome of the "war
fare" and agreed on "quits."

IN SEfflCHOF "DOPE"
"Fiend" Makes Frequent
Visits to Offices in Ex

HE LEAVES NO CLEW
Police Have Been Unable to
Learn Identity of Noc
turnal Prowler.
Columbia has a "dope liend" who
for the last two or three weeks has
made almost nightly tours of the of
fices or the doctors in the Exchange
National Bank Building in an attempt
to get morphine tablets or other opi
ates out of their desks. I.ast night he
broke into several desks in the build
ing and attempted to break into the
de.sk of Dr. Guy L. Xoyes.
"This has been happening for some
time," said Doctor Xoyes this morn
ing. "This is the first time that the
person has broken into my desk, but
he has broken into Dr. Max Y Mycr's
desk in this suite several times and
into other doctors' desks in the build
ing. The opiate law evidently has
finally shut off his source of supply,
and he is forced to steal morphine
tablets from doctors in order to ap
pease the habit.
"He always succeeds in getting a
few morphine tablets, as he goes to
the office of every doctor until he
does. Some night he is going to get
something else in a morphine hypoder
mic tube, and then he will be able to
tell who the marauder is."
The police have been notified of the
raids but have been unable to find a
clew to the prowler.

they are today breathing the fresh
spring air, say railroad men who strug

if the train had been going fast there
would have been dead and wounded
instead of merely scared passengers.
The engine was put back ou the tiack

'ihe train, which was in charge ot
Engineer C. E. Cox and Conductor M.

had flagged the train. Suddenly the

did not leave the track, and after the

Centralia was then called upon for
an engine. At Centralia a coach was
attached to the relief engine and pas

whence they walked to town.
Tho passengers bound for Centra

to the switch was found open, aim, ac
cording to J. A. Cook, train master of
Moberly, who came liei: to help, it
must have been opened by someone
having a special railroad switch key.
When asked if the derailment may
have been caused by negligence of
working men, who have been laying

did not think so.

HAY BIlLJS PASSED
House Adopts Measure In
creasing Mobile Strength
of Army to 140,000.
I!y t'niteil Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 24.
The Hay bill, providing for the re
organization of the army, increase of
the mobile forces to 140,000 men and
greater efficiency, passed the House
late yesterday by a vote of 402 to 2.
Representatives Fred A. Britton (Rep.)
of Chicago and Meyer Loudon (Soc.)
of New York cast the only dissenting
votes.
The measure now goes to the Sen
ate, where it will be taken up at once
in conjunction with the Chamberlain
bill, which provides for a minimum
of 17G.000 men.
That the House may be persuaded
eventually to accept a bill providing
for a larger standing army was dem
onstrated by a record vote on the
Kahn amendment, proposing an army
of 220,000 men. This amendment was
defeated by a vote of 213 to 191, a ma
jority of only 22. The "big" army
strength In the House was a surprise
to the author of the amendment. The
Kahn amendment had been defeated
during debate on the bill in Commit
tee of the Whole, but the House agreed
by unanimous consent to have a roll
call on the proposal before final pass
age of the army bill today.
The large vote for the Kahn amend
ment strengthens the belief that when
the Senate and House send their re
spective army bills to conference the
compromise bill may provide for an
army of 100,000 or more men. On the
Kahn amendment 34 Republicans
voted against the big army plan and
3 Democrats voted for it.
