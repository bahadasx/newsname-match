BY DR. PATTON
Instrument, Weighing 1400
Pounds Is Expected Here
This Week.

Machine Modern.
The largest X-Ray machine in
Southern Missouri has been purchased
from the Stattick X-Ray company of
Hammond, Ind., by Dr. W. C. Patton
of this city, and is expected to reach
the Cape this week. It will be in
stalled in Dr. Patton's office in the
Cahoon building.
The instrument weighs 1,400 pounds,
which is the standard .?ize of the
x-rays used in all of the eastern hos
pitals. The device carries with it an
attachment known as the "high fre
quency resonater," which makes it
possible for the instrument to in
crease its tension of electricity up to
a million volts.
The machine will be the only x-ray
equipment in Cape Girardeau and one
of the few in this section of the State.
A pamphlet sent to The Tribune by
the Indiana company, which sold the
machine to Dr. Fatton, gave a descrip
tion of the instrument. A part of the
equipment makes it possible for pho
tographs made by the machine to be
developed in the physician's office.
According to the information sent
out by the Stattick company, the x-ray
is being used with much success in
the treatment of kidney diseases.
Bright's disesae, one of the most seri
ous of the kidney ailments, is cured
by this instrument, unless the disease
has reached an acute state of develop
ment. The x-ray is used in the Eastern
cities in the treatment of all chronic
diseases, especially nervous and func
tional disorders, and its results have
been marvelous.
When asked about the machine last
night, Dr. Patton said: "I do not feel
at liberty to discuss it for publication,
but I should be glad to explain it to
you privately when it reaches here."
Both Dr. Patton and his assistant,
Dr. J. C. Vorbeck, arc expert opera
tors of the x-ray. It is supposed that
the machine will be used in the treat
ment of diseases as well as for the
purposes of making photographs in
diagnosing diseases.
DR. ROLSTON BACK HOME.
Physician Arrives on Boat Must
Rest Month Before Practicing.
Dr. and Mrs. W. T. Rolston yester
day arrived home in the Cape on the
Str. Cape Girardeau from St. Louis,
where for several weeks Dr. Rolston
was a patient in the Missouri Baptist
Sanitarium.
The doctor for several weeks had
been suffering with a circulatory dis
order and he went to St. Louis with
Mrs. Rolston to have a thorough ex
amination made by specialists there.
For some time he has been out of the
hospital and staying at the home of
Mrs. Rolston's parents in St. Louis.
On his arrival in the Cape the doc
tor told his friends that he has virtu
ally recovered from the malady with
which he suffered, but his physicians
have ordered him to rest at his home
for another month before he attempts
to return to his practice.

Mr. England yesterday told his
friends he is having a difficult time
finding a suitable house for a residence
because of the fact that all are occu
pied. He declared that he had been

location before coming to the Cape,
and he declared that he likes tha Cap

FATHER COLLINS
EXPOSESWORKOF
AN ENGLISH SPY
Jackson Priest Publishes Re
port Made to Grey on
U.S.
KING'S AGENT SAID
WILSON WAS WOODEN
Revealed Efforts to Force U. S.
to Declare War on
Germany.
Father M. D. Collins, pastor of the
Catholic church at Jackson, has pub
lished in circular form a copv of an
English spy's report to London on
conditions existing in the United
States. This report, which was taken
from the Congressional record at
Washington, reveals the inside work
ings of the British government in its
efforts to force the United States into
war against Germany.
The spy's report, which was made
to Sir Edward Grey, calls President
Wilson a "wooden President" and
urges England to "let him win a dip
lomatic victory now and then in order
to please him."
In this communication the spy com
pliments the British government on
its success in controlling the newspa
pers in the United States, but asks
Sir Edward Grey to put a damper on
the New York Tribune, because it has
become too strong for the British.
"Its pro-allv campaign destrovs its
usefulness," the spy says, "because it
is too friendly to the British." King
George's gum shoe artist says the best
results are obtained by newspapers
which sometimes criticize the English
government.
Father Collins, in commenting upon
the spy's report, says The Cape Girar
deau Tribune is the only daily news
paper published in this part of the
country that has enough courage to
criticize the efforts" of the British and
their paid American agents to force
the United States into war with Ger
many. The spy's report in full follows:
"To the Right Hon. Sir Edward Grey.
"Sir: I have the honor to report
that I have brought to a conclusion the
investigation which your Excellency
instructed me to make. Following is
a brief summary of the results ob
tained: the details are duly listed in
the accompanying schedules.
The General Sentiment of the
American Pvople.
"Washington may still be classed as
completely on our side. The Admin
istration has been packed so carefully
with British sympathizers that the
strongest social pressure can be, and
is being, brought to bear upon neu
trals. Members of Congress who are
recalcitrant are being brought to a
proper sense of their duty by feminine
and social influence. The policy is
full of hope, and should be crowned
with complete success in a short per
iod. These facts are, of course already
well known to your Excellency, and
are only inserted here to complete the
document.
"Boston, Providence and New Eng
land generally may be described as
favorable. Here cultural and racial
considerations reinforce the social.
Our consul in Providence is in con
stant touch with Mr. John Revelstoke
Rathom. It seems that the other side
has investigated his past to a con
siderable extend. The facts unearthed
by them in connection with a poison
candy scandal in San Francisco have
considerably impaired Mr. Rathom's
usefulness in Washington.
"In this connection I cannot urge
too strongly upon your Excellency to
take some action that would check the
injudicious partisanship for our cause
shown by the New York Tribune. By
being more British than His Majesty's
Government itself, the Tribune has
practically destroyed its usefulness.
I suggest a policy far more subtle in
quality such as is revealed by a study
of editorial columns of the New York
Times. While backing the interests of
Great Britain in every vital matter,
the New York Times has not hesitated
at times to attack us vigorously. This
establishes for that excellent paper a
reputation for fearlessness and inde
pendence that is invaluable to us. On
the other hand I suggest that means
be found to suppress such articles as
the editorial in the Journal of Com-

Overstreet and Bowman Confer
With Architect on Build
ing Plans.
John M. Overstreet, heir and exe
cutor of the Col. P. H. Van Frank
estate, which owned the Riverview
hotel, and Arthur C. Bowman last
night held a conference with M. E.
Worcester, architect, discussing plans
for the new hotel building that will be
erected on the site of the burned
structure.
Mi Overstreet last night discussed
the question of building with white
glazed terra cotta blocks with the
architect and Mr. Bowman, and said
that the work on the new building will
commence as soon as possible.
"I expect to order men to start to
work clearing away the debris on the
sidewalks at once," Mr. Bowman said
last night, "and we are going to pro
ceed with the hotel as rapidly as it
will be possible.
"The situation is absolutely un
changed. We h'ave made final ar
rangements with the insurance com
pany whereby we will recover the full
face value of the $15,009 policies car
ried on the building and contents, and
we expect to go ahead.
"We have not received the money in
cash yet, but the settlement has been
arranged upon. The settlement was
delayed a short time by reason of the
fact that it was necessary to furnish
itemized invoices on the furnishings
in the hotel which were covered by the
insurance policies.
"I had to name the costs on all the
equipment we had and it required
extra time to obtain those figures.
"We are dickering with the archi
tect now and in a general way the
plans for the structure will be the
same as has been outlined."

TO TRY CAPE COAL
RATE CASE APR. 14
Hearing Before Commerce Com
mission Examiner Will Be
At Cairo, III.
The fifteen-cent advance in the rail
road rate upon coal into Cape Girar
deau from the Marion, 111., field will
come up for a hearing before an In
terstate Commerce Commission exam
iner in Cairo April 14, according to
information which has been received
in the Cape by Charles L. Harrison,
chairman of the Traffic Committee of
the Commercial Club.
An examiner last Friday heard sev
eral coal rate cases in St. Louis and
at that time it was believed the Cape
Girardeau case would be considered,
but at the opening of the hearing the
examiner ruled that only cases involv
ing shipments through what is known
as the St. Louis gateway would be
heard at that time.
The coal shipments into the Cape
do not come by way of St. Louis, so
that the Cape's case was not consid
ered there. Announcement was made
that for the Cape's case, involving
shipments over the Thebes bridge, the i
hearing will be held in Cairo in April. '
Under a resolution of the Commer
cial Club authorizing Attorney I. R.
Kelso to employ such additional coun
sel as he deemed necessary in the con
duct of the case, George B. Webster
of St. Louis, an attorney specializing
in that kind of work, has been retain
ed to represent the Cape.
He already has filed an intervening
suit with the Commission in the Cape's
coal rate case. Under a contract made
with the city in 1011, the Frisco
agreed to ship coal into this city at
the rate of 60 cents from the Marion,
111., field.
At that time the C. & E. I. and
Frisco were operated in such a man
ner that the rate was saeceszfully
carried out. The two roads subsc-
;quently hare been divorced in man-

Geo Burroughs,
Absent 27 Years,
Visits The Cape
Calls on Billy Bohnsack and
They Hark Back to Bare
foot Days When Cape Gir
ardeau Was But a Village.
George Burroughs, brother of the
late jurist, Frank Burroughs, arrived
in Cape Girardeau yesterday after an
absence of 27 years. He was born in
this county and grew to manhood in
this city. Ho was employed by Louis
Houck for several years before he
went East in 1S:.
William H. Bohnsack Jr., the mer
chant, know Burroughs as a boy and
they were young men together. Yes
terday afternoon Mr. Burroughs called
at the Main street store to x-hat about
old times in the Cape with Mr. Bohn
sack. He recognized Mr. Bohnsack, but
Mr. Bohnsack saw ; nothing familiar
about Mr JJurroughL- "I don't bet
lieve you remember me, Bill," re
marked Burroughs as he extended his
hand.
"You speak familiarlv, but vour
face is foreign to me," replied the
merchant.
"I'm Bui roughs George Bur
roughs." "Burroughs!" exclaimed Mr. Bohn
sack. That name brought back the
days when they were barefoot boys
together. He could see the circus
wagons winding down the road.
"Where under the sun have vou
been ail these vears '
demanded
Bohnsack.
"Why, in New York, where all of
the big money men are, of course,"
replied Burroughs.
Bohnsack and Burroughs recalled
old times in the Cape when they
went snipe hunting along the creeks
which used to ripple down the hills
that aro now dotted with homes and
stores. That was forty years ago.
"Has she grown any, George?"
Bohnsack asked, speaking, of course,
of Cape Girardeau.
"Grown? Why she's simply grown
into a short pants edition or little old
New Yoik. Had I glided into town in
an aeroplane, I would have sworn we
got off at the wrong station. There's
nothing familiar about the Cape, ex
cept you and the Mississippi river.
You look younger than you did when
I left here 27 years ago, and you
haven't lost a hair."
For two hours they swapped tales
of the old times, when Cape Girar
deau had only a few hundred people
and they fished in a brook where
Main street now is.
They didn't finish their conversation,
but will hold another session today,
