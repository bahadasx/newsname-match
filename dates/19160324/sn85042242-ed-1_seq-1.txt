STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF MEXICAN TROOPS IS
CAUSING UNEASINESS AMONG THE
COMMANDING OFFICIALS.
El Paso, March 23.—General Luis Huerrea has revolt­
ed from General Carranza and has declared that he will
resist with all his power the entry of American troops in­
to Mexico, but is still opposed to Villa, according to re
ports from sources believed to be reliable.
General Funston transmitted to the
war department, the message from
General Bell, and awaited anxiously

state department has begun through
its consular representatives in Chi­
huahua, Torreon and Durango.

Nor was General F'unston's knowl­
edge of the progress of General Per­
shing's columns increased. The day
passed without a report from General
Pershing, making this the fouVh day
General Funston has been ignorant of
developments south of Casas Gran
des. He sent General Pershing's in­
structions today to send more com­
plete information regarding develop­
ments and another message warning
him of reported activities of Huerria.
fteceipt of his communication was ac­
knowledged at Casas Grandes, but
late today the reports had been re­
ceived.
The news of Htierrea's revolt was considered sufficiently authen­
tic for GVneral Bell to telegraph (Jeneral Funston at San Antonio
that, he believed it to be true, lie added to the message, how­
ever, the emphatic denial of the revolt issued here by (Jeneral
(Jareifl, which was supported by telegrams said to have been re­
ceived from (Jeneral Huerrea and (Jeneral (iutierrez, Carranza's

Gavira said that the Villa troops were
routed and fled toward Namiquipa
and that forces of General Luis Guti­
errez went in pursuit to give Villa fur­
ther battle.

Reaching here by a forced march that
demonstrated the endurance of the
American soldier and obviously amaz­
ed the Mexicans, several thousands of
United States troops, cavalry, infantry

burdened with heav: wagon trains, it
moved slowly and camped the first

ed to Culberson in :.n automobile, and

over the desert, of Chihuahua in 22
hours actual march ng time.
Many Spies On Route.
Official records show tha spies
dotted the route ot the first column,
but the men of the second had forged
their way into the country for over 15
miles before a single native was seen
and to the patent surprise of the Mex­
icans reached here Friday night, ex­
actly 42 hours after crossing the bor­
der at 3:17 Thursday morning.
Colors First.
Colonel Slocum halted the column
at the border gate south of Columbus,
until the colors came up. When these
had crossed the boundary into Mexico,
Major Tompkins, a brother of the not­
ed lieutenant colonel, "Tommy Tomp­
kins" of the 7th Cavalry, spread out
his advance guard, in the form of a
wide fan, the riders of the guard gal­
loped southward. The temper of the
Mexicans still was a matter of specu­
lation. There were officers who would
not have been surprised to see the
entry of the United States forces op­
posed at the boundary.
No Effort Made to Annoy.
But there were no Mexicans at the
border gate and none were seen on
the march to Palomas. Only two
bodies of armed men were encounter­
ed by either of the columns on the
march south. At Ascension the may
or. Gomez, had 100 Carranza soldiers,
and told Col. Slocum he did not Know
whether to fight or let the American
column pass on peaceably.
After an exchange of official visits,
during which he observed at the
American camp, the assemply of men
and guns, Gomez decided to accept
the United States army officer's state­
ment that Carranza had agreed to the
entry of the troops unopposed.
Called Troops "Yellow Jackets."
The other body of troops was en­
countered here Saturday, March 18th.
Major Reyes, who said he was pro­
ceeding to f!asas Grandes from Ma­

startled to see American troops in

them as "yellow jackets." He stop­

TRIBUNE SERVICE.
The Tribune is the only paper in the
state which this morning gives its
readers returns from about 1,000_pre­
cincts in the state. No other paper
in the state has yet published anf
state returns on the delegate ticket.
The results given this morning are
official, having been gathered fr^m
the county auditors' offices. The few
precincts missing cannot change re­
sults materially except in the Bruej
ger-Perry fight.
Bruegger Leads By 274.
In one of the closest races known
in democratic circles, Bruegger has
overtaken Perry and leads him by
several laps. It seems likely that
the, Williston democrat will be suc­
cessful, as tlie strong Perry counties
are all in. Returns from 110® pre­
cincts in the slate out of a total.oC
LS-flO precincts give Bryegger 3,341,
Perry :t,t)C7, and Olson (William)*
Delegation Divided.
Col. C. II. Little among the repub­
lican candidates for delegate to na­
tional convention holds second place,
with Claude C. Turner of Dickinson
leading the ticket. Tt. seems practi­
cally certain that four of the dele­
gates selected by the republican
state central committee are elected,
while six put up by the progressive
republican league make up the bal­
ance. There is a chance that 'Luther
Walton of Oarrington, a committee
selection, can nose E. A. Bowman out.
Gunder Olson Winner.
(hinder Olson is maintaining his
lead over Lemke and LaFollette is
running a little better than two tp
one over Estabrook.
The returns from more than 1,000
of the 1,80-0 precincts of the state are
practically decisive. Those mising
will not affect materially the results
as shown in another column.
Olson Causes Perry Defeat.
Perry's apparent defeat is credited
to the candidacy of William Olson
of Valley City, who drew more votes
from Perry than from Bruegger. His
candidacy split the Equity members
in the Perry country. The advent of
Olson at the eleventh hour on the
democratic ticket is regarded as a
Bruegger coup and shows emphatic­
ally how the primary can be manip­
ulated by the political schemers.
Total results are found in another
column.
