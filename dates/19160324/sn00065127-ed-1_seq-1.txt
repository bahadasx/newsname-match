contestants ID its various phases and
from the various standpoints. Prohi
bition, both in South Dakota and the
nation was dealt with, and It would
have been well if it had been possible
for more South Dakotans to have
heard these orations. Proof was giv
en that neither the state nor the na
tion would lose anything financially
by taking the licensed saloon out of
its midst. As it is. we säffer the
sbanoe of having it in our midst, and
we will some day have to account for
this.
The contestants all did very well,
and the markings show that the con
test was very close between several of
the speakers. The delivery of all was
very good, and they showed prospects
of some day ranking as orators of
which the state and nation may be
proud.
Isaac Gronlid, the winner of lirst
place, with his oration "The Demand
of the Age" was very eloquent, and
he placed before tbe people the de
mand ot our age to eradicate tbe li
censed saloon at our next election.
Lily Iverson with her oration, "The
Porter of Hell Gate," won second
place, and she pointed out distinctly
that if we let the porter once let us
in thru the gate, it will be very diffi
cult to ever get out again. So let us
not allow him to open the gate, by
permitting the saloon to exist. Miss
Iverson spoke very distinctly and
forcibly, and showed that tho girls
need never fear of ever "taking a back
seat.''

The sermon last Sunday evening
was certainly a rare treat. Dr. Jenkins
presented the cause of the Veteran
minister. His accounts of the trials
and experiences of some of these early
laborers and his plea for a more ade
quate provision for these heroes of
the cross after their days of useful
ness in the active service of the
church was such as one only could
give who spoke from experience. Next
Sabbath morning the subject of the
morning sermon will be "True Pre
paradness." In the evening it will be
"Tbe Way of Exaltation." We were
pleased to see such a large attend
ance of the country people last Sun
day. Sabbath School had a nice in
crease last Sunday but the 300 hun
