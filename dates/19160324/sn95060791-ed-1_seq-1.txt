Politicians in Tucson
There was a big stand
gubernatorial timber in Tucson
this week. The Masonic con
clave was responsible for the
gathering of the embryo-statesmen
whose friends are urging
them to the sacrifice. The Demo
cracy was represented by the
Honorable George Olney of Phoe
nix and Safford, who has set
about the task of breaking up the
Hunt machine. While there was
a sinlge representative of Qns
cracy, there was no detrth of
Republican candidates. First to
appear upon the scene was Hon
orable Harry Heap of Prescott
whose boom was launched the
other day. While Mr. Heap
would like to get the nomination
for governor he would accept the
portfolio of treasurer of Yavapai
county. Then came the Honor
able Henry Morgan, not an avow
ed candidate but frequently men
tioned for the nomination. Mr.
Morgan is from Willcox in "dear
old Cochise" which boasts of a
Democratic majority of 1500
which Mr. Morgan is expected
to turn to a Republican majority.
And last but not least, came Tom
Campbell out of the sage brush
at Las Guijas. When Mr. Camp
bell strode into the Santa Rita
hotel lobby, the other aspirants
had to run for cover. When it
came to the glad hand stunt he
simply put Henry Ashurst in the
"down and out club." If the
ability to get votes counts. Mr.
Campbell will be the Republican
nominee and Governor Hunt will
have the fight in November.
A movement for E. S. Clark
for Republican nomination for
governor has been launched in
Phoenix. Mr. Clark who is a
Prescott lawyer, was a delegate
to the Progressive National con
vention but is now said to be
back in the Republican fold. In
the prohibition campaign he was
one of the leading dry speakers.
Mr. Clark was attorney general
during the Kibbey administra
tion. Tucson Citizen, Mar. 18.
