Washington. March 24. Sen
ator J. Hamilton Lewis, Demo
crat, declared in a resolution in- j
troduced today that American
authorities had knowledge of
supplies and money being fur
nished toVilla from foreign coun
tries and from the United States.
His resolution proposed to brand
Americans who give such aid as
guilty of actual treason. The
measure sprung a marked sensa
tion in the senate.
At the request of Senator Borah.
Republican, the resolution was read
twice and then Senator Lewis asked
that it tie over and gave notice that he j
would speak upon it at an early op- j
portunity-
Some of the border senators read
telegram from Citizens expressing j
apprehension for the safety of Ameri
can interests along the Mexican line
and Senator Stone renewed his appeal
to senators not to agitate the situation.
The discussion died without action,
but not until Senator Stone, in making
his plea for no agitation had reiterated
the peaceful intentions of the admin
istration toward the 'arranza govern
ment. Outside Influence Busy.
"An effort is being made by num
erous people in Mexico and numerous
sinister influences in Mexico and I am
sorry to say outside of Mexico." said
he, "to excite the people of thai un
fortunate eonntry, to mislead them
and to impress them with the idea
that the I'nited States is contemplating
an aggression against the whole people
to their great injury.
"The president has given out by

infantry fighting in the Verdun region
of France continues, the artillery,
however, keeping up its active work.
The French guns have been ener
getically cannonading the German po
sitions in the Ma lan court Wood, on
the edge of the Argonne, northwest of
Verdun. The intention apparently is
to break up an anticipated attempt of
the Germans to debouch from this
cover and make further efforts to ad
vance southward toward the mam line
of the Paris-Verdun railroad some 44
miles distant.
ESaat of the Mouse the German bom

Perlin. March 24. The importance
of the struggle around Verdun nat
urally overshadowed interest in the
contest on the eastern front, but th'
latest dispatches show that hard
fighting is in progress in the north
ern sector of the Russian line. The
Russian fire became intense on th'
evening of March 19. More than 50.
000 shells, chiefly heavy caliber, fell
over a small section of the front near
Postavy. German wire entanglements
and the front line trenches were -am-aged
by this fire.
At night the Russians attacked in
thick waves. The first two waves
were mowed down before they reached
the entanglements. The third attack
pierced the German position on a
front of less than 100 yards and as
sailants were ejected by a cotinter
attack led in person by a regimental
commander. At dawn the Russians
made a fourth attack but It was
smothered in the initial stages by Ger
man artillery.
Mowed Down Slavs.
Four Russian divisions are said to
have participated in these move
ments. The Germans were compelled
to summon almost no reserves. Their
lossee; were heavier than on the two
preeeding days of the fighting on ac
count of the Russian rire. but it is as
serted that nevertheless they were
surprisingly small.
Activity of the Russians at other
points ot Field Marshal von Tlinden
burg's front is less marked. Com
parative quiet prevailed on March 19
along the sector between Wisseniew
and N'aro z lakes, except for a strong
night attack of the Russians, which
was repulsed.
The losses sustained by the Rus
sians in these encounters are saia to
have been very heavy. Notwith
standing he severity of the actions,
no concern is evident here. The state
of public teeling was expressed by a
correspon ent. who said:
"The people have no anxiety, be
cause they know Hindenburg is there."
MILITIA NOT NEEDED
Cabinet Discusses Calling Out state
Guards, Deciding Not To.
Washington, March 24. The ques
tion of calling the National Guard for
border duty to release regulars for
service in Mexico was discussed at to
day's cabinet meeting, but it was de
cided there was no prospect of such
action at this time.
The cabinet was told that there was
sentiment in congress to protect the
constantly lengthening line of com
munications of the American punitive
expedition by sending more regulars
into Mexico and placing guardsmen
along the border.
Major General Funston. however,
had not asked for additional troops
today, it was said, and war depart
ment officials did not believe any
mobilization of state troops was nec
essary. After the cabinet meeting officials
said they feared a mobilization of
guardsmen would have a disquieting
effect in Mexico. They expressed con
fidence that American troops in Mex
ico were in no danger. Should large
bodies of ('arranza troops go over to
Villa, however, the question of call
ing out the guard will be considered.

charge today. District Attorney Swann
announced that he had obtained a

quantity of arsenic on March 9. three
days before Peck's death.
Waite S denial was made to George

ney, who examined him at his apart
ment in Riverside drive. Waite still
was in bed recovering from the effects
of strong drugs which he took yes
terday. Put Medicine in Soup.
Waite admitted, according to Mr.
Brothers, that he had put something
into Peck's soup some time prior to
his death, but declared it was medicine
and that Dr. A. A. Moore, the physi
cian who attended Peck during his
illness, had instructed him to employ
this method of giving the patient
medicine because Peck had com
plained that it was bitter and had
refused to take it.
Mr. Brothers announced that Waite
would be removed to Belle vue hos
pital, a prisoner, later in the day. Dr.
Waite today told his guards, according
to reports they made to the district
attorney that he would keep his lips
sealed as to the identity of the woman
with whom he lived at a hotel as Dr.

Attorney Swann said he would ar

was built. The promoters sold the
bonds and the purchasers never
have been reimbursed by the

Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lays down his life for his
friends. John 15-13.
Clarence F. Fields, 50 ft East Fourth
street. Topeka. is the living example
of brotherly love. Fields wants- to go
to prison for a friend. In fact. Fields
today upset all modern ideas of Bib
lical teachings of love and established
a new Damon and Pythias record
when he wrote a letter to Governor
Capper asking that he be permitted to
serve the prison sentence of Arthur
Davenport.
In a recent probe of the state hos
pital scandal, Davenport was the one
man whom the jury found guilty.
Davenport had displayed rare indis
cretion in writing letters to a negro
girl. So the former hospital attendant
was convicted on a charge of criminal
assault. He was recently taken to the
state reformatory at Hutchinson to
serve an indeterminate sentence.
Back to His Wife.
While her husband is in prison. Mr?,
Davenport ha found a home in the
Fields family. Friendship for Daven
port first went out to the unfortunate
wi fe of the convicted man. Now,
Fields believes, there is a far greater
service he may render. He would
leave his own home and go behind
prison walls that Davenport might re
turn to his own fireside. Fields would
quit his work in the Santa Fe fhops
and would kiss his own wife goodbye
and go to Hutchinson for a prison
term that his friend might he free.
Weeping Her Eyes Out.
"His wife is staying with us and is
weeping her eyes out, Fields wrote to
Governor Capper today in an appeal
that he might take the convicted
man's place behind prison walls.
"Grief is killing her. Won't you let
me take his place ?"
Fields didn't write with the pen of
Dante when he addressed his letter to
the governor. He used a lead pencil
and he spelled badly. Fields forgot all
about the rules of punctuation and
capitalization as he yearned for a
chance to help his friend. Over two
pages of cheap scratch paper Fields
scribbled and scrawled his plea to the
state executive.
No one but Fields, perhaps, will ever
know the number of sheets of paper
that were wasted in that labored com
munication to the governor. No one
but Fields knows of the sweat beads
that gathered on his forehood as he
looked over a limited vocabulary and
vainly hunted for words that would
make his appeal most effective and
emphatic. In his labored effort to win
an audience. Fields became eloquent
in his mangling of the English lan
guage. Just Kits and Sobs.
"She just sits and sobs her eyes and
heart out," Fields wrote of Mrs. Da
venport. "Won't you send him home
and let me go in his place?"
Fields is employed in the Santa Fe
shops. He has a wife of his own
and now as a friend he has under
taken to provide a home for Daven
port's wife until the convicted man
wins his liberty. But Fields is willing
to give up his own home, his job. his
freedom and lose his identity in a con
vict's garb and prison number if the
governor willl send his friend home to
his family.
There is no statutory provision that
will enable Fields to become a Kansas
Damon and Davenport must bear his
burdens alone.

Washburn College Will Hot Ac

Rah-Rah's Enlistment Won't
Entitle Him to a Degree.
The fact that students who enlist in
time of war are not granted a diploma
unconditionally, has caused great dis
appointment among several students
who had made up their minds to se-
; cure a short and easy cut to a degree
i bv enlisting for service in Mexico.
Last week a rumor was started to
i the effect that in time of wax it was
I customary to give diplomas to high
school or college students who enlist.
(Four years in Mexico as opposed to
two or three years strife with Latin
J or mathematics seemed the lesser of
j the two evils and a good sized war
j spirit was in a fair way to be started
among Topeka students.
While authorities of Washburn and
the high school expressed themselves
as being perfectly willing that their
! scholars should fight for their coun
j try", they couldn't see their way clear
i to giving a certificate of education for
willingness to tote a gun or a knap-
sack or doing "fatigue" duty.
