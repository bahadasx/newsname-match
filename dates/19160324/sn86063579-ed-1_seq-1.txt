Xo wounded had arrived yester
day nt the base hospital, which
makes il certain that there has been,
no fighting up to this time. The
hospital service has lieen organized
to take eare of a large number of
wounded and the arrival of theui will .
tell the story of the first collision
with the Villa bandits. '
The scenes at the base tell in part
of the lengthening lines of communi

three linen south of Casus (Irnndes.
Motor trains loaded with provision
and equipment depart under eonvo,,
It is evident that there is a consid
erable roop movement since the

allowed no defiuite information to
go out concerning it. Detachment
that have been guarding towns along
the border have been withdrawn.
Two companies stationed at Dcm

early Sunday morning.

of the expeditionary force might lie

Per-liing, and where the heads cf

a matter of conjecture. Villa, baa

it in ', not thought likely that the

have been rtportcd as having gone
