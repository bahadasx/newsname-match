Willard and Moran Confident of
Winning By K.O. Route .
SEATING .CAPACITY SOLD OUT
Prediction That Attendance Will Be
On of the Largeat In History of
Pugilism. (
New York, March 24, The Jaat ar
rangements lor the boxing . bout , ,be
tween the heavywcgbts, Jess WUl&rd.
the present champion, and . Frank
Moran have been completed . and both
boxers have concluded their traiuuife
Both are reported to be in ; the ..best
possible shape for the meeting and re
ports from the training Quarters indi
cate that both men have worked con
scientiously. . v ,
Moran'B line physical condition has
Imbued him with supreme confluence.
In fact, the blonde Plttsburger seemb
over-conlident. Moran is bo sure 01
winning that he expects to land a
knockout. Moran believes that all
that Willard has is size. He has great
confidence in his own ability to take
punishment, and he is certain that the
champion cannot withstand his hard
est punches.
Moran Is glad that his training is
over. He is impatient to do battle
with the big champion. "The whole
thing is getting on my nerves," salu
Moran yesterday, "especially the . at
tention and admiration of the people
who come in to see me work. They
alf want to shake me by the band anu
ask me how 1 feel. Most of them tell
me that all their friends are praying
lor me to win and then they give my
right hand another hard squeeze. U
bakes my hand tired and cramped be
fore I even start to box."
Willard finished his last hard work
out Wednesday and he appeared to
take it . seriously. His trainers are
Just as confident as the , assistants in
the Moran" cainp and they declare
that the bout will not ' go over hah
the ten-round distance before the
,champlonrscore &) knockout. Willaru
should go' into the ring weighing 250
pounds, having taken off about ' 12
poundB since be began training. .
With more than 85 per cent of the
11,000 and odd tickets sold, it is be
coming more evident every hour that
the contest will be witnessed by the
most representative assemblage oi
boxing enthusiasts that ever gathered
about a squared circle in this coun
try. Owing to the high price of seats,
attendance at the bout is beyond the
financial reach of the average follow
ers of the glove game. Their places
lhave been taken, however, by sport
adherents who seldom attend boxing
bouts except those between top-notch-ers
in fistlana.
This contingent Has been ' augment
ed by another group, which, attracted
by the glamor of the contest, is tak
ing its tirst plunge into the fight game.
In the two classes are to be found
bankers, lawyers, prominent railroad
officials, physicians and many other
-business and professional men who do
pot, as a rule, ' iiay much if any at
tention to boxing In New York city.
In 'addition, there wili be the usual at
tendance from the leading- country
and city clubs, the artist and" Bohem
ian clans. .. r "' i
t Not all the advance sale of the high
priced boxes and reserved seats ' has
seen made to New York patrons of
this type, however, for fully 40 pei
ent of it has been to out-of-town ap:
plicants. Some of the leading ' clubs
ipf the South and New England have
ipaid for large . blocks of seats and
$oxes. Reservations on incoming
trains from these sections and from
the middle West are reported to be
well bought Up' by prospective specta
tors who are planning to arrive at
New York either tonight or Saturday
morning.
In less than an hour after the gal
lery tickets were put on sale at the
Madison Square "' garden yesterday
every one was disposed of and hun
dreds of would-be buyers were turned
away. There were many disgruntled
and disappointed men in line who
could not reach the window before the
sale was over and some of them com
plained that the speculators had been
favored. . The show corporation,
which is conducting the bout, an
nounced that tiny intimation of
favoritism in the sale of tickets was
preposterous. The management had
NIGH
made every effort to prevent specu
lators from obtaining a large number
of tickets, it was said, by refusing to
sell more than two to any one person.
Some doubt appears to exist in the
camps of both Willard and Moran re
garding the rules under which the
bouf will be fought. There has been
considerable talk about hitting in the
clinches and in the breakaway. A
study of the contracts which the prin
cipals signed with Promoter Rlckard
shows clearly, however, that the bout
is to be conducted under the rules
and regulations of the New-York state
athletic commission. This code dif
fers, widely from the marquis of
ijueensberry rules, which are the
. standard of both boxing and prize
' fighting tha world around. The
Queensberry rules do not restrain a
i'i .
- t
f-v-. ;
I boxer from punching an opponent at
-iy time during a clinch, and it is
"ijtood that the principals must
v Atto:UemseIves at all times both
in cs. -od in the breakaways.
The fit the New York state
athletic commission, on the other
hand, distinctly provide that there
shall be no bitting in the breaks. The
regulations covering these points are
as follows: "The kidney punch or
blow shall be forbidden in all con
tests. The back-hand punch or blow
is also forbidden. The contestants
shall break clean and shall not strike
a blow while breaking from clinches.
Contestants must not hold and ' bit.
Butting with the head or shoulders,
wrestling or clinching, or illegal use
of elbows, shall not be allowed. There
shall be on unsportsmanlike conduct
on the part of the contestants. This
shall include the use of abusive or in
sulting language."
The commission has announced that
these rules must be strictly observed
and that the referee, "Charles" White
will be instructed to see that they are
obeyed. White has not yet conferred
with cither of the principals, and is
not likely to see them until he enters
Uie rhig to officiate. There is consid
erable, difference of opinion as to
which of the two heavyweights will
bo the . more handicapped by the ob
servance of these rules.- Each can hit
hard and quickly if given an openlnir,
either In a clinch or on the break
away. ;,. CURFEW WILL RING AT 9.15.
Children Will Have 15 Minutes to Va
cate the Streets.
At the informal meeting of the vil
lage trustees Thursday evening it was
decided that the fire alarm bell in the
steeple of the Second Congregational
church should be usod to carry out the
provisions of the curfew ordinance
adopted at the recent village meeting
It was thought best that the bell
should be rung at 9.15 which would
give the children 15 minutes warning
)f the approach of the curfew limit,
9.30.
The signal will be six strokes of the
belL The warning will be sounded
from a fire alarm box by Chief of Po
lice Brazil who will be provided with
a. set of keys so that he may use any
jox. It was taken for granted that
che chief, who is on duty every L even
ing, would be in the vicinity of soma
box at the specified hour.
After ringing the curfew the chief
will adjust the indicators in the Stark
ad the Putnam hose houses. The in
dicator at the central fire station on
Safford street will be 'adjused by
William-Ryan, . the driver of the vil
lage team.
It was practically decided by the
trustees that the testing of the fire
alarm system at 12.05 each day should
hereafter be omitted and that the cur
few should take the place of the test
Since the meeting of the ' trustees,
William H. Nichols, the -electrician
who has charge of the Bystem, has sug
jested that the noon testing should be
letaineil and such a course may
eventually be adopted. '
The plans made by the trustees Fri
day evening were not final and there
may.be changes In the arrangements
in the future, if a trial shows that dif
ferent methods are desirable.

alized American citizen has returned
to Stuttgart, and In an interview, as
given out by the Overseas News Agen

that a submarine sank the Dutch
steamship Tubantia, on which he;was
a passenger. He declared it was im
possible that the Tubantia could have
been torpedoed by mistake, inasmuch
as she was marked with electric signs
giving her name and nationality. "Oi

from what he was able to observe, that

TIRED WORKING MEN
A Local Druggist Suggests a Remedy
For Overworked, Run-down
Men.
The following letter from Manager
Hocles recounts the experience and
condition of many Bennington men.
Read this letter and our offer which
follows:
Brooklyn, N. Y. "I am a general
office manager, and became so ner
vous and run-down In health that I
lost my appetite and finally my health
broke down completely, largely be
cause of overwork, I tried Beef Iron
and Wine, and other remedies with
out help. I saw Vinol advertised, and
soon after taking it I noticed an Im
provement. I now have a hearty
appetite, sleep better, feel better and
have gained considerable In weight."
Samuel Hodes, 501 Stone Ave.,
The reason Vinol is so successful
In such cases is because it contains
the three oldest and most famous
tonics viz. the medicinal elements of
fresh cod livers without oil, peptonate
of iron and beef peptone. ,
We ask every run-down, over worked
man in Bennington to try a bottle of
Vinol with the understanding that
their money will be returned if it fails
to help as it did Mr. Hodes. Wm. L.

INFANTRY HAS DAY OF REST
Germans and French Have Both In

. " ' :'.'!
London.. March 23. Except on the
fronfnea'r Gpmmecourt and the Beth-uue-LBassea
road, where the British
gained; some advantages . In fights'
agaljiet the Germans, no' Infantry en
gagements have taken place along the
line tln .France and Belgium.' Heavy
fighting however, continues between
the Germans and Russians on the east
ern front from the region of Riga
southward.
'J lie Vjisi mans northwest of Verdun
are keeping up their violent shelling
of the Malancourt sector and have
again trained their guns on the French
front of Bethlncourt, Le Mort Homme
and Cuniieres.
The French have not slackened their
bombardment ot the Malancourt wood
from positions In the Argonne forest,
and are also shelling heavily German
positions and the roads and railways
held by the Germans in the eastern
part of the Argoune.
The bombardment to the northeast
of Verdun, as well as in the Woevre
region, to the east of the fortress, has
increased Intensity.
Berlin, March 23, (by Wirless to
Sayville.) The Lokal-Anzeiger says
that -because of the progress made by
German troops near Avocourt yester
day the French line between Bethin-
court and-Malancourt is now menaced.
It asserts-that the French positions
are threatened from the east by tho
German successes near Dead Man's
Hill and from the ,west as a result of
the German victoryof the wooded reg
ion northeast of Avocourt.
. .The newspaper points -out that Avo
court is only seven kilometers from
the Important Verdun-Paris Railroad,
the Intervening distance being covered
with woods and hills. 1 ,
i London, March 24-Heavy masses
of Russians are pressing the Germans
from the Riga district southward for a
distance of seventy iniies.sj While they
have gained some advantages, the Rus
sinn war office admits that south of
Lake Dreswiaty the Germans recap
tured trenches that' tho Russians had
taken the previous night. The Rus
sians have again pierced the opposing
line in the JacobBtat section.
According to the German official
communication "not even the smallest
advantage against the unshaken Ger
man defense," has been obtained any
where in this great offensive the Rus
sians have undertaken in northwest
Russia. While Berlin declares the
Russians have ceased their vicious at
tacks in the neighborhood of Postavy,
Russian officially announces the light
ing there continues, and that south
west of Lake Narecz the Russian
troops have again advanced under a
violent bombardment
" The Austrlans, combatting the Rus
sians in Galicla and the Italians along
the Austro-Italian frontier,' appear to
pa holding their lines, without change.

DENY ATTACKS ARE, FLAGGING
Berlin Military Circles Explain Reason
for Pauses In Battle.
-Berlin, March 22. Attempts in oth
er countries to interpret the pauses in
the German operations at Verdun as
indicative of the waning of the offen
sive or the exhaustion of German
troops denote failure to comprehend
German strategy, according to the
tenor of discussion in military circles
here. Officers say these pauses are
only part of the, general scheme of op
erations, and are designed to prepare
for the successive stages of the for
ward movement. .
The method has been to make prep
aration for every attack so thoroughly
as to guarantee success with minimum
losses. German commanders have
purposely avoided a simultaneous at
tack on the whole Verdun front and
have sought local successes in one sec
tion after another. ,.
Neither do these, officers admit the
Germans are fighting to revive the
spirits of the people at home, with only
a forlorn hope of victory. It is said
that these operations are intended to
lead to the capture of Verdun and has
ten the termination pf the war. . , ;
The comparative slowness of ( the
movements is based -on "deliberate
choice of the best method of . accom
plishing the end sought Reports that
the German losses have been unduly
heavy in view of the results achieved
find no confirmation here. Instead of
sending men Into battle In close for
mation for machine "guns to mow them
down, as is represented in the press
of hostile countries, German com
manders have been sparing of the
lives of their troops. ........
The results of the operations at Ver
dun thus far, in regard both to the
positions gained and the losses sus
tained, have been fully In line with
expectations.
BATTLE FOR RAILROADS.
Russians Started (Offensive When
Hindenburg Made First Move
Petrograd, March ' 23. -Side, by side
with Verdun, two ether names, Vilna
and Vllelka, are now coming into' the
forefront of the war. Hindenburg is
moving again, but so aro Kuropatkin
and Evert..' Hindenburg began feeling
at first on Lake Kanger, near Riga, and
then again, on March 17, at the Tve
rech position, south of Dvlnsk, and the
result has been finally to bring into
motion a menacing Russian offensive.
The Russian' onset-roused the Ger
mans to a strained counter offensive.
The alarm has been given, and now
fierce battles are flaming up on the
line of lakes that stretches south: of
Dvinsk to near Molodechno. They are
battles for the railways. ,' The Germans
are struggling to reach the line, that
runs from Molodechno through Vilelka
to Polotsk, and so open the way to
Misk, or to get in' the rear of the
DvinBk positions.
The railways run - northeastward,
whereas the fighting line, with some. ir
regularities, runs in a southerly direc
tion from Dvinsk. This means that In
the north, just about Lake Dreswaity
and near Videy, the Russians are at
their nearest to the Dvlnsk-Vilna Rail
way, while the nearest point at which
the Germans could strike the Polotsk
Molodechno Railway Is about Vllieka
in the south. But the Russians at pres
ent have the upper hand.. They have
grasped the initiative and their attacks
have been successful.
The Germans are mainly on the de
fensive, fighting stubbornly in the re
gion between the lakes , to hold the
strong positions they so elaborately
constructed during the long Winter,
and are doing their utmost to prevent
that smashing blow which would neut
ralize their operations against Dvinsk
and scatter their dream of advance ou
Petrograd in the spring.
. VILLA HOLDS UP A.TRAIN
Spanish Merchant Says Bandit Had
Force of 1500 Men.
El Paso, March 23.-:-Garcia Flores, a
Spanish merchant of the city of ' Chi
huahua, who arrived hero tonight, said
Villa had held up a train on which he
was traveling at Moctezuma, eighty
five miles northeast from Namiquipa,
where the Carranza authorities have
Insisted the bandit chief was located.
Flores Is well known in El Paso.
"We were traveling north from Chi
huahua City," he said, "and were near
ing Moctezuma, Wednesday afternoon
when we encountered a large force of
men. Accordlug to my best estimate
there must have been 1,500 in alL
"When we reached the station we
were amazed to see Pancho Villa him
self enter the train. We had supposed
he was many miles to the west. . He
walked through every carriage, declar
ing that he was searching for Ameri
cans and that he would ktll any he
found. ,
" 'I am not fighting Mexicans,'. lie an
nounced, 'except the first chief : ;- and
those traitors with him who have
turned Mexico over to the Americans.'
"Villa stopped to chat wjtli ' some
friends of his who were on the train.
He told them that General Herrera had
joined him three days since with 2,000
men, fully ejulpped and armed, .who
had followed him from Chihuahua City
He finally left the train without molest
j lng anyone, but he took Borne supplies
which he said he needed badly.
While doing their Saturday after

should visit the rooms of the Young
Woman's club over the Banner office

AMBASSADOR AYS
HERRERA HAS NOT
Officially Denied That Chihuahua
Garrison Has Revolted
LESS TENSION IN WASHINGTON
Anxiety Somewhat Relieved by Re
storation of Radio Communi
cations with Pershing.''
Washington, March 24. Tension in
administration quarters over the
Mexican situation relaxed yesterday
in the absence of official confirmation
of the report that 2000 Carranza troops
at Chihuahua under Luis Herrera had
Joined Villa. Conflicting unofficial
advices from the border, however,
caused the Btate department to ' tele
graph American consuls at Chihuahua
and Durango for immediate reports
as to the situation in the Torreon
region where Herrera was last report
ed. The accumulation of denials of the
Herrera report during the day; the
safe arrival of the army motor trucks
with the expeditionary forces, the re
storation of radio communication with
Gen. Pershing's forces and the satis
factory progress of diplomatic negoti
ations with the de facto government
served to relieve official anxiety. An
official denial from the Carranza au
thorities at Juarez that Herrera had
revolted was presented to Secretary
Lansing in Person by Elisco Arredondo
embassador designate of the defacto
government Mr. Arredondo. called to
continue the conference with Counse
lor Polk on the proposed protocol
between the two governments covering
the operations of American troops now
in Mexico. The general duline draft
of the document has been agreed to
and reported to Gen Carranza. but de
tails remain to be worked out
