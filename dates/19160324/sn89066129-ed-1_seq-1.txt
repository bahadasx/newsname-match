Electric Light Meeting
The annual meeting of the La
clede Electric Light Company was
held in the directors' room of the
Lomax & Standly Bank last Tues
day afternoon. There were present
Harry and Percy W. Markham and
R. L. Wheeler of Brookfield and
H. C. and H W. Lomax, A. P
Higgins and A. J. Caywood of La
clede, all the stockholder being
present except W. N. Wheeler of
Marceline who was represented by
R. L. Wheeler.
Two blocks of stock has changed
hands since the last meeting, E.
B. Allen selling his five shares to
R. L. Wheeler and Miss Anna
Ransom her five shares to A. P.
Higgins.
After some routine business the
following board of directors were
elected for the ensuing year: Harry
and P. W. Markham, R. L.
Wheeler, A. J. Caywood and A; P.
Higgins.
On adjournment of the stock
holders' meeting the board of di
rectors met and elected the follow
ing officers: A. J, Caywood, presi
dent; A. P. Higgins, vice-presi
dent; H. C. Lomax, treasurer; P.
W. Markam, secretary and mana
ger.
Mr. Higgins, the new member of
the company, has had experience
in electric light business, having!
been a stockholder in the company
at Galesburg, 111., and a stock
holder and promoter in establishing
and managing an electric car line
in Illinois before coming to Laclede
and will no doubt be a valuable
acquisition to the Laclede company.
Laclede is the pioneer small town
to have real electric light service
in this part of the state twenty
four hours service with "juice"
enough for all the lights and power
that might be hooked on. When
the company was organized four
years ago there was some doubt in
the minds of those who put their
money into the venture as to it
being a paying proposition, but
the united effort of all the members
together with the loyal support of
the citizens of the town and the
city administration, it has reached
a sound financial basis and the
stockholders' now feel they are to
receive a fair dividend on the in
vestment, as well as giving the
town one of its most valuable enter
prises.
