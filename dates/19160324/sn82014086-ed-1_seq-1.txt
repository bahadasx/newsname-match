AN EMERGENCY LIGHTING
SYSTEM FOR STEAMSHIPS
Has Been Perfected by the United
States Bureau of Navigation.
Washington. March 23. Perfection
of an emergency lighting system of
steamships was announced today by
the United States bureau of navigation.
The invention Is the work of R. Y.
Cadmus, a radio inspector at Balti
more. It is designed to light vessels
so that no accident can leave a ship in
darkness when passengers are to be
removed.
The system Is operated by the aux
iliary power for the wireless apparatus.
The general lighting plant on a sink
ing ship is submerged soon after the
craft begins to go down, and many
passengers have lost their lives be
cause they were unable to lnd their
way to the decks quickly enough when
a vessel began to sink. The ne. sys
tem is so arranged that although the
lower decks may be submerged the
top decks remain lighted until the ship
disappears.
Should the lights be used for pur
poses other than emergency an auto
matic arrangement cuts off the dis
charge of current at a certain point
and reserves an emergency supply.
