Deny Telegram's Truth.
San Antonio, ToxaB, March 21. Oen-
oral Doll at El I'aso, sent to General
Punston yesterday n mcssaRO saying
that his (Doll's) report of Wednesday
that General Herrera had revolted,
has been confirmed. General Funston
advised tho War Department.
El Paso, Texas, March 24. General
Luis Herrera has revolted from Gen
eral Cnrranza and has declared that
ho will resist with all his power the
entry of American troops into Moxlco,
but Is still opposed to Francisco Villa,
according to reports from sources be
lieved reliable.
Tho news of Herrera disaffection
was considered sufficiently authentic
for Urlgndler General George Doll, Jr.,
to telegraph General Funston at San
Antonio that he bollevcd It to be true.
General Dell added to his message,
however, the emphatic denial of Her
rcra's reported revolt Issued here yes
terday by Mexican Consul Andreas
Garcia which was supported by a mcs
sago which was said to have been re
ceived from General Herrera himself.
General Herrera has been known as
a personal enemy of Villa. Ills pres
ent position Is said to bo that the dc
facto government has betrayed Mexi
can Interests In permitting the soldiers
of the United States to enter Mexican
territory and that this betrayal out
weighed whatever offenses Villa has
committed.
Washington I'uzzled II) Cmillrmiillnn.
Washington, March 24. Tension In
administration quarters over the Mcx
lean situation relaxed yesterday In tho
abscuco of official confirmation of the
report that 2,000 Carranza troops at
Chihuahua under Luis Herrera had
joined Villa. Conflicting unofficial ad
vices from the border, however, caused
the State Department to telegraph Am
crlcan consuls at Chihuahua nml Du
rango for Immediate reports as to tho
situation In tho Torreon region whero
Herrera was last reported. Slow wire
communication south of the border
may delay the replies.
Officials were perplexed by dls
patches from tho border saying Gen
cral Dell had notified General Funston
that the report of Hcrrcra's revolt
was confirmed. When the War Dc
partment closed for tho night nt 11
o'clock Secretary Daker stated that
General Funston had not advised tho
department of General Dell's report.
and that all information reaching him
Indicated that Herrera was loyal to
Carranza. Major General Scott, chief
of staff, declared emphatically ho did
not believe tho report.
Some officials, however, wcro report
ed to believe that Herrera had desert
cd Carranza, though they doubted that
he had joined Villa.
