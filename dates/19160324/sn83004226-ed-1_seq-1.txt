HENRY YOUTSEY'S
EASE TO THE FRONT
DISCUSSION PRECIPITATED BY
STATEMENT OF A PRISON
', COMMISSIONER.
The following statement given1 oul
by tha Chalrmun of the Prison Com
mission hiu stirred up the Henry
Youtsey matter agalni
Frankfort, Ky, Murch 21, Dunlel K.
O'Hulllvan, chiilmuin of the Prison
Commission, gave out the following
statement to-day: . '
"At the next moiling of the Prison
Commission, Tuesday, April 4. I um go
Ing to present the name of Henry
Youtaey for parole;:. I huvo not dis
cussed the matter with my associate
and I do not know what view thuy will
take of It. Hut my duly l clear. The
time haa come when 1 muni vole to
give Youtaey the benefit of the parole
law. Jla la entitled to it by length of
service, by conllnuoua valuable work
for the State, by the provisions of the
law, and by every dlcliit of fairness
and humanity.- He haa served more
titan sixteen yenre for his crime. Dur
ing my term of office we have paroled
X.100 convicts, guilty "of every crime In
the calendar, and at every meeting of
the lTieon Comnilaalon we parole aome
life prlaoner who haa served leaa than
half the time Youtaey has served. The
law under which he was sentenced eu
tltlea him to a parole after five yearn.
He haa nerved more than three' time
five yeara, and for twelve years he has
been eligible.
"I believe In the parole law. It la
Wis and merciful law. It haa done
more to promote diaciplihe In the prls-,
on than all other influencea combined.
It ahould apply to Henry Youtaey aa to
very other convict, white or black.
"Youtsey' crime whk the most
daatardly In the long record that haa
drenched Kentucky in blood. Wbcth.
er he fired the allot that murdered Wm.
Ooebel, or conspired to assassinate him
ha waa equally guilty and ahould have
paid tha extreme penally. Hut the
Jury that tried him gave him a, life
aentence. nd the biw entitle htm to
parole. Youtaey waa a mere boy In
yeara. and tha oowarda who fired hia
wretched brain and sought to profit by
bla act are guiltier than he. They are
all free, eoma driven In disgrace from
their native Stale, othera gaining po
liucal preferment for their slutre In the
murder of Wm. Ooebel. all of them ben
eficiaries of undeserved pardons.
"YouUey alone la tortured on the
rack of a life Imprisonment, t believe
that tha people of Kentucky. Irretnan-t-lve
of party, want" him parolwd. I hon
or Justus floebel for his devotion to
hia brother's memory. His loyalty and
hia eelf-aacrlllca ennoble him. 1 do
not want to own hia wounds afresh,
but under my conscience and my tath
of office I must vote for the parole of
Henry Youtaey."
The newspaper of Louisville and
Lexington at once wired the two oth
er members of the Hoard for a ntnte
ment of their position. Both K. T
Hatches, and M. F. Conley replied that
they would vote against the parole.
In response to a request for a state
ment of hia position In the" matter of
paroling Henry Youtsey. M. F. Conley.
ITIson Coinmlsaloner. nave out the fol
lowing to the newepiipers:
Louisa, Ky, March 2!. "Only n un
usual situation could Induce me to
make a statement about a parolo In ud
var.ee of the Hoard's action.
1 shall vote against the parole of
Henry Youtsey, one of the conspirators
and assassin of Governor Ooebel. at
any time the rase may come before the
Hoard while I am a memlier. I con
alder assassination tho worst of all
crimes. It Is committed In delibera
tion, not In sudden passion. Only a
demon can contemplate and execute
this dastardly crime. The victim ha
no chance to defend himself, to lice for
hia life, to beg for mercy, to iidjust hia
material or spiritual affairs, or to send
a last goodbye to his family. If the law
hna any right to indict the death pen
alty, surely Justice demands Its appli
cation In nil cases of aasassinntlcn.

orlate. If I had a chance. Then why
make nn exception in ms case: imui
of guilt Is the only ground upon which
j would ever vote to parole any assas
sin. There Is none In Youtsey' case.
After having been proven guilty he
confessed. Not before.
I believe In the parolo law, but the
Hoard has wide discretion In Its appli
cation and Is supposed to consider the
degree and circumstances of tho crime.
The assassinntlon of Wm. Ooebel and
the events following It from tho worst
chapter In American titstory. The Slate
was carried to the verge of Civil War.
Youtsey entered I he penitentiary in
February 1901. ' lie was then iT years
old.ta mature manwell educated, the
husbnnd of a good woman. In 1912 ho
broke the prison rules and wna reduc
ed In gnulo, making him Ineligible for
parolo consideration for nine months.
Twice since that tho Warden hna found
.It necessary to report cases of
misconduct against him. Ho has more
deslrablo employment In tho prlaoh
than most other convicts because he is
better fitted by education and exper
ience than almost any other num in
there. Being a good stenographer he
la assigned to ollice work because his
services are worth more to the Htate
there than elsewhere. Un is well treat
ted, aa nearly all convict should be.
Justus (loebel, fighting for till life
dally against disease, a battle, which
began before his eminent brother was
so ruthlessly murdered, deserves more
consideration in this matter at the
hands of the officials of our Htate than
all the aaaasslna in or out of prisons.
If sympathy and sentiment are to play
any part In this case 1 don't see how
It can rest elsewhere than upon this
worthy brother, whose life, already
carrying the burden of III health, has
been wrecked by the awful crime for
which Youtsey lias as yet paid only a
comparatively light penalty. I deem It
proper to state here, however, that no
wrtrd haa come to me from Mr. Ooebel
about this case, nor to the Hoard since
I have been a member, ao for as I now
recall,! He has probably regarded such
action aa unnecessary."
At least one-half of the paroles this
Hoard hoa granted were the result of a
Court of Appeals decision, which left
us no discretion. These were convic
tion under the 1910 law.
Fate of -Assassins in Lawrence.
About thirty year ago an assassi
nation occurred in Lawrence county.
The victim was a poor man. Con
viction on circumstantial evidence was
made In the court, the aentence of death
was lrniMscd and later indicted by
hanging, which, was then the legal
method used. The assassin's accom
plice was given a'sentence of life Im
prlHonmenl and died ill the )enlten
tlary. ' We do not recoil another as
ansei nation In. Uwrnnrn county since
tiuit. Certainly adequate punishment
has a wholesome restraining Influence
ui"i men mean enough to commit as
sHSHltlation. Gov. 8tanley en Youtsey Cat.
The Lexington leader says:
Coventor rllanley this afternoon, was
asked what his views were regarding
the purole of Youtsey. "That is a mat

PUBLIC SPIRITED
CITIZEN DRAGS ROAD
DAVID ELSWICK SETS LAUDABLE
EXAMPLE IN LAWRENCE
COUNTY.
We are glad to hir of the work of
one enterprising citizen of Ijiwrence
county In a direction that would solve
the bad roads problem If all others
would follow his example.
iMtvtd Klswlck, living on Kast Fork,
was out Tuesday with an improved
road drag, putting the road alongside
his farm into good condition. The rains
had put this road Into the same mud
dy, sloppy condition as all others li
this county. His dug was chasing the
water off of the road, smoothing the
surface, and putting a crown on the
road so that the next ruin that falls
will run off. The parties from Istulsa
who drove along there Bay the differ
enre between that piece of road and all
others they saw was wonderful.
The success of the road drag used aa
directed by the U. 8. department of
good roads. Is being demonstrated in
many places. In a few counties the
farmers have taken up the mntter and
are not depending upon the officials to
build and maintain roads. They are
working in harmony and every farm
er Is dragging the roads adjacent to
hia farm. Any county will furnish the
drngs on such an arrangement as this
A few daya work in this way In each
year with a drug, used at the right
time, would glvo Uiwrence county bet
ter roods than four times tho presont
amount . of revenue can produce.
Here is a great opportunity for aome
of our enterprising citizens,, with the
nld of the county farm agent, to or
ganize a movement of this kind,
MENTALLY UNBALANCED.

Hotel Frederick, the board of trustees
of Morris Harvey College elected Hev.
V. V, W. Darlington, of this city, pres
ident of Morris Harvey to succeed I'aul
II. Willis, who was not an applicnnt for
re-election. This la an announcement
which will create a degree of surprise
which will amount to a sensation in
the bounds of the Western Virginia
Conference of the Methodist Kplanopal
Church, Houth, In which there is
scarcely any other ' clergyman so well
known as ,Lr. Parllngton. The new
president haa for the last three years
devoted his energies to the upbuildln?
of Morris Harvey College, the offliial
educational institution of the Confer
ence. Whep he concluded a pastorate
of four' years at '. Johnson ; Mcmorinl
Church he accepted the post of Confer
ence Secretary of Kducation. He held
this post a year and the second year
performed the duties In connection
with those of presiding elder of Ash
land district. Ituring the present year
his attention Is being engrossed by the
duties of the secretaryship. During
these years he has done substantial
work toward the creation of a $100,0110
endowment fMiid for Morris Harvey,
while this year, through a campaign
for one dollar subscriptions la.' has
practically UTted the floating debt of
the Institution..
Morris Harvey College Is located at
riarboursvllle, the former county seat.

Some regret was expressed that the
step meant the retirement of Dr. Darl-
Ingion from the ministry but It was
pointed out that many of the great
leaders of (tout hern Methodism have
cvme up through the Church schools.
It was slated when the announce
ment of the election of DrrDorluigton
was made that this would not mean
tiny change in the policy of the school.

After I'arkorsburg he came to Hunt
ington to be pastor of Johnson Memo

tion of his leadership that the church
erected its present magnificent edi
fice., No pastor who has served in
Huntington haa been more deeply loved
by his own people than was he few
if any have achieved such popularity
without the bounds of his denomina

reds of people. No selection which
could have been made In the matter of
the presidency of Morris. Harvey could
have been more popular than this bids
fair to prove.
Dr. Darlington was given his degree,
Doctor of Divinity, by his alma mater,

MORE NITROGLYCERINE
STORED NEAR LOUISA.
The Marietta Torpedo company has
oaln deposited a considerable quan
tity of nitroglycerine near the spot of
the recent explosion, two'mlles west of

order to warm persons who may happen
along and not know of the danger. It
Is too near ,a public road. What was
called a magazine before wns nothing

RESTRICTING LAW TO

NEW DISTRICT DECLARED TO
BE PROHIBITED BY CONSTITUTION.
Frankfort, Ky, March 22. -Opponents
of the new Thirty-sixth judicial
district, which takes Wolfe out of the
Twenty-third, Morgan out of the Thirty-second,
and Magoflin out of the
Thirty-first, probably will Institute
proceedings as soon as the bill becomes
a law to establish what they consider
its unconstitutionality.
Section 128 of the Constitution says
on this subject: "The number of said
districta, excluding those In counties
having a population of 160, shall not
exceed one district for each 60,000 of
the population of the entire State."
Outside of Jefferson codnty there are
2,026,8X5 people in Kentuoky and divid
ing It by 60,000 allows thirty-three and
a sufficiently large fraction for thirty
four judicial districts outside Jefferson
