San Antonio, Tex., March 23. 'Gen

Carrnnzlsla troops at Chihuahua City,
Ib reported from reliable Bournes to
feavo revolted with his men. declared
hla Intention of Joining Villa and to
have declared war on tho lUnlted
etates.
Washington, March 23. Official
confirmation was received at tho war
department of the defection'of ex-Gov-crnor
ITerrera of Chihuahua, with
1,000 trooiw, to the cause of General
Villa. It camp In dispatches received i
from General Funston and General
Bell.
The news caused grave npprehen
, ion iu official circles. Fear is ex
pressed that the action of Herrera,
who was formerly on Villa's staff of
Ccnerals. may be followed by defec
tion on the part of other Villa sym
pathizers;. Following a conference "with tho
twesldeut n't tho White House, Secre
tary of War Baker confirmed the re
ports that came from the border that
Horrera had deserted Carranza to
take up common cause -with Villa.
Secretary Baker stated that in a
Clspatch received at the department
General Funston denied a border re
port that twenty-seven army trucks,
with their drivers missing, had been
found miles off the line of march in
Mexico. Tho secretary also 'declared
tfmt no further troop movements are
to contemplation at present.,
Prior lo Secretary Baiter's stnte-
GUARDING THE BORDER
went army officers had expressed con
cern over the situation likely to de
velop as a result of Herrera's espousal
at Villa's cause, and there were Inti
mations that prompt stops would now
have to be taken to protect General
Pershing's lines of communication. It
la regarded as probable that orders
may soon bo issued directing troopi
stationed at difforent points through
out tho country to hold themselves in
readiness for a movement toward the
border.
Available Forces.
At tho present tlrao there are avail
able, exclusive of Held artillery and
engineers, Just 6,105 troops of the mo
MIo force of the United Statos army
in this country that are not now on
tho border. Officials of tho war de
partment added that, if necessary the
14.000 coast artillery troops in the
United States could bo drawn on,
making a total additional regular
ermy forco of 22,212. It is also sug
EOBtod as probable that tho war do-

Conditions in tho Tampico oil dis
trict, on the east coast, were admitted
by the stato department to bo bad,
end thouph no confirmation was found
in official dispatches, officials of tho
department were inclined to credit
tho press reports from Torreon that
the British consul thero has decided
to send all foreign women nnd chil
dren from that city to the American
border in boxcars. The situation In
the Tampico district caused Secretary
of the Navy Daniels to announce thnt
he had ordered the battleship Ken

Washington, March 23. Disquieting

been more or less a stamping ground
of tho outlaw' elements In Mexico,

that point. The battleship Kentucky
of the Atlantic reserve fleot will,
therefore not stop nt Galveston aB

about ten miles outside of Tampico.
She is commanded by Commander

to tho effect that Felix Diaz, at the
head of an army of 5,000 mon, has oc
cupied tho important Mexican city of
Pueblo, which is located about half

The last reports of the Diaz move
ment was to the effect that his army

ONE STILL MISSING
Lost American Aviator Found by
Scouts Near Casas Grandes.
Columbus, N. M., March 23. Robert
-B. Willis, one of the lost American
aviators, has been found by scouts
sont out from Casas Grandes to locate
him. According to announcement
Lieutenant Ed?ar S. Carroll, the other
missing aviator, has not been found.
It Is admitted that the aeroplanes are
not as satisfactory as tho government
expected, duo largely to tho fact that
the engines are not powerful or fast
enought for the high .altitude of the
Slorra Madro.
As tho aviators carried but little
food or water when thoy left hero It
is feared that Lieutenant Corroll, If
forced to descend any distance from
habitations, may starve or die of
thL-st before he is rescued.
