WILL BENEFIT
MANY SETTLERS
New Bill Introduced to Aid the
Homesteaders.
AFFECTS THIS DISTRICT
Hardship Worked on Many Home
steaders Will be Overcome by
Bill—May Pass Senate. •
A bill, that will be 6f benefit to
many settlers upon the public domain
has been introduced by Senator My
ers of Montana in the United States
senate.
For sometime past many applica
tions for final naturalization papers
were turned down by the immigration
officers for the reason that the ap
plicants had declared their intention
of becoming citizens of the United
States, or in other words, had taken
out their first citizenship papers in a
judicial district other than the one
in which they resided.
For instance, many homeseekers
filed on land in a different land dis
trict than the one ' where their land
is at the present time, and naturally
when filing took out their first pa
pers there. In many cases this was
in a different judicial district than
the district where their homesteads
were located, which thus invalidated
their declarations, and when these
same persons applied for final natur
alization papers they were turned
down and again required to declare
their intention anew, thus precluding
many from making final proof upon
their homesteads for another two
years.
Judge John W. Tattan some time
ago called the attention of Senator
Myers of this fact.
The bill introduced Toy Myers has
the effect of validating all such dec
larations made in the counties of Cas
cade, Chouteau, Teton, Hill, Blaine
and Valley. This bill is especially in
teresting to this community, as there
are many homesteaders affected
thereby. If this bill ife enacted into
law, those who took out their first
papers in any other judicial district
than the seventeenth, or old twelfth,
but in the above named bounties, will
have the right to apply for their final
papers if the naturalization laws
have been complied with, and the said
declarations of intention will have
the same force and effect as though
in the judicial district in which the
applicant resided or had his home
stead.
There have been many cases come
up within this district where hard
ship has been worked on many de
serving homesteaders, who through
an unintentional mistake have been
unable to prove up on- their home
steads, and if the above bill goes
through it will prove a boon to many.
WILL BETTER MAIN LINE.
In connection with the pilans of the
Great Northern Railway company for
the improvement of its line on the
western slope of the Rockies, con
sisting of the elimination or reduc
tion of curvatures and the double
tracking of the road, work is just be
ing commenced by the contractors up
on another mile of betterments ex
tending west from that strip near
Paola which was improved last year.
The contract is in the hands of A.
Guthrie and Co. of St. Paul, which
concern handled the Paola tunnel and
line work last year and whose plant
and camp equipment was allowed to
remain standing following the com
pletion of last year's work. The com
pany's foremen are now on the ground
organizing forces and construction
will be in full blast shortly.
This year's work, which will reduce
most of the curvature and which will
eliminate a couple of 10-degree curves
will include the construction of a tun
nel 600 feet in length. This will be
cut through the mountain with suf
ficient width to accommodate two
tracks, although only one will be
maintained for a time until the gen
eral scheme of double tracking is car
ried out. The tunnel will take the
place of a smaller single track tunnel
350 feet in length and which was dug
with a curvature of 10 degrees. The
new tunnel will be bored further back
in the hill and will reduce the curve
to a minimum.
The rest of the work will consist
of some ourve reductions and the con
struction of a grade wide enough to
carry two tracks. None of this strip
will be double tracked at the present
time but it is a part of the scheme
for the ultimate double tracking
the line all the way from Summit
down to Columbia Falls.
At the present time that 10-mile
stretch of the road between Summit
and Java is double tracked, the work
having been done several years ago.
Last year the grade and tunnels for a
mile west of Paola were prepared for
double tracking and this year's work
will extend that strip about one mile
further, practically finishing the work
between Paola and Garry. This
leaves another 10-mile stretch in be
tween the two pieces to be improved
later.
Resident Engineer P. S. Hervin, un
der whose direction this work is to be
carried out, anticipates that the one
mile stretch to be improved this year
will be completed by December 1.
Northern,
WORKING FOR A
GRADE CROSSING
Matter Will be Taken Up With Great
Northern Officials.
Concerted action on the part of the
committees who have been circulat
ing petitions the past week, asking
the Great Northern for a grade cross
ing, has accomplished the desired re
sults, and the delegates to represent
the various interests of the city will
leave on the first of the week to take
the matter up with President L. W.
Hill and the officers of the Great
^
The fact that the Great Northern
is to do a great deal of improvement,
work here the coming summer, there- j
by bringing to the city much addi- j
tional equipment for the work and
having a large crew of laborers here,
will greatly minimize the cost of put
ting in the grade crossing.
The city is entering upon an era
of unprecedented development and if
the crossing is put in this year, it will
mean a great saving to the railroad
company, as the crossing will become
an absolute necessity within the next
few years, and the longer it is delay
ed, the more difficult it will be to put
through.
There is no getting away from the
many convincing arguments that the
city representatives will propound to
the Great Northern officials, and the
many benefits that both the citizens
and the railroad company will derive
from a crossing.
Dr. M. D. Hoyt will represent the
citizens of Glasgow as a delegate,
Alderman W. W. Hurd the city coun
cil and R. M. Lewis, the Commercial
club, in presenting the petitions to
the Great Northern officials and ex
plaining the situation to them.
be
$1,000,000 FOR CUT-OFF.
Approximately $1,000,000 will
spent by the Great Northern railway
this year on its New Rockford-Lew
istown cut-off across North Dakota
and Montana. This is the biggest
link in a second transcontinental _ line
for the Great Northern, and it iS
possible, if conditions remain good.j
the improvement program may be ex
tended further.
In North Dakota the gap in the!
new cut-off extends from New Rock
ford to Arnegard, whence the line
runs West to Newton, Mont. Here
there is another gap extending toj
Lewistown. According to plans, work.
will be started on a line east from
Arnegard and west from Newton
along a route already surveyed. Be-j
tween twenty-five and thirty miles of
new track are included in the pro-,
gram.
Official announcement of the pre
cise mileage and the places where
work will be done will be deferred
until the return from California of
President Louis W. Hill.

RIVER NEARING
FLOOD STAGE
High Waters Now Cover Low
Places m Valley.
DANGER LESSENED HERE
Freeze Last Night of Great Benefit—
Cherry Creek Still Within Its
Banks—May Build Dike. »
With the steady rise of the waters
of the Milk River and the tributary
creeks during the past week, Glas
gow has been in danger of experienc
ing one of the worst floods in its
history.
The warm weather and daily rainfalj
has caused the river to run bank full
and Thursday night it was over 26
feet above normal. It has stilLa few
feet to go before it will reach the out
skirts of the residence district, but
if it continues to rise at the rate it
has the last few days, the flood can
not be averted.
Not much danger is looked for from
the south or east sides of the city, but
Cherry creek is the chief cause of
worry of those in the flood district.
This creek has not been running much
water, but the warm weather has
started it and with the back water
from the Milk River, it is liable to
overflow its banks, and if this occurs,
a flood may be expected .
Thursday aft ernoon Cherrv creek
j had geveral feet tQ gQ before " it would
j above itg bankg and there has
been some talk of building a dike to
prevent any of the overflow . from
reaching the city.
Shortly after sundown last (Thuis
day) night, the sleet which had been
,, , . . . ..
falling all day turned into fine snow
and a general freeze-up resulted'
which will greatly lessen the dan
ger of a flood for a few days at least.
Water has filled f hc slough in the
south part of town but it has still
three or four feet to gi before it rea
ches the furthermost houses. The
Milk river is reported to have over
flowed its banks in several of thr; low
places in the west end of town, but
there is no immediate danger from
this source.
The ice has practically all gone out
of the river and the danger of nn ice
jam has been overcome. Tuesday dyna
mite was used to I r.-sak up stme of the
sMiall jams in
e'^cct.
the river with goodj
Wednesday
morning
!
ous residents found that water had
come into their basements, having j
backed up through the sewer, and
pumps and water buckets were in
great demand for awhile There ar«j
several feet of water in the basement j
of the new Rundle building which
backed up through the sewer and sev-1
eral other business places have been
forced to carry goods out of their
!basements to escape the water which
|Was sfce ping in.
The water in the river at Malta,
; has gone down several feet and they
tare all out of danger there but Saco
seems t 0 be in great danger of
J coming flooded again. It was re
ported here yesterday afternoon that
j Hinsdale was under water but this
was dispelled last night when several
res idents of that city who came down'
j on tbe skidoo. stated that while the
: r j V er was running bank full it had
not yet entered the town. There are
i severa l places on the flats above
Hinsdale that are under water caused
in no
by ice jams, but Hinsdale is
immediate danger.
It is believed by those familiar with
conditions, that if the Missouri does
not jam and the night freezes con
tinue, that the surplus water will be
carried off and the danger greatly
lessened. Cherry creek is the chief
cause of worry and every effort will
be made to keep that within its banks,

BIG LAND TRACT
WILL BE LEASED
Opportunities Offered for Renting
State Land at Low Figure.
Register of State Land Sidney
Miller has just issued a booklet which
he is sending broadcast over the
state, calling attention to the excel-1
lent opportunities that fanners and!
stockmen have in northeastern Mon
tana to lease large tracts of state
land at an exceptionally low figure.
Mr. Miller calls attention to the
fact that there are thousands
acres of good agricultural and leas-1
ing land in Valley and Sheridan coun-|
ties which may be leased for a song,!
and which will net a neat profit to 1
the farmer or stockman who gets,
them. In the booklet is set forth in
detail the amounts of land and the
townships in which , they are located.
The grazing land, the booklet sets
forth, will be rented in tracts of
fnma t<> a ^ ^
For quarter the state
recejves from $6 up to $BQ and $100 j
per year, according to the quality of I
the land. Half sections lease from
$12 up, and full sections rent from
Î50 to $100 per year.
For agricultural purposes a quar
ter u.etion may be rented for from
j *20 upward, according to the loca
«on and quality of the land, while
i full sections are listed at from $150
I U P to as high as over $250 per year,
! A part of the land included in the
j lease may be for grazing and a part
for agricultural purposes, or alL may
be for one purpose. A grazing lease
,
may be changed in whole or in part,
! to an agricultural lease by the lessee,^
paying the additional charge for such
j use and obtaining permission fromj
the register of state lands. Rentals
and .fees, are payable in advance.
Leases may be issued for^periods
j of from one to five years. No more
j than 640 acres of state land may be
issued to one person or corporation,
j Lessees are protected in such im

This was the gist of the information
imparted to Secretary Moore of the
Commercial club by Frank L. Sher
man of the Minot Milling company,
who was in the city on Tuesday, mak
ing arrangements for the erection of
the mill here.
Mr. Sherman stated that his organ
ization was ready to start building
the 200-barrel mill whenever the
Commercial club gave them a site. He
stated that Mr. Dunnell, vice presi
ing has already placed the
order for the machinery and this will

of a mill with an initial capacity of

CONCERNING REGISTRATION
I
In answer to an inquiry from Coun- j
ty Attorney George W. Ruffcorn re- j
lative to registration by Notaries, At- j
torney General J. B. Poindexter voi- ^
ces his opinion that it is undoubtedly j
the intent and meaning of the law,
that notaries public should act within
the precinct of their residence only,
If, however, a Notary should register
someone residing outside of his pre-,
cinct. and send the papers to the coun-.
ty clerk, and the county clerk should
accept the same, and no contest or j
exception should ever be taken to it
by anyone, it would probably be ef- j
fective, but it is irregular, and being ■
irregular, it is impossible to predict
what the result would be in case of a
contest made upon such registration,
» the law .s followed stnetly he c
[can be nc grounds for contesting the
egistration. If it is now followed,
an irregularity oasts which may or
may not cause trouble according to
whether it is contested or not.
L
SETTLERS MAY LEAVE LAND.
Allowing leave of absence to set
tlers on unsurveyed land the same as
permitted those on surveyed land
I the national house last week passed
^ resolutif)n 9691
T his bill provides that settlers on
j unsurveyed lands may get permission
| from the local land office to leave
! the Iand for not more than five
months a year. In making applica
tion) however the approx imate loca
tion of the land must be given to
jgether with a statement that the'in.
terior boundary is designated in some
manner.
This will be considerable satisfac
tion to the homesteaders who have
stayed on their land during the win
ter months, not venturing to leave in
fear that someone would jump their
claim in the spring. The bill now
goes to the senate where early ac
tion is anticipated.
WHITE FOUND GUILTY.
T. R. White, formerly postmaster
of Whitetail, Montana, pleaded guilty
this week to the charge of stealing
in the federal court in Great Falls
$2,500 from the Whitetail postoffice.
He pleaded not guilty to the sec
ond charge of embezzlement of funds
which amounted to $2,800. This
charge was dismissed. White was
sentenced to 20 months at hard labor
in the federal prison at Leavenworth
on the first charge.
BEGIN CITY PARKS
CHRISTLER'S PLEA
Prominent Clergyman Here Wednes
day—Urges Tree Planting.
Rev. Leonard J. Christler, the mis
sionary of the western end of the
i Milk river valley mission field, with
headquarters at Havre, while enroute
stopped off for a visit with his
many friends in this city on Wed
nesday. Mr. Christler has a warm
place in the nearts of Valley county
people as is always evidenced by the
cordial reception accorded him when
ever he appears on our streets, und
ho never fails to give our city a goo,'
boost whenever he can get in a vig
orous lick for her.
Mr. Christler's name, like "Brother
Van's," the pioneer Methodist mis
sionary in this county, is known in
every household, for no clergyman
has baptized more children, married
and buried more people, or minist
ered to more homes of trouble and
sorrow than Mr. Christler. That he
never lets .up, but always retains an
infectious interests in the welfare hap
piness and vision of the people of all
northern Montana is demonstrated by
the fruit-bearing work of the system
he is now proposing to towns and
cities of all sizes and stages in
northern Montana for the immediate
development of city parks.
Along with his missionary work
Mr. Christler is appearing before
commercial bodies in a lecture, Real
and False Va lue of the Heathen Dol
lar ,» and by it pleading for the
planting of trees, future park de
velopment, and the all-out-of-doors
development that tends to beautify
streets, homes, lawns, gardens, and
with these the mind and soul.
"Begin a city park right now, no
matter what your assets. If you
haven't sufficient funds, or lack the
patriot to give you land and a start,
then issue bonds to accomplish it, for
in the long run the park and its
blessings to the inhabitants of the
city will be your greatest asset.
Don't wait for years before you
think of a park, while in the mean
time the old 'Heathen Dollar' is mak
i heathen out of every one of
yoU( in that you rob jt 0 f its real
va jy e by wasting or hoarding it in
cbanne i s where it ceases to enrich.
b j ess and up j|ft mankind, and thereby
has accorded it a value that is quite
f a ] se »
Judging from the press reports Mr.
christler's talks along this line to the
comm ercial clubs is doing a lot of
j, ood f or the playground and public
pg,.^ improvement.
mai TA POSTMISTRESS,
• ' • > •
It has been officially announce
from Washington that Miss at'«' '®
Patton has received the appointment
from President Wilson to the office
of postmistress for Malta. The re
tiring postmaster, F. W. St. Hill, was
an appointee of the republican ad
ministration, but has held over until
the present time. Miss Patton is
cashier in the J. F. Kilduff depart
ment store and one of the best qual
ified persons in the city to receive
the appointment. Just when the
change will be made, but Mr. St. Hill
is of the impression it will be April
4, as that is the time his commission
was dated.
LONERGAN GUILTY.
