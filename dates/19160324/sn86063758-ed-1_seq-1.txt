Augusta, Ga., March 23.?Fire, fanned
by a 65-mile gale, last night swept
down Broad .street, destroying 21
blocks of 'buildings on that main
thoroughfare of (Augusta and about 14
on other streets. At 1 o'clock this
morning the flames were still burning
fiercely, with the prospects that it
would 'be probably several hours before
they can be controlled.

ordered out and now are guarding the
streets.
. Thus <ar there have been no fatal
accidents, but there were many narrow
escapes, notable in the Dyer
building, where the conflagation flaci
its inception.
The loss will run well into the millions,
some estimates now putting K
k -as high as $10,000,000.
The flames swept a straight swat'i
down Broad street, skipping only, two
| 'clocks, the 600 and 700 blocks, and taking
in their career many well known
"buildings.
Among the structures completely
destroyed were the Dyer building, a

At the conclusion of the reading of

joggans, tfudge Wilson commended th9
?rand jury i.'or its promptness and attention
to duty. He then commented ^
upon that portion of the presetment
relating to the state of affairs existing

stress upon the gravity of the situation.
He suggested that tbe services .

lieved that a missionary could accomplish,
more than anything else in
thie case. v
.luQ^e Wilson then suggested to Solicitor
Cooper that he have copies of
certain portions of the preesntment
made and forwarded to the trustees
of the two schools, together with a
request that the patrons of Johnston?
iistrict set* together and put a stop to
the existing. friction. If there is a
repetition of the "acts of ?vandali6m/
mentioned in the grand jury's presentment,
the judge directed that the guiK
