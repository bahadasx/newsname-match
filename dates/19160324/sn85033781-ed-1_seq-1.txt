The quarterly meeting of the Free-will
Baptist churches of Van Buren county
washeld with the Paw Paw Baptist
church March 17-19. The churches
were well represented, all but two hav
ing ent a delegation. In opening
session on Friday evening was addressed
by Dr. W. II. Shoemaker, district super
intendent, on the present strategic mo
ment for the churches of Christ in Am
erica. He said that God had given us
an "open door'' to the world and was
only wailing for an agency of sufficient
strength to enter and to complete the
task set us in the great commission of
our Lord. His message was most inspir
ing, especially to those who had any in
clination to pessimism.
The Saturday forenoon session was
devoted to routine business. The quar
tnrly meeting took a tiru, stand in favor
of tbe complete union for the Free-will
and Regular Baptist churches. All the
churches were strongly urged to affiliate
themselves with the Baptist association.
The afternoon session was devoted to a
discussiin of the Five Year Program of
h Northern Baptist convention. Ad
dresses were given by Kev. Shoemaker,
Hon. David Anderson, Kev. D. C. Hen-
8Uaw ami K- v VV. II Moyer. A sermon
of unusual poer was delivered Satur
day evuning by Kev. C. E. Wood ot
Covey Hill.
Sunday morning the Kev. 'J. B. Hart
of jobleville delivered his farewell ser
hod lo tbe quarterly meeting. Mr.
Hart is now over 80 years tf age and
will retire from active service after April
I The following resolutions were drafted
by M. H. Pugsley and adopted by the
quarterly meeting:
liesolutions of Appreciation of the RtV,
C. B. Hart, Veteran Soldier of the
Cross:
For tbe past 50 years the Free-will
Baptist church of Goblevllle has been
one of the most active cbrislian inter
ests in Van Buren county. About 20
yers ago its pastor, Kev. Wm. Walker,
was unexpectedly called to his reward
anu bis intimate friend, Chauncey b.
Hart, came to conduct his burial.
Brother Hart's tirst impression upon
ihe people of Gobies was so favorable
that he was called to tbe pastorate of
the church and foi the past quarter of a
century an mfije'c (or good which
cannot be measuied bas gone out from
bis home, his church, and bis work in
the Van Huren quarterly meeting and
M chigan State association. Like Sam
uel he listened to the call of God tariy
in life. He was like Daniel in moral
courage and like Abraham in faith. Line
Joshua he would see victory where oth-
defeat. He loved bis Master
re-
I'KOK. A. T. I AT I
with his pupils. It is with sincere
gret on the part of the citizens of Paw
Paw, that he has decided to go elsewhere.
There were many applicants for the
Vicksburg position, and tbe fact that
Mr. Patty was selected speaks well of
his ability and popularity. The position
is a good one, and while we dislike to
lose this instructor and his estimable
family we join his host of Paw Paw
friends in best wishes for bis continued
success in the new field of labor,
FOR CARL COLE
Crl Cole, son of Phieeas A. Cole of
Paw Paw had a narrow escape from
death recently. He was on a train in
what is known as Black Canyon, Colo
rado when a huge snow slide from the
mountain side carried tbe train into the
0 unison river. The Montrose Daily
Press of Montrose, Colorado states that
Carl was standing on the platform of the
train with conductor when tbe slide
struck them. They were buried beneath
tbe snow and debris, and but for the
timely assistance of some of tbe passen
gers, both would have had been suffocat
ed. A line to his father states that Carl
came through the ordeal uninjured, but
that it was a narrow escape. Une pass
enger and one mail messenger could not
be found and it is supposed that they
lost their lives in the river.
