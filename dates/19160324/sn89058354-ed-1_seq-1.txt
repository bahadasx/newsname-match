ABOVE 3,000 HOMELESS
Nearly seven hundred buildings in the residence section of
East Nashville are in ruins and more than 3,000 people are home
less, as a result of the most disastrous fire in the history of Tennes
see capital which raged all day Wednesday and late into the night
following. The flames, driven onward by a fifty mile wind swept
everything before them for fifteen blocks.
Narrow Escapes From Death
When Brick Walls of Church
Collapse on Sunday Morning
While the preacher was in the
midst of his sermon at the color
ed Methodist church Sunday
morning, the roof of the building
was discovered to be in flames.
Members of the congregation
rushed from the building and
turned in the alarm. The fire
company hurried to the scene of
the conflagration and made every
effort to extinguish the blaze,
although the flames had gained
such headway that they could
not be checked until all of the
wood work had been destroyed
and the side and rear walls had
fallen in.
Farmers Prepare Land For
Spring Sowing; Plows Have
Been Running Several Days
Taking advantage of the favor
able weather, farmers have been
making considerable progress
during the past week with their
sowing and preparation of land.
Plows have been running in all
parts of the county, some gar
dens have been broken and plant
ed and within the next few days
potatoes will be put in the
ground, provided the weather
should remain fair.

Hillsman Taylor Throws Hat In

Hillsman Taylor, of Trenton,
who is now filling out a part of
an unexpired term as Attorney-

falling bricks and mortar when
the walls collapsed unexpected

ward of $4,500, it is said, partly
covered by insurance. A few of
the benches were saved.
Two houses near the church
building caught from the burn
ing structure, but the flames
were extinguished with small
damage. It is understood that
the negroes will rebuild their
church.
The corn acreage will be very
large in Henry county this year
it is thought. Because of the
warnings that - have been sent
out against the raising of cotton
it is probable that the acreage of
this crop will be reduced in the
county.
Within a short while the spring
pastures will be ready. A few
more warm days will cause the
grass to grow wonderfully.

ESTES STORY CAUSES
TO
Friends Of Governor Take Ex
ceptions To Article In The
Parisian
STORY PRINTED AND PAID
FOR AS AN ADVERTISEMENT
Committee Calls Upon Mana
ger Of Tennesee Press
Bureau At Paris
An article sent out to the
newspapers of the state by the
Tennessee Press Bureau and
published in The Parisian, as
paid advertising, last week re
sulted in a, big political storm
breaking in Paris Thursday night
a week ago, when Governor Rye
hurried here from Nashville and
a committee of his friends
rushed to the home of the mana
ger of the Tennessee Press Bu
reau in an automobile, only to
find that the newspaperman had
already come to town.
; The manager of the bureau
was soon found in Paris and in
stead of attempting to run away
from the committee, told them
he prepared the story from in
formation received from Mem
phis, that he was paid for his
trouble and that he would be glad
to furnish them the letter from
which he secured the informa
tion.
It looked as if friends of the
governor censured The Parisian
for printing the article as a paid
advertisement, but when they
considered the matter they soon
came to realize that The Parisian
has a perfect right to accept ad
vertising from whom it pleases
and when it pleases, and so the
affair ended.
Attorney General Z. Newton
Estes, of Memphis, about whom
the story was written, did not
hesitate to give the whole matter
to the public in the News Scimi
tar Friday, stating that he made
no direct charge that Gov. Rye
had talked to members of the
Legislature about the impeach
ment trial of Judge Edgington
and himself, but that he said
that there was a well defined ru
mor current in Nashville to that
effect, and that he believed that
if the matter should be investi
gated that affadavits could be
secured from certain state sena
tors substantiating the rumor.
The Parisian has never stated
that Gen. Estes was innocent of
the charges but has said that
his friends insist that he is inno
cent The Parisian only feels
that fair play should be accord
ed him. The Parisian thinks
that every man is entitled to this
and hopes that Gen. Estes, as
well as well as Judge Edgington.
will be given a fair and impar
tial trial and that if they are
guilty that they will be given the
punishment they deserve, and
that if they are not guilty .that
they will be exonerated. The
Parisian has said no more
than it will say again and
it stands ready at all times to
sell its space at so much per.

Considered ProbablyThat Meet
ing Will Be Harmonious
In Every Way
POW-WOW WILL BE CALLED
TO ORDER BY THE CHAIRMAN
Only Business Of Importance Is
Naming Delegates Walsh
For Commissioner
Henry county Democrats will
meet at the courthouse Saturday
afternoon at 1 o'clock for the
purpose of electing and instruct
ing delegates to the state con
vention, which will be held at
Nashville May 17. Every indi
cation points to a harmonious
meeting.
The convention will be called
to order by T. B. Gardner,
chairman of the county commit
tee, after which a chairman and
secretary will be elected. The
only other business to come be
fore the meeting will be the
election and instruction of dele
gates, which will probably be
done by resolution.
While Rye has considerable
opposition in the county, it is not
likely that any effort will be
made to prevent instructions for
him, as it is generally believed
that he will have no opponent
for the nomination.
" Friend3 of Thos. J. Walsh, of
Humboldt, candidate for railroad
cammissioner, have been insist
ing that Henry county instruct
for him, and some of the politi
cians who keep posted on local
conditions believe that he will
get Henry county. There is
some sentiment for an uninstuct
ed delegation, however, and for
this reason it is possible that
Mr. Walsh will not get the in
structions.
Following the recommendation
of the county committee, the
convention will probably instruct '
for J. W. Lewis for a member of
the state convention platform
committee, although it is very
improbable that any instructions
for members of the state com
mittee or delegates to the nation
al convention will be given.
During the past week a num
ber of counties throughout the
state have named their delegates
to the state convention. Among
the counties that have acted are
Washington, Carter, Hamilton,
Cannon and Coffee. Washing
ton, Hamilton and Carter in
structed for Walsh, while Cannon
and Coffee went for Enloe in the
railroad commissioner race.
W. O.W. RALLY AT MAYEIELD
March the third is W. O. W.'
rally day at Mayfield. Hon. W.
A. Fraser, sovereign commander,
of Omaha, Neb., will give a
public address at the courthouse
in the afternoon. There will be
a parade at night, followed by a
class introduction of eighty-five.

Degree work will be 'exempli

HAS LARGE CONGREGATION
A large crowd heard the pas
tor, Rev. J. L. Horton, at the
eleven o'clock service at the
Puryear Methodist Church last
Sunday. At three o'clock in the
afternoon Rev. Horton preached
at Conyersville.
