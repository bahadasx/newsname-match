INTIMATED BY CLOSE FRIEND
THAT ROY SHORES HAS ASPIR-
ATIONS FOR SEAT IN STATE
LEGISLATURE.
HERE MAY BE
A CANDIDATE,
10 KNOWS?
Well, linve you heard it?
If you have not, just keep your ear
"attuned" and you will hear a noise
like Roy Shores running for the legis
lature. Now Roy, in his modesty, has not
confided this to the press, but in a
conversation with friends at the hotel
last night, he intimated most strongly
that he had felt a call to the legis
lative halls of the state, and it is
generally understood that when one
hears a "call," whether in religion or
in politics, that the aforesaid partv
is not so very long in heeding it, as
it leads directly away from the mad
dening heat of the fallow fields where
the cornstalks waveth and where the
cotton is in bloom.
Roy wouldn't make a bad legislator
at all. He Is well known and popular
throughout this section, and, in fact,
all over the state. He Is a youn;?
man of exceptional business ability,
and has stability of character enough
to resist the wiles of the professional
politician and habitual member, whi
usually makes headquarters in what
is politically termed the great county
of Lee Huckins, and try, sometimes
successfully, to mould the destiny of
the state.
Roy Shores is well known In the
insurance world, and has been identi
fied with a prominent local agency for
some time. He would fill the office
acceptably to the constituency, and
should he decide to enter the-race, he
would make it exceedingly interesting
for any who might oppose him.
However, be has not announced yet.

is known throughout the state, he had
no idea that it was doing the things

Chancellor Gidney, in his address to
the members, recited some history of
the order from Its foundation, and
quoted many instances where it had
been a potent factor In times of direj
distress. He urged every member to
study the order and to always be
active in advancing its welfare.
The musical feature, in the nature
of the Saxaphone Sextette, was the
greatest surprise of all to him, and
the hoys lived up to the reputation

that the musical organization bo taken
to the grand lodge at Tulsa in May,
and was again surprised to learn that
this had already been decided upon.

made by local and visiting Knights,
served by the Pythian Sisters in th.i
club room.
Individual members have donated
funds to defray the expenses of th
Sextette to Tulsa, and Myrtle lodge

counter attacks. At dawn the
