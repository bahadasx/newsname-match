THEN RUIN
To tlie members of the Farmer's
Umon aud)the farmers generally
throughout the cotton States--'i;he
other day Tread from a report that
,there 'are 92,000 farms inTexas
' which have no cows, 124,000 which
have no pigs, QO.000 without pool
$ try,30G farms .that do not grow a
. pound of hay and 369,000 that raise
. no sweet potatoes. .This statement
y is more than surprising;, it is ap
, palliug. If these are conditions iu
Texas, one of the greatest farming
Spates, they exist to as great or
greater degree in, the'other cottou
grovving States'of the South.
' There is the seat of our trouble
p here iu the South. Tco many of
ws are continuing to concentrate
on otie product alone cotton. As
'long as you keep on raising nothing
but cotton and paying out your cot-,
ton for forage and feed aud clothing
v . instead of; making your farm fur
: nish your living to you, you are
never going to get anywhere7, and
theniost of the time you'll be in
-Right at this time, Especially, I
' want to 'caution you and caution
' "you agaiust an all-one-crop- this
year. As sure as.yon continue to
devote youf attention wholly to'
' . cotton this year you are going to
come out at the little'end of the
' horn. There is uo dodging it.
1 You all remembetf what happened
in 1914 when the European war
began, , You remember t how it
frightened you, how "it left you
. with scant rations 1 because you
failed to make your food at home
- and had nothing but low-priced
, cotton not enough to. pay your
.' ' debts. :r '...'- "s... . ,
, . Well,. if .you don't look' out the
r same 'thing' is'" going to happen
t again. A big cotton crop this year
is going to spell the same sort of
. ' disaster for you that you experi
enced in 191,4', if not worse! .The
" , pricels down now aud it is staying
down Just you plant a big crop
, aud you'll aee it tumble lower still.
Some millions of bales of last year's
crop are still being held because of
' present prices." Suppose you add
au other pig crop to this stock on
hand y'ou know very ' well what
.would happen,' aud if yon don't?
look out it will happen, '
. After the' disaster of 1914 farm
V era of the South planted more for
. age aii3 food crops than ever before
. " and they began to raise cows and
' pigs,1 Those who were fortuyate
enough to-do that know how well
- they profited by it; know that.even
witli the better1 price for cotton,
; they would have had a hard time
, . . if tber hadn't doue.it. v
- ' The European war is not" oyer;
- there is no telling when it will
. end. ' It .may go . on for several
1 ' "yea?e. ; -Cettairily it will not end
this year, and probably not, next,
f . The German, Austriau aud Rus-
' ' ' wau markets are closed tight
' - Bgaiust our ' cottonj: the world'
-' consumption is reduced by several
. i -million bales. How can you hope
for higher prices if you make a big
" ' crop? It is out of the question
v ;. , : J3pt if ypu will ; o ahead and
' .make, your own living at home,
- " make some food products to sell
fb the world uas got to eat you
will come out all right no matter
i what happens to cotton. Not only
V that. but witli the Sorter crop yu
V ' " will get your own price for it, or at
' least come nearer it than you ever
" Every one of those 92,000 farms,
thouv 124,000-, farm,' those C0.000
farms jir Texas; should not only
have cows and , pigs and poultry,
but they should . grow their own
grain and forage and garden truck
instead of paying two priees for it
in cheap- cotton. This applies
equally to conditions in every cot
ton State in the South, to every
farmer who grows cotton at all.'
This is absolutely, the only road
to farm independence, to your inde
pendence. You had better take it
now, If you disregard this injunc
tion aud plaut cotton, cottou,cot
totij uuti.il there is .nothing else on
your place,. set it down right now
that when .harvest time comes you
are going to; be wearjug the same
long face yoiv wore iti the fall of
1904. It will be as bad, if not
worse. . . '
If I kuew how to to ake the pic
ture auy gloomier, I would do it,
aud then not depart in the smallest
degree from the truth.
You can avoid it by cutting down
your cotton acreage and making
your own living on the farm. If
you dout do it you are goiug to
suffer. There is rio-escape from it.

. President Farmers' Union.

A group of ch ildren were play ing
on the grouud, their faces none toa
clean, their hands worse, and their
clothes of the earth earthy. A rag
doll lay hard by; a little mduud of
dirt, shaped like a minature grave,
with a stick stuck at the head and
another at the foot' told the story
of pathetic play. "Who"s dead?"
the writer asked. "The doll" came
the inconsistent but ready answer,,
seeing that the grave was finished
and the doll was not in it,- "What
was the matter with' the doll?""
came next, and quick as a flash one
of the boys answered r' 'Pneumonia
fever.". Tfiere they were playing
life and death. Children do what
they see grown folk do, go where
they see grown folk go, say what
they hear - grown folk say. The
reason more children donot go to
church is because more grown f61k
do not go. . The best way in the
wide world to get children to trarvel
the way to life eternal-is for grown
up people to travel the way to life

has just rounded out his 12th year

to calculations, Joe has traveled
56,000 miles or two and one half
tijpaes around the globe.
He made the first trip" ou the

made it three times a week since,
with the exception of three mouths
when he went every day. He is
17 years old but mkes the trip of
24 miles iu, seven hours, aud with
good roads comes in ahead of time.
His record for behavior is not so
good as he has ruu away and torn
up three new buggies. He is still
active enough to jump a 5 foot

hat. He has the same opinion of

Bi- F. DA VI DSON . &
The.', Birth of a Nation," D. W.
Griffith's massive sjectacle7 com-, ,
ing to the Dixie Theatre at Paris', ,
Tenn., April 5-7-8, is the largest
aud most important production of t
a decade, yet not a' word is spokeu v;
throughout the performance of
nearly three hours. Music sup- .1,
plies the absceuce of speech, me-
chauical effects and. realism, whilst '
the wizard of the screen, David W. ? ',
Griffith, uufolds in, 12,000 feet of
film the thrilling fomauce of the
war between the States aud the
reconstruction o the Southlaiid.,
Some idea of its. magnitiule may
be had from the facts -that 18,)00 v
actors and .3,000 horses took 'part v
aud that the staging of this great ; -
"ontdobi" drama cost half a mil-
lion dollars. " ' , - ; .
Several of the actors - are ' of ;
Southern -lineage. Henry" Wal-' :
thall, who plays the heroic. role of
the little Confederate colonel, is a
member of the) well-known Wal- ,
thall family of Alabama. JMiriam .
Cooper, who appears as Margaret
Camerou, is a direct descendant of '
Charles Carroll, the" Mary liiud sign
er of the Declaration of Iudepeud- -
euce. Mr. Griffith is the sou. of a
brigadier general of the Confeder
ate-Army. - ' -
For every ' character, however '
small, Mr, Griffith has found just,
the personality needed. ; After that ' -his
masterly direction .made each
one give a perfect charadterizatibn '.
of the widely, varying roles. The
result was not acting but life itself.
Such realism is never seeu on the ;
old-fashioned stage. The Tim ita- -
tions of the theatre were swept
away for Nature wasjllr; Griffith's
stage." Panorama after panorama
is revealed to the astonished eyes
of the spectator. The most inveu-
tive imagination could hardly pic
