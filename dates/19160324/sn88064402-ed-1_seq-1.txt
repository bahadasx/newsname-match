Rev. B. M. Shive of Atlanta.
Rev. HL. I. ,iiie. D. D., lxecuttive
represents' oon of Ogiethorpe Univer,.i
ty, filled tht, pulpit of the Presbyterian
Church Sunday morning and evening.
At the morning service he told the
story of Oglethorpe University, giving
its history from its early founding as
the first Daencminational College in the
seuth, its devastation during the civil
war, its resurrection and effort to im
mortalize the old in titution by the
erection of a grea(t University to meet
the urgent needs and requirements in
the education o; the youth of our
land.
His presentation was clear and forte
ful and made a strong appeal to the
thoughtful and those who feel a con
cern for the future welfare of the
young people.
As a result of his efforts here $1105.00
were pledge by some members of the
Presbyterian Church to aid in this
great undertaking, and assurance was
given of additional amounts later.
According to the plan of the founders
every $1000.00 entitles the individual
donor or church to representation on
the Board of Founders. Thus this
church will have representation on that
board, and perhaps, through additional I
subscriptions, a second representative
may be secured. At the evening service
Dr. Shive preached a strong sermon on
"Providence," and showed God's hand
in all the affairs of His Kingdom.
After four days spent in the interest
of his work, together with some pleas
ant recreation and sport with the finny
tribe he left Thursday morning via
Lake Charles, Bunkie and other points
in the State, expressing hearty ap
preciation of the generosity of this
people and a high esteem for our coun
try.
A PLAIN TALK TO VOTERS
I am a candlidate for the office of
Sheriff and I am very desirous of secur.
ing your votes and your active support.
I will not insult your intelligence by
handing you a lot of bunk which means
nothing and cnmits n:e to less than
nothing. That is not my way.
But if you vote for me it is my wish
that you do so with the assurance that
I have no mas.ters otlher than the peo
pie ano the laws of the people; that 1
will have ahicsolutely no personal favo
rites after election; that I will strive to
the utmost to honestly and fearlessly
perform the duties ot the office; that
my only guide in the performance of
those duties will be the law as it is en
acted by thoe in power; that all men
will look alike to me while 1 am in of
&_e; that the ".'.!y politic is the master
and that I am its humble servant, obey.
ing its will as expressed by the law re
lating to the office to which I aspire.
If under these conditions you can
consistently favor me with your sup
port, then I will be profoundly grateful.
I can offer you no greater reward
personally than my gratitude, for of
flcially I can do no more for you than by
those in power; that the law will apply
to all persons alike, rich or poor; that
all men will look alike to me while I am
in office.
If in the exercise of the right of your
franchise you feel it your duty to sup
port some other candidate, be sure
there will be no hard feeling on my
part. Your own conscience is your
guide, as mine is my guide when I go
to the polls. It will not affect my
friendship or good will toward you in
the least.
But I do want and earnestly solicit
your vote and your active support, and
I am taking this public method of
speaking straight to you over my own
signature.

Mr. C. M. Shoemaker this week
abtained a cash deed to one-half section
of land north of town from Mr. S. 0.
Scoggins the consideration being a little
aver $14,000.00. It is Interesting to note
that Mr. Shoemaker moved to Welsh
just seven years ago and began farm
ing. Since that time he has accumulat.
ed in addition to the above amount,
about $2500.00 in buildings and improve.
ments on the farm and about $5,000.00
worth of stock and farm machinery.
He has also during this time purchased
another 80 acres of land adjoining him
and has it practically paid for. This is
another striking example of what can
be accomplished in this Welsh country
by a man who is industrions. Would
that we had more men like Mr. Shoe
maker.
