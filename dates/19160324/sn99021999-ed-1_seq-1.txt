SUPERIOR MILL AND
LIGHT PLANT BURN
Fire Which Starts from Overheated
Bearing Causes Loss of Hun
dred Thousand.
SMALL HOUSES ALSO DESTROYED
SUPERIOR, Neb., March 23.
(Special Telegram.) Fire, which
broke out in the flour mill of the
Superior Milling company here to
day, destroyed this building, the
mill and elevator of the Superior
Corn Products' company and the
local electric light plant before It
was checked. The losa Is estimated
at $100,000. The-' flames started
from an over-heated bearing.
Fanned by a heavy gale from the
aoutheast, which swept the flaming
firebrands straight toward the busi
ness center, "the city was threatened
with destruction by fire for several
hours by flames which broke out
from a hot boxing In the milling
plant owned by David Outhrie and
operated under a lease jointly by
Ernest Meyer & Bona and the Su
perior Corn Products company.
The mill, as well as the light and power
plant of the South Nebraska Power com
pany, and several frame residences and
outbuildings went before the fire was
gotten under control, and for a time It
was feared the flames would spread to
the most heavily built-up sections of the
city
Water Sapply Partly Cmt Off.
The water supply of the city was In a
large measure dependent upon the burning-electric
power plant, and when that
failed matters took on a serious aspect,
but by carefully husbanding the supply
on hand Mayor W. 8. Young and Chief
George Johnson were able to get the fire
under control after It had burned for two
hours, and It is not tbought further dam
age Is imminent.
The fire la said by James Charleton,
employe of the mill, who was called from
his dinner by the alarm and was the
first person on the scene, to have started
about a shaft boxing on the second ffoor
of the mill shortly after noon, but It
spread so rapidly that In ten minutes it
was beyond all hope of control, and In
less than half an hour the huge building,
together with the power house, a frame
and brick structure situated fifty feet to
the south of the mill building proper,' was
but a smouldering heap c' ruins, and the
flames spread north to houses occupied
by the mill employes.
Hrandn t arried Half Mile.
The buildings of the Alfalfa rroducts
company, which stand a hundred feet
east of the mill, were saved by the fact
that the wind blew the fire directly away
from them. Fire brands from the mill
were carried half a mile northwest and
set fire to the premises of F. V. Bishop
and the the roofs of several frame houses
In the intervening space, but these fires
were extinguished without loss. Crowds
are still watching the burning erasers, aa
a high wind continues, and with the fail
ure of the auxiliary water supply, the
town would be at the mercy of the fire
If It should gain a start In the district
threatened, which la comprised entirely
of small frame houses. The property
loss at this time is estimated at :oo,ono,
partly covered by Insurance. As a result
of the destruction of the . power plant
Superior Industries are at a standstill,
and Its residents are without lights. (Jas
oline engines are at a premium and local
dealers have disposed of oil lamps down
to the 112 model.

FIGHT ON SEVENTY-MILE FRONT
' PKTKOGRAIl, March 23. (via
London.) The Ru-Rlan drive In the
vicinity of Lake Narocz. according
to reports received here, hss car-
tied them through three lines of
German trenches. The Russians
routed the Germans by bayonet
fighting, rapturing more than 1,000
prisoners and a doien machine guns.
While admitting that it is not
yet clear whether the fighting which
is In progress south of Dvinsk sig
nifies a general advance of the Rus
sian troops in that sector or whether
it is intended as a demonstration to
attract German forces from the
Kranco-German front, the military
critics lay emphasis upon what they
allude to as the universal success
of the attacks during the last few
days, the vlclousness of which Is
pointed to as being sufficient to
have made an impression upon the
German general staff.
Move In Three C.roape.
The Russian troops are operating In
three groups covering a front of seventy
miles, tiut the severest fighting Is re
ported to have occurred in the vicinity of
i.w. vror. where the Russians' drive
carried them through three lines of Ger
man trenches heavily protected by wire
entanglements. The Russians resorted to
hir favorite method, bayonet fighting
.,.r , Germans In spite of desperate
resistance and capturing more than 1.000
men. Including seventeen officers, a doxen
m.hiu turn and other booty,
The Germans are Invariably countering
.i. . n.i..in attacks bv advancing at

i.n..rtni according to the military
obtervers. the Teutonlo efforts lack co
ordination anfi It Is evident that In spite
of the recent concentration of additional

pated any plans their adversaries may
have had for a concerted offensive here.

consequence of the passing of a resolu

A great sensation haa been aroused over

Confidence Is the keynote of the Moran
