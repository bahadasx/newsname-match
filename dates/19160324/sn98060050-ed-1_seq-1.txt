The Dutch refuse to be soothed by
the declaration ficii Berlin that the
stcnms.hip Tub-ntia vtrs not torpedoed
by u (jiinmin rt-l'inniir.e. They arc not
disposed tu nfcopt tho t.crman denial
! fi'ifi', and they lfmnip full of wrath.
They hiivo s-ome ji'sliiictition for their
doubt, since the sinking of tho Dutch
boat would be hnrd to explain in any
other way, and since Germany's words
and Germany's deeds in the matter of
tho submarine warfare arc frequently
not in harmony. Wo remember the tor.
pedoing of the Arabic, after the prom
iso hnd been given that there were to
be no more Lusitanin affairs, and tho
torpedoing of the Hesperian even later
than that.
In his speech before the I'ninn
League in Philadelphia Senator John
W. Weeks of Massachusetts compressed
all the meat In the eocoanut into ono
short sentence, to wit: "The receipts
from customs have been reduced more
than 10 per cent; the receipts from in
terim 1 taxes have increased 50 per cent
and tho total taxes collected havo in
creased about 18 per cent, wliilo tho
total expenditures of the government
havo increased 25 per cent." This is
ono way of showing that under our
preson't' fiscal policy 'wo are running
.tmr'goveniihv'nt on the- money that it
owes.

The passing of tho log drive mark

torv. Two factors havo contributed
to tho end of a custom followed more
than half a century. The building of
power plants has added to tho expense
of floating tho logs to their destina
tion, and the logs have interfered
with the rights of motor boat owners
Hereafter the logs will be sawed int
marketable lumber near tho big for
ests around the headwaters of the
Connecticut and will bo shipped from
various points by rnil. Years ago tho
Iocs went as far south as Hartford
which at that time was tho New Kng

elled to furnish electric current for
lighting and power purposes to indi
vidunls. The petitioner!) claim that
tho charter of tho company requires
mo company to do so when properly
requested. Tho company asserted that
t is, and lias been, ready to furnish
power to citizens of Dummcrston
through some association or company,
but is not compelled to retail it and
ocs not do so anywhere.
These claims were made on a T)cti
ion of citizens of Dunimerston asking
the commission to issue an order com
pelling the company to furnish tho
power. Tho petitioners were E. C.

that nil tho petitioners had to do was
o guarantee that amount and the
power company would provido some-
ono who whoulil build the line. The
company is ready to sell .electricity at
two nnd a hnlf cents a kilowat.
Tho 7ietitioners, through Attorney
W. P. Daley, wore not ready to guar

list of 10 names of citizens who are
ready to take electricity and of five
moro who aro almost certain prospects
In addition to that the church, the
town hall, tho Grange hall and the vil

is compelled to furnish electricity to

Holstein-Friesian Directors Will
Lease Proposed Structure
To Bo Occupied as Secretary's Office
Tlreproof Building Will Stand
Where Young's Btoro Is.
(Hpccial to The I'hoenix.,)
SYRACUSE, X. Y., March 22.
As a result of a nieetiim liero yester
day of the board of directors "of the
llolstein-l'rieslan Association of Amer
ica, of which Frederick L. Houghton
of Brattleboro is secretary, Brattle-
ooro is assured ot another large nnd
substantial office building.
The meeting was held in the Yates
hotel and several matters of business
wero transacted, tho most important
of which was a voto to accept a pro
posal mado by Arthur B. Clapp, a Brat
tleboro banker and prominent business
man, to erect a thoroughly modern fire
proof building and lease it to the asso
ciation for u term of years for tho
secretary's office.
Mr. Clapp is to give the association
a lease of the building ut 10 per cent
of the coSt, which is not to exceed
$55,000. The building is to be located
on n prominent corner and is to bo
erected the coming year.
The directors have realized for some
time the advisability of having tho
secretary's offico in a fireproof build
ing, because of the vast number of
valuable records, which aro kept in
Tiling cabinets, and it was their opinion
that it would be better to accent Mr.
Clapp 's proposal than to undertako to
make tho present quarters in the Amer
ican building meet the requirements.
Secretary Houghton attended tho
meeting, also Houghton Seaverns of
of Brattleboro, manager of the secre
