SHINGTOX, D C, March 21.
The question of calling the
Itlonal guard for border duty
to release regulars for service In
Mexico was discussed at today's cabi
net meeting, but it was decided there
was no prospect of such action at this
time.
Senator Lewis, Democrat, declared
In a resolution introduced today in the
senate that American authorUies had
knowledge of supplies and money be
ing furnished to VHJa from foreign
countries and from the United States.
His resolution proposed to ' brand
Americans who give such aid as
"guilty of actual treason."
At the request of senator Borah.
Republican, the resolution was read
twice, and then senator Lewis asked
that it Me over and gave notice that
he would soon speak upon it.
Some of the border senators read
telegrams from cltixens expressing
apprehension for the safety of Ameri
can Interests along the Mexican line
and senator Stone renewed his appeal
to senators not to agitate the situation.
The discussion died without action.
Vo Truth In Revolt Letcher.
American consul Letcher at Chihua
hua today reported there was no truth
in the report of Gen. Herrera and the
Carranza garrison at Chihuahua, hav
ing revolted
Consul Letcher's dispatch reported
that Gen. Herrera was in command of
the de facto troops there and was
loyal to Gen. Carranza
His report Is regarded a removing J
one of the most menacing features of
the Mexican -ituntion
Although Gen Funston and Brig Gen.
ReU on tbe border received reports con
firming the story of the revolt, the dis
patch from consul Letcher, who Is on
the ground and had headquarters at
the place where the revolt was said to
have occurred, is taken by officials here
a? confirming the statement of Car
ranza officials that no such revolt has
occurred.
American Returning From
Front Says Americans
Bar Villa's Retreat.
American troops are in Madera, ac
cording to news brought to the border
Friday, by an American who was In the
Casas Grandes country after that dis
trict was entered by the troops under
Gen. Pershing. The movement of the
troops south into the territory where
the Pearson interests are established
upon so large a scale, and whose prop

effected by us use of the railroad track
of the North Western, south of Casas

The inference is that additional troops
of tho American expedition have pene
trated further into the district of Guer
rero and that a strategic cordon has been
drawn by the use of the railway, com
pletely shutting off anv passage of the
Villlstas down Into Rayon and Arteaga.
The bridges between Guerrero and Ma

by Villa on his last march north, out
these, with the service of the engineer- i
ing corps could be quickly restored and

Another strategic movement ot
American troops was the passage of CoL
Dodd and his column of cavalry down
from Casas Grandes to El Valle and
later Into the Namlquipa district, where
the Carrancistas are reported to have
engaged Villa's forces.
The movement of the American
troops from Casas Grandes has been
guarded with the greatest secrecy, and
save that the railroad transferred troops
from Casas Grandes to Madera and
south, little additional can be learned.
Madera is directly opposite Xarai
