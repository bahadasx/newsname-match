Dissatisfaction among the ma
jority of business men and tax
payers of Clovis, in tke selection
of some aldermen on the citizens
ticket and the endorsement of
some "I am running the town"
supporters of that ticket, were
the chief facto, s that led to the
nomination of an INDEPEN
DANT PEOPLES TICKET at a
mass meeting of citizens and
tax payers held at the- Elks lodge
hall last night. The statement
of those who for personal or
Helfish motives dubbed the move
ment that of "disgruntled wets
and socialists," is not one of
facts. If the News thought that
prohibition had anything to do
with the matter, we would re
fuse to be a party to it, but it
DOES NOT and CANNOT, be
cause the prohibition question
was settled last month for a
period of FOUR YEARS and
there will bo at least another
city election and poisibly two
before it could be revived in any
instance.
K. C. Childers was endorsed
or in other words nominated on
the Independent ticket for
mayor because he was thought
to be well qualified for the place
and no opposition ever developed
against his nomination. The
same is true of the city clerk
and city treasurer, though some
dissatisfaction by the other
banks against the treasurer was
n evidence.

'THE STORE OF QUALITY"
The heads of the Democratic.
Republican and Socialist parties
in Clovis are supporters of the
Independent ticket, because they
are tired of this "two men rule
the town" system. The men
nominated for aldermen are all
prominent business men who
own property and have been
closely identified with the best
interests of the city for years.
Mr. Curless of the first ward has
never been too busy with his
own affairs, but that he had
time to put in some effective
work for the city. Any chair
man of the Chamber of Com
merce will verify the statement
that Mr. Curless was one of the
mainstays in the organization
and one who could be called upon
and depended upon at a'l times,
to do all he could for the upbuild
ing of the community. The
same might te said of the other
nominees, though they have not
been so intimately associated
with the "booster" organiza
tions, W II. Duckworth was selected
as chairman of the meeting and
Fritz B. Herod as Secretary.
The following aldermen were
nominated: "
1st ward, Bert Curless
2nd ward, Joe Sellers
3rd ward, J. A. McFarlin
4th ward, A. L. Gurley.
RESOLUTIONS
Resolutions offered by A. E,
Curren were freely discused and
unanimously adopted. Those in-1
terested in the proposed increase
in the water and light charges
and the $35,000 bond issue real
ized that now is the time and
that that was the place to dis
cuss the matter. It is needless
to state that the people of Clo
vis own the $125,000 water and
light plants and are paying
taxes upon that issue. To issue
$35,000 more is t o impose a
burden of $100,000 taxation up
on the property owners of Clo
vis and it is time that thepeoplo
were aroused to the situation.
The purpose of the appointment
of a committee is to determine.
if possible, if the amount asked
for is needed or excessive and
to enlighten the public on the
matter before the day of voting.
Following is the resolution
adopted:
Be it hereby resolved and that
it is the sense of this meeting
that the candidates here nomi
nated on the INDEPENDENT
PEOPLES TICKET shall pledge
themselves to support the fol
lowing issues to wit:
That we favor a reduction in
the water and light charges in
so far as it is practical to reduce
them; that we favor an exten
sion of the water and sewerage
lines to meet our requirements
and that additional fire plugs be
located so as to afford better
protection, in the outlying dis
tricts, but that a bood Usue of
$35,000 my be excessive for
such purpose. We fivir tn
issuance f bonds in sued sum
only as mty b nec-mry for
the improvements mentioned
To this mi I we deem itexnedi
ent and so recommend that a
committee be appointed consist
ting of five taxpayer; sai l com
mittee lo investigate in- matter
of improvements as cmremplat
ed; the sum they consider ne
essary tocomolete such improve
ments and to report in writing
on or before the da'e of thd lat
publication oflhi Cl'vunevn
papers, prior to (he date of
election, in order that such re
port can be published and the
public enlightened on this sub
ject. That we believe such an
investigation and report is nec
essary in order for the tax piy
ers to vote intelligently on the
issue.
Be it resolved further; that we
believe that the salaries paid
some City employes are po-aibly
excessive and that reductions
might in some instances be made
without reducing the efficiency
of the service rendered.
Further, that it is to sense of
this meeting that all jobs for
City work bd let bv co-rract to
the lowest reap insib e bidJe an I
that the expenses be re luced to
the minimu'n.
Those appointed on the co n
mittee of investigUion were
WHY BUY EARLY ?
Maybe you think a retailer is selfish in advising you to buy early in the
season. But the truth of the matter is that you gain as much or more than
he does. First of all, you have a wider selection of stock to choose from
you get what you want when you want it.
Then you make a better investment by buying at the beginning of the
season, because you get a full season's wear out of the clothes
And furthermore, you create the impression among your friends that you
are right up-to-date in your dress. That helps both in business and socially.
Think it over. Then come in and see our Spring stock of Clothcraft

No Wonder
Is there any wonder that the
old regime in the administration
of city affairs is satisfactory to
the Journal, whan Dr. Dillon,
owner of the paper is city phy
sician and Jack Hull, editor, is
city councilman and also city
printer. When the nominee on
the Citzens ticket for city treas
urer was not satisfactory to the
bapks, they did not hesitate to
speak out in meeting. Of course
no one spoke about the citv print
ing or the position of city physi-
cia i and health officer. No one,
nave perhaps the New wan et d
the doctors weiei t era ted in the
other matters aid it would'nt
have been ethical to have nun
tioned it. Are the people any
more interested in the city depos
its than thev are in 1 he other
matters? Perhaps not. After
all it generally depends upon
whose ox in Kored.
McFarlin Builds Brick
J. A. McFarlin, the Grand
Avn ue groceryman, is building
a t vo story brick extension to
his beautiful brick store building
on the comer of Grand Avenue
uid '-litch-fll Street. The ex
tension will extend to the alley
and will ufford him ample room
to d.'wlay his stock to a greater
advai.tntft. Mr. McFarlin is a
popu ar groceryman and enjoys

Cash Grocery Moves
The Cash Grocery, which was
formerly o vned by W. D. Busby
but recently purcha-ied by A. B
Austin of the Model Grocery has

CONDITIONS IN MEXICO
ARE MORE SERIOUS
Two Thousand Carranza Soldiers Join Villa Forces, and
Cut Wires Behind American Commander. Fear that
Other Mexicans will Join Outlaw and that General
War will Result Sherman Wants 50,000 Volunteers.
The New Bank
The Citizens Bank of Clovis
will open for business on central
Main street Saturday March 25.
The building has been entirely
remodeled to suit the needs of
an institution of this kind and it
is a model of beauty and con
venience, It is douotful if any
thing in New Mexico can excel
the interior finishing and deco
rating. The new fixtures which
arrived this week and have been
put into place, are of oak and
white Italian marble. They
represent quite an investment.
S. A. Jones, who was for a
time connected with the First
National Bank, is cashier and
Petree is assistant cashier.
Their policy will be strictly
banking, extending to the public
every courtesy consistent with
conservative banking methods.
George W. Sinjfleton is president
and C. E Dennis and J. A.
Lit i ta are Vice presidents. The
stockholders are all substantial
business men of Clovis and
successful ranchman ef Curry
County.
A Big Airdome.
Again the Hardwicks, who are
owners of the Lyceum and the
Unique, have demonstrated their
ability to keep abreast with the
times and to cater to public de
mands for entertainment, by
commencing the erection of a
large airdome on north Main
street between the old Journal
building and tne new Highway
garage. This is an expensive
investment as the new open air
amusement place is to be one of
the very best that money can
buy and' will be comfortably
seated and well lighted. Score
anotherone for Clovis and Hard
wick enterprise.
The scare over the smallpox
epidemic hae about subsided.
Press dispatches today tell ef
the joining of the forces ef Gen
eral Herrera, military Governor
of Chihuahua, with those of the
bandit Villa and that more are
on the verge of a mutiny against
the Carranza government.
The telegraph wires behind
General Pershing have been cut
in many places and the wireless
out of order, making communi
cation with the front impossible.
Senator Sherman of Illinois haa
introduced a resolution in con
gress asking for 50,000 volun
teers as he anticipates more
trouble. Troops are being rush
ed from all parts of the country
to the berder as the situation is
assuming serious propcrtions.
The advance guard of the Ameri
can troops are close on the heels
of the Villa forces near tne
Sierra Madre mountains and
clashes are believed 'to have al
ready occurred, A captured
Villa bandit teports that Villa
promised each of his bandits an
American woman i f enough
could be taken in .Columbus te
go around.
General Sherman in discussing
the purpose of hia resolution
said:
"I wish now to warn those in
authority in the executive de
partment that we are trifling
with the lives of men, with the
safety of our border states and
with 'our' national honor more
than some seem to appreciate.
"If it be neglected, the delay
then in a crisis will be a blunder
and the kind of a blunder that
is worse than a crime. The best
method of redeeming ourselves
from disaster is to be prepared
before the disaster arrives.
That is the purpose of this
resolution."
J. W. Manning, candidate for
county commissioner from the
Hollene district, .was in the city
on business matters Saturday.
