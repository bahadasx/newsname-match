If the plans of a number of
farmers of tho plains east of
Kenfia materialize, there will
bo several truinloads of fat cat'
tie and baby beeves go out of
Kenna direct to market within
the next 12 months. A number
of farmers in this district have
considerable 1914 gfain on hand
and have decided that this is
tho most profitable way of
marketing it. Some will fatten
calves, while others prefer fat
tening dry cotvs, and in sareral
instances the farmers who only
have a few head will fatten
and ship together. It is pre
dictcifthat this move will have
considerable effect on the local
calf and'grain markat. .
Tin) country newspaper man
who- wrote the following, had
an eye for health and business:
"Some wise peraoa discovered
that it was unhealtky for two
persons to occupy one bed; later
another fcund out that it was
unsafe to ride on a car with
other people, to attend church
where other people attend. An
association of physicians decid
ed that a kias was to tempt
death in all manner of hideous
diseases. Tho very latest is the
discovery of n French 6cintjjt
that the praetice of hand thak

the scene she realised that she had t
forgotten the episode so completely a
she had hoped. i
It was a week after her sister's de
parture and Vera bad bad little tluso
for reverie. For she had discovered
that the care of the charming child
Peggy was enough to keep any grown
woman's mind ocedpied during waking
hours.
Sbe was sitting In the library of the
old city bous. reading b.r the ubdtied
light of the afternoon sun shaded by
the soft silk hangings at the windows.
"Lend me a 'raser. Aunt Vera?"
Pagg? waa sitting on the floor at her
aunt's feet leaning orer her pad.
Vera tossed a rubber-topped pencil
down to the child.
"MuTver doesn't let me hare 'rasers
any more, ' Peggy said smiling. "That'
cause I ate a needed rubber on day.
You know about needed rubbers, Aunt
Vera? I like to eat rubbers."
Vera read on wlthont making any
comment.
"I am drawing you a picture, Aunt
Vera, a picture of Mr. Hush. That'
what I rail him because every time I
poke about the people next door muv
ver Just said 'hush.' And he ia Ui
nicest man nicer than anyone in th
world but you, Aunt Vera. That's why
I am drawing you a picture- of him.
He's just like any other man, ao III
have to make him like the pUture I
did of father for you. Except UrV
Hush hasn't any prickly brush on hit
Hp that bites you when be kisses you
like father. He kissed me today wheat
I was tbere. I asked him for two
kisses so I could bring one with the
cookie to Aunt Vera, and be eatd that
yon wouldn't take the ktas. Aunt Vera,
do you thtuk I am a good drawer?
What's the matter? Don't you Ilka
the picture?" '
Vera was leaning back In the chair;
the book closed and her eyes lowered.
For a minute she didn't know whether
to laugh or to cry, but with a bound
the incorrigible Peggy waa In bar Up
with the picture she had drawn.
- .Vera collected hersert -and looked
severe, ....
"PeggT Jonas, I thought your'
mother said you never went to see the
people in the hohse next door. Doe
nurse take you? How do you get In?"
"Oh, no, Aunt Vera, nurse doesnt
take me. She doesn't know I go. I
just crawl through under the wall at?
the back of the garden. But I don't aa.y
anything about it to muvver, caus
nurse might 'ketch It' If I did and, be
sides, whenever I ask her about those
people she says 'hush.' '
"Say, Aunt Vera, that man hasn't
got any little girls like me sdJ he
hasn't any lady in bis house like muv
ver or anything. He says he is dread
fully lonesome. He says tbere was
lady once who was going to come and
stay with him and play on Lis piano
and sing to him and and everything
but h got mad at him, she did, and
now he is going to"live alone alt hi
life In his house, and he's such a nice
man and maybe if you are a good
auutie' to me I'll take you in to
him some time before mnvver gets
back." )
Vera was holding the Incorrigible
Peggy close to her, bat as she listened
to her story she kept heT face turned
away from th child.
"Say, Anut Vera, Is It most six
o'clock? 'Causa 1 forgot to tell you
that nice Mr. Hush, said he was com
ing to see us when he came home
from down town tonight. He said it
would be six o'clock, bat it I stayed
up I could see him. He said be want
ed to come to see my Aunt Vera only
be was afraid she wouldn't let him.
Hut I said you would. Now, Aunt
Vera, don't tell him I ate the cookie
be went you."
