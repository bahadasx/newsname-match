GETTING CLOSE
REPORTS INDICATE ADVANCE

FUNSTON NOT WORRIED
&
HIS REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL TROOPS
ONLY MADE AS A MEASURE
OF PERCAUTION
El Paso, Texas, March 24.—The Mex
ican officials at Juarez have practically
conceded the outting of the telephone
and telegraph wires betweed Juarez
and Oasas Grandes was the result of a
bandit raid on the Mexican North
western railroad. The extent of the
raid is unknown or being suppressed.
In the absenoe of news from Pershing
and General Gavira, there can be only
conjecture as to the result of the fight
ing between the Villa and Carrarz*
troops, whioh is said to have oaourred
near Namiquipa. There is a strong be.
lief here that Villa oould not have been
at Namiquipa. If true, it is possible
'that he has already olashed with the
American troops, the advance guard of
which were reported yesterday at El
Valle, thirty-five miles from Narni
quipa.
Despite reassuring reports from
Washington, there is no lessening of
the tension on the border, and no
weakening of the freely expressed be
lief of a serious disaffection among
the Carranz* troops. Proof is furnish
ed that the military authorities con
sider the situation on the border far
from satisfactory. On the advise of
Captain Moses, oommander of a cavalry
troops at Fabens, Texas, Dr. Charles
Ricker, a medical officer with the
troop, has sent bis wife and family to
El Paao. She was followed by five
other women residents, including two
teachers, who closed tbo school.
The Texas rangers and oavalry pa
trols have commenced to roundup
Villa sympathizers who are suspected
of smnggling ammunition. Seven of
these have been sent to El Ptiso from
eastern villages and five others have
been arrested at Yaleta.
The Military governor, General
Oalles, of Sonora, has appearently en
tered on a campaign to drive from the
state all connected with the "Cientifloo"
or old Diaz party. He has also ordered
the Catholio clergy from the state
One of bis reoent proclamations oalled
on the people to "exterminate the

bean agitated and on one or two oooa
sions companies have been almost to
the point of being organized to build
one, out for some reason or other the
proposition has fallen fl*t.
We believe that a race track in Hot
Springs is something that is needed
Wbeu this statement is made no doubt
many people living in our sister cities
will frowu on the idea, but when our
reasons are given, we think they will
take a different view of the matter.
In the first plaoe it would hardly be
necessary if one were built to interfere
with the line oounty fairs now being
held either at Edgemont or Buffalo
Gap. la faot a track here would be a
boost for both for the reason that
horsemen oould be iuduoed to winter
bete where the olimate during the win
ter is milder than at most any other
point in the Hills,
Then in the Bpring a race meet oould
be pulled off here and at intervals dur
ing the summer, and the horsemen
making headquarters here would be
glad to wind up the season near home
and both oities mentioned above would
be sure to be benefitted.
As an argument in favor of our con
tention we give below an editorial pub
lished in the Hot Springs, Arkansas,
Sentinel-Record handed us by L. E.
Highley recently aud if a track here
was condnoted in the same manner we
feel sure it would be a big thing for
this town as well as the famous south
ern resort.
"Today at Oaklawn there will be a
revival of the ever popular raoe game
in Hot Springs. The raoe meeting will
be conduoted under the auspices of the
Business Men's League. The raoe
meeting will be kept free from all
things that have marred the sport in
the past. Hot Springs does not take
this interest in sport for the people
of Hot Springs, but because it is a
magnet that attraots a resort patron
age that is the very life blood of our
oity. For that reason we are glad that
the meeting opens so auspioiously, and
we believe that it will close under the
full-schedule under as happy oondl-.
tions. It will have lengthened our
season four or five weeks and will have
given us a prosperity that means much
to our future as a community. The
Business Men's League has made it
possible for racing to be revived under
new oonditions and if these conditions
are rigidly adhered to there is no rea
son why the future of the sport should
not be assured."

MILITARY TRAINING AT U. S. D.
Sentiment Divided on its Proposed Resumpt
ion—His Endorsement of President Slafle
Vermillion, Maroh 24.—Military
training at the University of South Da
kota is advocated as a patriotio duty in
an article whioh appeared last week in
the Volante, the student paper. Glenn
Leavitt, a senior from Arlington,
South Dakota, is the author. He argues
that the University of South Dakota
should adopt a system of military train
ing, including drill and tactics, to help
rurnish a volunteer force trained and
ready in time of national need. "Such
military training," be declares, "is not
intended to install a spirit of hatred
for any nation or nations in those
gathered at institutions of learning,
but to create an army sufficiently large
to discourage attack and at the same
time impart a training that is of value
to eaoh student and to the school."
The writer points out the inoreased
activities along thia line on the part of
other institution?, at Ames, Yale. Cor
nell, Princeton and Conneticut, where
greater effort is being made to assist In

•The issue is one," he says, "that the
University of South Dakota should face
as patriotically and promptly as Yale
or the University of California."
In 190G military training at the Uni
versity of South Dakota was abandon
ed. Its disciplinary features were un
popular with the students, and it was
not supported wholeheartedly by the
administration of the University at the
time. Although the events in the
past
two years have brought a change in
the
attitude of many of the students, senti
ment is still divided in the student
body on the matter. President
