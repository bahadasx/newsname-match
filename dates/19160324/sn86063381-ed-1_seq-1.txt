THE BEMIDJI DAILY PIONEE
by
Edward Rogers, a Chippewa,
county attorney of Cass county, who
is mentioned as a possible candidate
for congress, is against the Indian
lid which governs this territory. In
a letter to a Cass Lake man he
writes:
"I favor temperance legislation but
believe that this should be left en
tirely to the state and local authori
ties I stand unqualifiedly for the
repeal of the Indian treaty of 1855,
which has been invoked during the
last two years. It is an injustice
to the white people it "places the
Indians in a wrong light, and the
methods of carrying out this treaty's
provisions are not at all in harmony
with the American ideas with refer
ence to the making and enforcement
of laws. The provisions in this
treaty relative to the introduction
of liquor into the Indian country was
made for the purpose of keeping li
quor from the Indians and possibly
to prevent outrages on the whites by
intoxicated Indians at the time when
there were but few settlers. Condi
tions have changed since the treaty
was made,"

Cit-
BELIEVE THAT SCOPE OF
OSTEOPATH NOT ENOUGH
Pointed Out Charter Provides That
Majority of Council Must
Vote.
The Bemidji city council at its
next regular meeting will reconsider
the appointment of Dr. P. J. Darragh
as city physician, according to a
statement made to the Pioneer by a
member of the city council this morn
ing.
The member stated that many com
plaints had been received in regard
to the appointment, not because of
Dr. Darragh personally, but because
they believed that an osteopath is
not as capable to handle the import
ant duties- of the city physician's
office as is an "M. D.
Bid $60 Less.
Dr Darragh was appointed at a
meeting of the council last week,
submitting a bid of $540 against the
bid of ?600 submitted by Dr. E. A.
Shannon, who previously was city
physician.
The member of the city council
pointed out that the charter also
provides that the appointment must
be made the first meeting in March.
If the appointment is not made at
that meeting it was stated by the
council member that when the ap
i pointment is not made at the March
meeting the present city physician
holds over.
Ask Reconsideration.
The council member also stated
{that several members of the council
'who* voted for the appointment of Dr.
Darragh will ask^phe council to re
consider.
Dr. Darragh is the first osteopath
in the state of Minnesota to receive
the appointment of city physician.
The appointment is being watched
with much interest by outside people
and may result in a test case.
