CLEARFORK
BOND ISSUE OF
$155,000WANTED
From All Reports Election Will
Carry By Large Majority and
Citizens Will Connect Up
Much Needed Gaps.
The bond issue election in Clear
Fork district will be held next Tues?
day. ? From whut can be gathered
upon inquiry, there will bo but few
votes against it. The district is prac?
tically unanimous, as it should be, on I
this question, which is of vital im
portance( not only to the citizens of |
Clear Fork district, but to every cit
zen of the entire county and even
adjoining counties. There should be
and will not be, it is snfc to predict,
little or no opposition to a move in
which every interest of the communi?
ty is vitally concerned. The pro?
gressive citizens of the great district
will rally cnmassc on Tuesday, and
carry the election with great enthu?
siasm and unanimity. On April 4th, I
the citizens of Jeffersonvillc district!
will rise up and do likewise, for a sim?
ilar issue in this district.
The amount of the proposed issue I
in Clear Fork district is $155,900, and |
in Jeffersonville district, $96,000.
And so, on this round we will clean I
up this bond issue business and be
done with it.
Over confidence has lost many an
election. The Bond Issue for next
Tuesday has opponents working |
quietly against it. Take warning
but take nothing for granted.
Vote on Tuesday and get every?
body else to vote for the Bond Issue.
The bond issue in the Jeffer- j
sonville district will occur on
Tuesday, April 4th.
BEAVEIt HIGH SCHOOL DEFEAT-1
ED BY TAZEWELL TEAM.
The Tazewell High School quint |
closed the basket-ball season last Sat?
urday by defeating Beaver High
School team in the hardest fought
game of the season, by a score of 34
to 30. Tazewell led off with three
field goals and one free goal before
the Beavers could score a single point.
Tazewell kept a very good lead dur?
ing the first half and at the end of
this half the score stood 20 to 11. In
the second half the Beavers scored
three field goals in two minutes, but
then Tazewell came back with three
field goals. The score was close
throughout the whole half, but the
Beavers were never able to catch up
with the locals. Excellent team work
was displayed by both teams, altho
the players were hindered by wet
ground in some plnces. This is the
last game scheduled in the Intcrscho
lastic League.

YOUR ORDER FOR COFFINS.
The State Board of Health, in a
recent bulletin, says that Virginia is
now ordering her year's supply of
typhoid fever, and the number of
coffins she will need will depend upon
?the number of cases she gets. Pre?
ceding the organization of the Board's
fight against fever she had, says the
Bulletin, about 14,000 cases per year.
Since, this number has been reduced
to about 6,000 cases. And this num?
ber of yearly cases can be reduced
if not entirely wiped out by proper
precautions on the nart of every
householder in town and county. Ty?
phoid fever is a preventable disease.
So, the number of coffins you will need
this year will depend upon the clean?
liness nnd henlthfulncss of conditions
around your premises and those of
your neighbor.
March and April are the months
in which to fight. Filth scattered
around bring flics. Look out for the
breeding place of flies. Kill the first
flies at all costs. But it is a waste of
time to kill flies when their breeding
places are left. The horse and cow
barns and unsanitary outhouses ore
the places where flies breed. Com?
mence the fight now, and you may not
need to make an order for coffins lat?
er. ?
?NOTICE TO TRESPASSERS.
All persons are hereby warned not
to trespass on my premises by either

TAZEWELL, VI
ILL VOTE TU!
LAST OF ALLEN
CLAN IS KILLED
Will McCraw Takes Life of Man
Who Figured in Famous Trag?
edy at Hillsville, When Cir?
cuit Judge Was Killed.
The remains of Jack Allen, broth?
er of Floyd Allen, who was electrocut?
ed in Richmond for participation, in
the Hillsville murder, and regarded
as the head of the Allen clan, was
buried on Monday near his homo in
Carroll county, in the presence, the
dispatches say, of a thousand people
from nil parts of the county.
Jack Allen was shot to death last
Saturday night by Will McGraw, at1
a house in which the men were spend
in the night. A dispute arose about
the Hillsville tragedy and it is said
that Allen attacked McGraw, who
drew a gun and shot Allen twice,
killing him dead on the spot. The
killing occurred after the men had
started to retire for the night.
One account states that McCraw
gave himself up and is in jail, another
that he escaped.
The death of Jack Allen makes
eight men dead as a result of the
Hillsville tragedy, with two, Friel Al?
len, Jack's son, and Wesley Edwards,
a nephew, in the penitentiary. Jack
Allen is said to be the last of the
Allen clan. He was about 50 years
old and a man of property. McCraw
is said to be a noted blocknder and
criminal, but this is denied.
BABY BEEF AND CORN CLUBS.
Robert Moss, of Burkc's Garden,
was here last week, and stated with
no small degree of satisfaction, thnt
his boy had entered the contest for
the best, acre of corn, and also the
Baby Beef Club. What better things
could a boy do?
And, it is a cause of congratula?
tion, that the corn clubs, Baby Beef
Clubs, and the Pure-bred Short-horn
association, arc each taking firm hold
in the county. Mr. Montague, the
demonstration agent, is doing a good
work. Gradually but surely, he is
helping greatly to improve conditions
in the county. He has the hearty co?
operation of some of the county's best
and most progressive men, and prov?
ing the wisdom of his appointment.
CAN YOU MATCH THIS. BROTHER
HARMAN?
To the Snake Editor:
I would not start a snake story?
telling contest for anything, but as
"Bro." Harman is responsible for n
whopper, I can hardly resist the in?
clination to match his story by re-tell?
ing one I heard a year or two since?
but you must put the ban on the-mat
ter after this goes in.
To begin: A member of the Vnno
ver family, who answers to the cog?
nomen of "Blackhead," was out in
the mountains, (Cumberland) carry?
ing his gun. Finding some huckle?
berries, he set the gun by a tree, and
proceeded to regale himself on the
luscious berries. When he returned
to the gun, ho saw a large blacksnnke
wrapped about the breech. As he
approached, the "beast" anpeared to
tighten his grip about the lock, when
the piece was discharged. At that the
snake sprang off and was gone. A
squirrel came crashing through the
branches of the tree?shot by the
snake.
Now, Mr. Editor, Vnnover being a
truthful man, pray do not question
Bro. Harman's credulity.

PAYING SMALL DEBTS.
It would be pleasant to do business
if only peoplo would be more prompt
in the payment of their debts. It is
the small debts that worry. The large
debts are seldom made with n cus?
tomer who is not liable and responsi?
ble. If ho doesn't pay up his note
is taken. It is the small debtor who
gives trouble. All of which means, lie
says, that everybody should pay then
bills promptly, und save trouble, and
not abuse the confidence and indul?
gence of merchants. A small bill is
much more easily paid than a large
one. The best plan is to buy for
cash only?have no debts, and in near?
ly all cases this is entirely possible.

Kigbt before his eyes, if he read his
paper, appeared his name on a print?
ed label, with the dale of the expira?
tion of his subscription. There it was
"May, li)15." He took time to write
a lettei, used a sheet of paper, en?
velope and Slump, and the bookkeep?
er took lime to reply, used a sheet of
paper, and made oul a bill, put a 2
cent stamp on it?all amounting to
perhaps 20 per cent of the entire
amount due on subscription, ull of
which expenditure was unnecessary,
and could have been saved, by a glance
at the date on the label. Why will
