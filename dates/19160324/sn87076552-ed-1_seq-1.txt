L NOTES
of 'Economy That Should Bo Con
alder JnveniU Court and Moth
era Pensions.
The question of the'' combination of
the Probate Court and the Court of
Common Pleaa in Fulton County hat
been raised by some of the citiien
and if there are enough of them in
terested in the matter to carry a pe
' tition to the Judge of the Common
Pleas Court, that official may order
the question before the electors of the
county at the next general election,
November 7th; in that case the an
swer to the question will rest with the
voters of the county.
This Is a question which directly
or indirectly interests every citisen in
the county and one which should 10
cetye the careful attention and con-
Eieratioa of every public spirited per
ns for this reason we are placing
faro our readers some points which
are not centrally, taken Into consider,
at Ion t ,
The principal reason for making
this consolidation of the two courts is
, that of economy; the idea Is that if
- the work of the probata Judge is trans
ferred to the Common Pleas Court
' the salary of the probata Judge will
be saved to the county and the Judge
of the Common Pleas court can at
. tend to the duties of both courts.
Aakte- from the regular duties of
the probate court, the probating, re
, cording and other work incidental to
wills, the supervision of estates, hear-
big of accounts relative to same, the
' appointment of administrators, guar
dians) and etc.; the Issuing of mar-
liafa certificates and keeping records
thereef, all duties, which are quite apt
to be very arduous and not very pleas
ant, and many other duties not here
enumerated, there have been added
' -io the work of this court, from time
""to time daring recent years, the
4 Juvenile court and the supervision of
Mothers Pensions. 'With these ad
ditioas the Probate Court became
foadad beyond the capacity of the
Judge and deputy, but they kept up
the work until within the last year
the - Juvenile Court work and the
Mothers Pensions were transferred to
the Court of Common Pleas, and still
' the Probate Court has all that it can
.attend to and both the judge and de
puty are kept constantly busy. While
, the Court of Common Pleas Is over
loaded at the present time.
The merging of these two courts,
wo are informed by parties who have
carefully looked into the matter,
would make a direct saving of (800.00
per year for the county. This com
the maximum, allowing for the ex
tra clerical help, but It does not take
nutation states the money saving at
Into consideration the efficiency and
facility with which it will be possible to
perform the work in this combination
court or the character of the services
which it wiTl bo possible for this
( cotfrt to render to tb public. ( ' v
The - Probate cases proper are of
suctpa nature that they require con
siderable time, no man can render
the best service to the public as a
judge of probate who does not take
, he tint to go into the circumstances
and conditions of each case; in order
to do no must listen to the various
People- Interested hear their versions
of the matters at issue, learn the var-
work of the juvenile court and Moth
er's Pensions; it will be manifest that
this last matter will take time for
careful investigation and consider
ation in order that the Mother's Pen
sion Fund shall be wisely handled
and the money so distributed that it
shall do the maximum amount of good
and that none who are in need, whom
thia fund might help, shall be neglect
ed: while in the Juvenile Court, the
judge has no precedents to follow,
there are no definite rules of action
laid down for the guidance of the
judge in dealing with dependent or
delinquent children; each case pre
sents a different question or combina
tion of questions to be dealt with,
much, in fact all in regard to the child
is left to the discretion of the court,
which most instances 'must take the
place of the parents and become re-
hiponsible for the mental and moral
development of the children who come
into the Jurisdiction of this court.
Here again it will be readily seen
the best service to the public cannot
be given unless the Judge of this
court has ample time for careful in
vestigation and consideration.
In the court of Common Pleas un
der the new arrangement which gives
Fulton county a resident Judge there
has been a marked improvement in
the promptness with which cases in
this court have been disposed of and
the present Judge has been busy all
the time. There are many cases that
are coming up continually, which for
one cause or another the resident
judge may not legally act upon; this
makes necessary the calling in of a
judge from another county to sit in
the case. But the resident judge in
such cases' must gfve his services
in exchange and consequently must be
free to go when he is called to go and
sit in the place of some other judge.
There might be added to the fore
going further details of the work of
these courts, but enough to show how
the element of time enters in to the
question and to show that it would be a
physical impossibility for one judge to
give the best service or even to give
fairly adequate attention to each of
the several departments which would
be included in the combined courts.
The question then arises:7 Is it
good economy to save $800 per year
at the cost of the necessarily limited
and lessened efficiency in service to
the public, which the courts are es
tablished to serve?
We are raising this question not be
cause we have any personal motive
in the matter; we are not nor do we
ever expect to be a candidate for pub
lic office in Fulton county, nor do we
hold a brief for any one who is.
This seems to us a question which
touches the common good and from
our point of view it would be a mistake
to merge the two courts andpoor po
licy even to agitate the matter of
bringing the question before the elec
tors in November.

The boys and girls of the county
mean to make the Fulton County Fair
which is to be held the week of Sep
tember 4th, the best in its history,
educationally speaking.
Governor Willis has iust notified
the committee in charge definitely

pupil from the Fifth District who
makes the best showing at the State

April 7th is Arbor Day for the
schools. One school visited by the
County Superintendent a few days
ago had made a good beginning by
cutting down an undesirable tree on
the school ground, cutting it into
wood, splitting it and piling it in the
wood shed.
An effort is being made by the
teachers of the county to make Arbor
Day mean much to the boys and girl 3
in the way of an added love and ap
preciation for the birds and for na
ture in general round about them.
The boys and girl's club specialist
from the State University will be in
our county the week of April 10 to
14 to help in organizing the work here

the boys and girls in the various
home activities that are to be carried
on in connection with the stock Judg
ing contest at the County Fair next
fall.
May schools have their corn testers
made and are ready to make the tests
of seed corn for the the people of
their community. Men who know, say
that this will be one of the most try
ing seasons in years to get good seed
corn.. The boys and girls can be of
great service m this particular, if
the farmers will only take up tlw
matter with them. Get in your re
auest soon, so your school can plan
to have your seed tested for you in
good time. The boys will have an ad
ded interest in the field of corn the
seed for which he has tested.
The seventh and eigth grade ex
amination will be held April 17th and
18th. The questions will be sent out
from the County Superintendent's of
fice. The next teachers' examination will
be held April 1st.. ' At the last er

year and two temporary certificates
were granted and one two-year re
newal was made. All teachers who
are planning to finish the examination
April 1st, should be sure and have
their practice teaching test by that
time.
The First of a Series of- Articles Writt.n Specially For The Tribune
By Earl M. Wood
Those who are now laying the cause
of the war to Germany's desire to con
trol Europe might be referred to the
pages of history where little more
than one hundred years ago, Napo
leon Bonaparte, ruler of France de
clared war on Prussia and the French
troops poured into that German state
to satisfy the ambitions of their em
peror. The King of Saxony made haste to
come to the aid of King William and
Queen Louise of Prussia, and the al
lied Prussian and Saxon armies met
the French at Jena, where they were
completely routed. The King of Sax
ony at once forsook the Prussian al
liance and arraigned himself on the
side of Napoleon where he remained
until Prussia received the final . blow
at Friedland.
-The Prussians, finding that the
Saxons had deserted them sought the
aid of Russia and in response, Alex
ander, Czar and autocrat of all the
Russians, marched to their relief at
the head of a mighty Muscovite army.
The King, the Queen and the Czar
now agreed to stand or to fall together
and never to make peace- with Napo
leon until he had been driven beyond
the Rhine.
The armies of the Allies and of
France clashed at Friedland. and the
Muscovites and Teutons were com
pelled to withdraw and leave the field
to the victorious French. At once,
the 'defeated rulers hoisted the white
flag, in spite of the entreaties of the
Queen. "For God's Sake, no shame
ful peace", and Alexander became the
staunch friend and ally of Napoleon.
The terms of peace were arranged be.
tween the emperor and the czar with
the king as a mere looker-on. Napo
leon and Alexander met on a raft at
Tilsit in the middle of the River Nie-
men, so to be sure to be on neutral
territory, and there in the sight of
two armies, the emperor of the west
and the emperor of the east divided
up the earth between them at the ex
pense of fallen Prussia and a few
other weakened countries of the continent.
For the desertion of the Prussian al
liance. Russia received a small strip
of land from her former ally, and a
promise to let her take Finland from
the Swedes. Alexander wanted Con
stantinople, but this. Naooleon would
not grant, for he said, "Whoever holds
Constantinople rules the world."
Saxony came in for her share of the
honors when a slice of Prussian terri-

and Napoleon took away more Prus
sian land when he added it to Jerome
Bonaparte's new Kingdom of West
phalia. In addition to these grind
ing terms, the French Emperor order
ed that Prussia should maintain only
a very small standing army, and he
imposed a staggering fine on the con
quered country and ordered that Ber
lin, and all other great Prussian fort
resses should remain in pawn, occupi
ed by French troops .until the fine
was paid.
Queen Louise came to beg that the
emperor spare the Province of Mag
deburg to the weakened nation. But
Napoleon skillfully evaded all her en
treaties, remarking that "the pro
vince of Magdeburg is .worth a dozen
queens of Prussia" and when he told
King William, "I do not mean for
Prussia ever again to be a European
power," she lost all hope. When the
queen went to Memel for the winter
