A full company was present
when Captain Roach commanded
attention and notified the com

posted on the bulletin board
The drill of foot movements
and exercises was confined to the

to the front rapidly in the foot

cluded in the weekly drills The
SafFord company is ambitious to
lead every other company in the

American Punitive Expedi
tion May Be In a Peril
ous Position
NO REPORT FROM PERSHING
Carranza Troops Are Said To Be
Mobilizing at Agua Prietn
Opposite Douglas
The news from Mexico regard
ing the outcome of the American
punitive expedition for the cap
ture of Villa is the cause of grave
concern at Washington
General Funston has wired the
War Department that 2000 Car
ranza troops under command of
General Herrera had revolted and
gone over to Villa Herreras
desertion to Villa may result in
other Carranza troops following
their example and bring about a
serious situation for the United
States and the defacto govern
ment
Reports have also been received
stating that the garrisons at Tor
reon and Cabullona Sonora have
revolted and declared themselves
for Villa It has also been re
ported that the Villa soldiers who
recently surrendered to the Car
ranza commanders at Juarez
Chihuahua Villa Ahumada and
other points numbering 5000
have renounced Carranza and are
on their way to join Villa
It is also reported that the Car
ranza troops under command of
Colonel Cano at Namiquipa who
were supposed to be supporting
the American expedition against
Villa had also gone over to Vlla
Colonel Canos comma d num
bered 900 If this is tiue Jie
American troops under Geneial
Pershing are in a serious posi
tion and may be surrounded
It is evident that Villa intends
attacking the American forces
sent into Mexico to capture him
During his retreat southward he
informed all Mexican residents
of the hamlets through which he
passed that he was saving all
his bullets for the Americans and
would not shoot another Mexican
or allow any of his men to do so
If Villa succeeds in gathering to
gether all his men he will have
approximately 10000 well sea
soned fighting men to attack the
American expeditionary column
The Carranza troops that have
gone over to Villa are all well
armed and mounted They were
recently supplied with thousands
of rounds of ammunition guns
and given good mounts Villa
will have one of the best equipped
fighting forces he has ever com
manded
No report from General Persh
ing has been received by General
Funston for four days and he has
no knowledge of any develop
ments south of Casas Grandes
General Funston has warned
General Pershing of the reported
activities of General Herrera and
the receipt of the message was
acknowledged at Casas Grandes
but no report has been received
Reports from Douglas state
that approximately 2000 Car
ranza troops had been observed
entering Agua Prieta which has
caused grave apprehension at
that place General Calles the
military governor of Sonora
stated no troops had arrived but
asserted that part of the garrison
had been sent to Cabullona 18
miles south
The apparent inactivity of the
militarypatrolling Douglas caused
uneasiness in the civilian circles
but it was currently reported
that the United States troops
were under orders to make no
move which would serve to indi
cate to the defacto forces the
slightest apprehension here
Many citizens credit the report
that Calles is assembling a large
force at Cabullona which Calles
denies and said it was merely a
small camp
lhe citizens addressed to the
Arizona congressional representa
tives suggesting that War De
partment officials be urged to
issue orders to troops stationed
here to enable tlfem to adequate
ly patrol Douglas and afford pro
tection to civilians
A press report from El Paso
Texas states that Villa held up a
train at Moctezuma 85 mijes
northeast of Namiquipa Villa is
said to have walked through the
train threatening death to any
American as he was not fighting
Mexicans except Carranza
