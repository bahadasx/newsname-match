Jolts for the Qovernor.
Putting aside any element of par
tisanship, and telling the plain truth
it must be admitted that the ad
ministration has received a number
of very severe jolts in the Legislature
the past week.
Jolt No. 1 came when the John
son-Yawn bill, providing for a con
stitutional convention, was over
whelmingly defeated. This was a
pet measure of the administration,
yet it received only ten votes in the
Senate. -
Jolt No. 2 occurred when the Sen
ate refused to ratify the conference
committee report on the general ap
propriation bill unless a clause is
inserted to pay the amount due to
Judge Robert Powell. Supreme Court
Reporter.
Jolt No. .' came in the form of a
refusal of the House committee on
ways and means to ratify the pro
posed $1,300,000 bond issue" urged
by the Governor.
- JoU5fo:4wi? i ol'tlie
Senate in increasing the State tax
levy from six to seven mills.
According to current rumors, some
more jolts are being arranged for the
entertainment of the Governor. At
least one effort will be made to pass
a bill over his veto, and in event of
his veto of any of the appropriation
bills it is certain that stiff rights will
be made to enact these measures
without his approval. Jackson Dai

Lessons in Political Economy.
as a result oi various learned in
quiries it is now pretty conclusively
established that the present jump in j
the price of gasoline is due to the
cutting off of the European market,
which has comppelled a certain Dis-
integrated Monopoly to raise at home
the necessary revenues with which
to pay interest and dividends on its
watered stocks and bonds.
Thus, Dear Students, do we per
ceive, under the benevolent system
of Private Ownership of Public Ne
cessities, the perfect operation of the
time-honored law of Demand and
Supply in determining Price.

We thank Senator James K. Var-

can always be located and relied

his views. All admit that he is
