BOOZE BUSINESS
NOW PICKING UP
There was a great deal doing this
week in the liquor business in Judge
J. 0. Harrington's court. The grand
melange started oft with the arrest of
Wm. Rowe for burglary on the com
plaint of Margaret Bradley, a resi
dent of the redlight district. An in
vestigation was made of the case by
the authorities but there was 'no
evidence to show that he was guilty.
This undue notoriety deeply offend
ed the dignity of Mr. Rowe and as
soon as he was cleared of his trouble,
he proceeded to swear out warrants
for Bertha Grenburg, Dean Darling
and Fay Dalton for selling liquor, an
act, which, if proven, has been de
clared diametrically opposite to the
law.
In the case of Bertha Grecnburg
she was held by Judge Harrington
under $300 bonds for trial in the su
perior court.
The cases of Dean Darling and Fay
Dalton were continued to March 30th
under $200 bonds each.
Jim McCann, who is designated by
some as the mayor of the southside,
was arrested charged with selling
liquor to Wm. Rowe and Fred John
son. Mayor McCann's bail was fixed
at $300, but in default has been
boarding with Bill Dickinson.
In the Greenburg case the evidence
was considerably conflicting, not to
say, confusing. The woman claimed
she sold ginger ale charging $1.00 for
two drinks. (Probably very extra
ginger ale.) Rowe swore it was plain
whiskey. Fred Johnson, a native of
Sweden and a log gatherer, was very
vehement in his statement that it was
"dope, dope, dope." When asked for
his definition of "dope" said: "It bain
snuff, tobacco und yingerhell."
SENATOR HUBBELL PREDICTS
BIG REPUBLICAN VICTORY
Senator J. Lorenzo Hubbell stopped
off here Wednesday morning on his
way home from Phoenix where he had
been attending the meeting of the re
publican state centrahcommittee. The
senator is well pleased with "love
feast" and enthusiastically avers that
the state and national republican
tickets will be elected this fall. There
is a republican landslide coming and
it is plainly visible to the naked eye.
Senator Hubbell left in the afternoon
for his home in Ganada.

G. Ewing, foreman of one of the
grading gangs during the strenuous
days thirty-five years ago, when the
A. & P. railroad was being put
through this country, was in Flagstaff
Monday. Mr. Ewing has lived in
Washington and California since that
time, but has concluded to return to
Flagstaff if he concludes his business
arrangements successfully. He was
hunting for old friends of that period
but found few except, Joe Ferrell, who
could go into details with him about
old times. .
Flagstaff Will Celebrate .
Flagstaff Lodge No. 499, B. P.
Elks, is going to handle the Fourth i
of July celebration in Flagstaff this
year. They have not completed an
their arrangements or made up a
program but from the plan on paper
it looks as though Flagstaff will have.

one of the most patriotic orders in
the country and it is fitting that they
should take charge of the celebration
of our nation's birthday.
Origin of the Grand Canyon
S. D. Pepin, the geologist, has
written a neat little book entitled
"Origin of Grand Canyon" which con
tains many interesting details of that
wonderful gorge, including many
photos of points of interest. The book
is handsomely gotten up and shows
throughout its pages that Geologist
Pepin is a deep student in his line of
work. He is also author of "The
Legend of the Bright Angel Trail,"
"The Rim Road Drive" and other de
scriptive matter of the Canyon.

in there 'is about three feet of snow

Flagstaff. The snow is melting rapid-
ly.
EXPLOSION OF ENGINE
CAUSES DEATH OF THREE
Friday evening engine 959 blew up
at Manuelito, 14 miles this side of
Gallup, killing Engineer I.. Snowgren,
Fireman Childs and Brakeman Rig
gins. The time of the accident was
4:10 p. m. as both the engineer and
fireman's watches stopped at that
time. The men were blown a great
.distance and the boiler was clear -off
the right of way.
No cause for the accident has been
found, and may never be, as the en
gine is a total wreck and all con
cerned are dead. Riggins was mar
ried and leaves a wife and child, the
other two being unmarried. Fireman
Childs was a Flagstaff boy and had
been working out of Winslow for the
past six months. His father, S. M.
Childs, left for Winslow Saturday to
take charge of the remains.
Fireman Childs was buried at his
old home In Colorado. Engineer
Snowgren was taken to Michigan for
burial and Brakeman Riggins to Mis
souri. The accident is a complete mystery
to other railroad men, as those killed
in the accident were competent men
and all seemed right with the engine
when it left for the run.
A NOON HOUR LECTURE
ON "TOWN TEAM-WORK
A great opportunity is awaiting the
business men and citizens of Flagstaff
in the coming of Thomas Brooks
Fletcher, lecturer and newspaper edit
or, who is the lost number on the N.
A. N. S. entertainment course.
Air. Fletcher lectures at Emerson
hall, Saturday evening, March 25th;
his subject being ''Martyrdom of
Fools." Mr. Fletcher writes that in
addition to the above, he .desires to
address the school chilldrcn, and busi
ness men and women of Flagstaff at
the noon hour on "Town Team Work."
, The latter address is to be without
charge. This is a rather unusual of

! states that his sole motive in doing so
is to help every community in which
he enters to better unity. All he asks
is that the women be included, and
that clerks of the city be invited. In
his talk he will .discuss salesmanship,

Promised to Capture Villa
Jesus MaTorrcs, a Mexican, stirred
up some sentiment Tuesday by post
ing a notice written in Spanish in the
postoffice. It was torn down imme
diately, but no one was able to read
it undcrstandingly. Some feared it
was a Mexican uprising notice, but
when properly deciphered read: "Jesus
MaTorres promises to get Doroteo
Arango alias Francisco Villa."
Of course there was no objection to
this, in fact every one who read it
agreed that he could have Villa if
he caught him.
FUOSTAFF HONORED BY
GRAND niC RODIES
It is seldom that one city is honored
by two of the highest officers in the
grand lodge masonic bodies ns Flag
staff is this year, but by reason of
ability and promotion in order we
have been signally honored in the
election of Dr. E. S. Miller as grand
high priest of the Royal Arch Masonic
body at Tucson last week. Dr. Miller
is one of the best known masons in
the state having previously served as
grand master of the blue lodges of the
state with distinction.
Judge F. W. Perkins of this city
was elected Grand Master of the
Master Masons lodge, having pre
viously held second to the highest
office during the past year.
That both will serve with distinc
tion and ability during the coming
year is undoubted by the members of
the Masonic order throughout the
state.
COMPANY I ORDERED TO RECRUIT
TO FULL WAR STRENGTH FOR SERVICE
State Troops Ordered to Be Ready for Active Duty By
Adjutant General If 50,000 Men are Called
Arizona Will Furnish Her Quota.
The following telegram was received late last night by
Captain E. M. Robison of Company I from Adjutant General
Harris:
"You will immediately recruit your company to war
strength over 65 men. Use form under seventeen instruc
tions for mobilization and these men will be discharged if not
taken into active service. The men enlisted for war service
must commence training at once. You will hold drills each
night until further orders. Note on finlistment papers 'to be
discharged if not called into Federal service.'"
The above telegram would indicate that' the 50,000 men
would be called for by the United States to handle the Mex
ican situation and the Guard of Arizona is putting itself into
shape to help meet the "call the moment it comes.
Company I should be recruited up to 100 men in a very
short time.
PUNS' TO HAVE SUGGESTED
PATRIOTIC-WEEK IN FLAG
Last week, the editor of the Coco
nino Sun, commenting on Baby Week,
suggested that, along with all the
rest of the special days and weeks we
are so busily celebrating, it would not
be a bad plan to have a Patriotic
Week.
"That's about the most sensible idea
I've seen in a newspaper for about the
last one hundred years," and Dr.
Hambly, the live-wire minister at the
Federated church, in his sermon Sun
day night, as he called people's atten
tion to this pertinent patriotic week in
Flagstaff. "
Why not? There is no reason in
the world why not, and every possible
reason why we should. Suppose we
at (umc juob uiic ween in i-iagaiuu
when every mother's son of us puts
himself to a thoughtful, active con
sideration of the problem of studying
ing into the minds of every man,
woman and child lessons in true love
of country. There was never need
more apparent than for national pa
triotic rejuvenation right now.
?nt nrrwlA ...nt n.. mnnl, Tf P '
Bombs! Demolished manufactories!
Destroyed steamships! Burning car
goes! Burning churches! Blown-up
postoffice buildings! Rebelling Mexi
cans! Soap-box orators preaching
anarchy, and bitterness, and hatred,
on every street corner! Cordons of
guards about industrial plants in time
of peace! these are some of the pre-;
sent fruits of the cheat and impostor
that has masqueraded up to this time ,
under the name of American patrio
tism, until we arc brought to the
stern and solemn realization that of.
all the possible enemies America may
have in the whole wide world today,
her greatest and deadliest foe resides
within her own borders in the masses
of her unworthy, unpatriotic aliens
who name her name with an inward
sneer, neither loving her flag, nor
revering the principles for which she ,
stands. Let us be deceived no longer.
The great world war has taught us
with unmistakable emphasis that
America has ceased to Americanize '
the strangers within her gates; that
it is a positive danger for us to look I
longer with complacency upon bogus
American citizens who speak an alien
tongue and cling to the traditions of j
an alien land; that instant steps ,
should be taken to counteract the in
fluence of this newly discovered men
ace. Let us have new immigration laws!
Yes, but let us at the same time ad-J
dress ourselves to the task of self
preservation by Americanizing the
foreigners now in our midst. Let us
make loyalty to flag in this country
second only to loyalty to our God.
Yes, indeed, let us have a Patriotic
Week in Flagstaff. Begun here, we
predict that the movement would soon
extend itself to the remotest corner of
our land, and work for untold good to
posterity and civilization.
A CITIZEN.
C. B. Nicolls, the Standard Oil man
was in Holbrook Thursday. The re
port that he was taking a short vaca
tion from Flagstaff on account of its
being leap year, is exaggerated. Of
course he is popular as an entertainer,
etc., etc., but aside from that the re
port comes from pure jealousy.

he will have to wander along some.

May Be a Supervisoral Candidate
Ed I. Hamilton, of Williams, who
was in the city this week has been
prominently mentioned among the
.democratic brethren as a possible
candidate for supervisor this fall. Ed
is well known and popular in the west
end aside from having many old time
friends in this section of the country.
FOUR NEWSPAPERS NOW
PRINTFM FLAGSTAFF
Flagstaff is not behind in any pre
ciptable way in the publication line
and we will soon have four newspapers
when the newest democratic weekly
is printed.
The newest paper to come up for
the aproval of the public, is the
"Empress Theatre Weekly" published
by J. J. Costigan. It is a live little
weekly containing all the movie news
and many local advertisements and
other matter of interest to the public,
published every Monday.
The Pine, published by the Normal
is a thriving publication covering all
the things of interest doing at the big
Normal school, including a special car
toonist on the staff, who sees that all
important events are properly depict
ed. Then there is Sam Finley's Store
News, with Sam as the chief anarchist
to perpitrate things on the public
when "pep" stirs the muse and fur
nishes the news.
Also ran, is The Coconino Sun that
proposes to beam and shine regardless
of all murky weather. But neverthe
less, it is a remarkably good showing
in the publicity line for one place the
size of Flagstaff, and we are proud
of the achievement. The more we
advertise the quicker results are produced.
FIRST IRISH POTATOES
FOUND AT FLAGSTAFF
According to a news dispatch, C. ,11.
Wolfe represented as the "well known
Greeley authority," now concedes the
fact, that what is known as the Irish
potato, is not Irish at all, but that its
original habitat was in south America.
When a boy at school we were taught
that Sir Walter Raleigh obtained spe
cimens of this tuber which were
found in South America and carried
them across the water where they
were cultivated by the Irish people
and thence returned to the colonies.
In the year 1882, when Prof. Lemon,
a celebrated American botanist, was
"snooping"around the San Francisco
mountains, in Arizona, near where the
town of Flagstaff now stands, but
which then consisted only of a rail
road contractor's camp and a stock
ranch near by owned by a son of
Brigham Young, and discovered the
potato in its native state, indigenous
to that section it only confirmed what
had already been instilled into our
young mind.
I Now since the "well known author
' ity of Greeley" puts his stamp of ap
I proval, on what has never been de
i nied, since Sir Walter took the first
I specimen across the ocean, we are
I ready to believe it unqualifiedly and
without the introductoin of further
evidence. Phoenix Gazette.
Just as further evidence that this is
the native birth place of the potato,
; our old time friend Mike Clancy, who
has a ranch around east of Elden
Mountain, brought in a number of
small potatoes that he found growinf
wild on the mountain side in places
that never had been cultivated. In
view of the evidence presented by
scientists as well as our friend Clan
cey we are willing to concede that
Flagstaff was the original and first
home of the potato. As more evidence
the very best potatoes in the world
are raised here. '
MEXICAN PLOTTERS ARE
'ARRESTED AT JEROME
Alleged to be the ringleaders in a
plot to foment a Mexican uprising,
two Mexicans were arrested Monday
at Jerome, Arizona, and placed in the
county jail at Prescott pending an in
vestigation. Sheriff W. Young went to Jerome
and swore in fifty deputies to preserve
order, following the receipt of advices
concerning the alleged uprising. He
stated that an investigation revealed
that the Mexicans at Jerome had pur
chased all the arms and ammunition
in the town.
Arrest of the alleged ringleaders,
Sheriff Young believed, would prevent
the possibility of trouble. The mine
and smelter of the United Verde Cop
per company are located at Jerome.
Mr. A. C. Ringland, former district
forester at Albuquerque, was in Flag
staff last week Friday on his way to
San Francisco where he has been
transferred. It is understood that Mr.
Ringland is working up a new and
important branch of the service re
cently inagurated with headquarters
at San Francisco.
BUSY WEEK IN THE
T
This was one of the busy weeks in
the Superior court and many cases
were lifted from the docket by legal
process.
In the case of the state vs. W. E.
Morgan and Hanford Scott charged
with having killed cattle on the range
not belonging to them, both defend
ants were discharged without a trial.
The Bozeman-Sharkey cose in
wj Ich they were tried jointly was the
mi st hotly contested case of the week.
One witness swore that he had
squeezed whiskey out of snow where
a broken bottle in the trunk leaked
and that it made a fairly good drink.
The jury went out Tuesday at 11
o'clock and did not return until 9:30
Wednesday morning. Bozeman was
acquitted of the charge against him
and the jury refused to agree on a
verdict in the Starkey end of the case.
The case will go over until the next
term.
Tom Owens of Williams, who was
charged with fracturing the prohibi
tion amendment to the constitution,
asked through his attorney, X. N.
Steeves for a change of Judges alleg
ing prejudice, and Judge Sapp .of'
Winslow was called in from Navajo
county. The case was postponed until
this morning and will be tried before
Judge Sapp.
Ike Moses trial for having intro
duced a couple kegs of whiskey into
the state in a trunk was heard Wed
nesday. It appears that the trunk
was shipped in the name of Mrs.
Schwalbe under the assumed name of
personal effects. When the trunk was
captured and Moses arrested, he ad
mitted that the liquor was for his own
personal use also some for a friend.
The "friend" clause of his statement
seemed conclusive evidence to the jury
that he had given the law a black eye
and in a short time after hearing the
evidence, they brought in a verdict of
guilty.
Moses will receive sentence tomor
row morning.
Clarence Goins pled guilty to the
charge of stealing the team of horses
from the Greenlaw logging camp and
will receive his sentence tomorrow.
State vs. Willis and Henry Azbill,
charged with murder. Cause continued
till next jury session.
State vs. Louis Torrez. Assault
Defendant entered a plea of guilty,
fined $180.00, and in default commit
ted to jail until fine paid at the rate
of not less than $1.00 per day for each
day's' imprisonment
Babbitt-Poison Company vs. George
McCormick. Default entered.
Iva R. Owen vs. Harold M. Owen.
Dismissed on motion of plaintiff.
Fred Hensing vs. C. C. Thornton.
By agreement continued until next
jury session.
The Columbia Company vs. J. E.
Buckley, Jr. Dismissed on motion of
plaintiff.
