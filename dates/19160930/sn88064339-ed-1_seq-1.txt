OF NEALY
The True e mocrat has had for
sereral years past a non-resident sub
scriber, Mr. Heauregard Barrow of Hot
8prings, Ark, who has told us that
seine day he expects to buy a honme in
West i'eliciana. The natural query
was if he were related to the Harrows
of Iluislana. We taae the liberty of
publishing his answer because it not
only s ill interest the large Harrow
connecrtion in this and other parts ,of
Louisiana., but it will furnish family
daita ill ('IcollVeniieIt form for preser\a
tion. as so many of that name or bho.d
are subacribers to this paper.
Our lipt Springs reader writes:
"Int a former letter you asked ni. it
I po.re connected with or related to the
Louisiana lNarrows. I can only say 'No,'
and then again 'Yes,' and will state the
'onttectlion My great great grand

1816. They were first pousins of my
ireat grandfather and lived coteo

William Harrow was born in 1766, died
in 1828; Bartholomew Darrow was born

leaving five' mwnI to carry on that

"Now, my great grandmother's name

reasonable to think that the Wylie
