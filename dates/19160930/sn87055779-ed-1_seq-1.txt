HUGHES' PROTEST
Chairman M'Cormick Says
Statement Shows Utter
Lack of Frankness,
.fw-Tiuic Sj.eciU S-rvi.e:
Ni:V YORK. Sept. I'.O. Vance
r. McCormick. chairman of the
democratic national committee, to
day gave- out the following state
ment: "Mr. Hughes' attempt to explain
his silence, when a word from him
would have been welcomed, con-
(crnin"4 means for averting the
threatened railroad strike, stamps
hirn with an utter lack of frankness.
lie did not sugst to his republican
ailvispi s in the senate that they n&ht
to the last ditch the law that he
now assails because, as he says, he
does not l.elieve in filibuster inf .
"lie protests, also that the ad
ministration, through the legislative
channels of congress. met the
crii with such business-like dis
patch that he. a, thousand miles re
moved, could not have een ex
pected to offer any suggestions.
'The protest of the republican
cruididalo that if mnuress, through
Its majority, determined to pass the
bill there was no reason whatever
that its action should he merely
delayed by fdibusterinpr is illumin
ating, as ileveK pint: another of Mr.
llu-jhes Inconsistencies. Just about
the time the senate was confront
ed with the strike crisis, the demo
crats, in obedience to the mandates
of their party platform, were try
ing to pass through the senate the
corrupt practices act. which seeks
to curb an evil that is a disgrace to
tlie nation.
When by a vote of more than
two to one. the senate voted to pro
ceed oh the consideration of this
bill which already had been passed
by the house ami favorably report
ed by a senate committee, the pas
sage of this meritorius legislation by
the senate was obstructed and de
feated, or as Mr. Huphes would
say, 'merely delayed' by a repub
lican threat of iilibuster. The 'mere
delay" in this instance, was highly
important in view of the pending
presidential election and it is sig
nificant that the republicans were
responsible for the 'mere delay.'
"Mr. Hughes knew that congress,
through its majority h;-.d determined
to pass the bill (the corrunt prac
tices ad) and he knew, moreover
that the manifest desire of the ma
jority of the senate was beim; ob
structed by the republican threat of
a tihbuster. a legislative device in
which the leader of the republican
party 'Poes not believe.'
"A word from Mr. Huches dur-im-T
the pendency of this bill would
have sutticed to have stopped the
filibuster and enabled the majority
o pass the corrupt practices act.
But no word came from Mr. Hughes.
He was as silent about the threat
ened filibuster against the corrupt
practices act as he is now Matant
In offering his objection to filibuster
ing as his excuse for not defeating
the eight hour law.
"If be remained silent on the
eight hour law because h does not
l.elieve in lilibu.terintr. why didn't
he speak out and condemn the
threatened filibuster by which the
corrupt practice act was defeated."

SAYS LONDON
British Papers Regard Chan
cellor's Speech as Admis
sion That Germany
Sees Defeat Ahead.'
BELIEVE SUBS WILL BE
CALLED TO ACTION SOON
Washington Officials Are Not
Worried Say Time is
Not "Proper" to Start
Sub Warfare.
Interactional News Service
LONDON, Sept. SO. The speech
of Pr. von Bethmwin-Hollweg, the
Herman chancellor, is regarded here
as an admission that Uermany sees
defeat to be inevitable. Dr. von
j Bethmann-Hollweg's, words imply
ing that ruthless submarine war
faiP is to be resumed is taken to
clinch that belief.
Germany ha,s held her submarine
licet as the linal weapon to be
launched when a.11 else failed, and,
despite the boast that the German
lins will hold the chancellor's ref
erence to submarines show that
fear has begun to eat into the heart
of the (Jerman government, in the
minds of English leaders.
Such responsible newspapers as
the Times and the Chronicle, in
analyzing the reichstag speech see
in it a reflection of official pessim
ism. The Chronicle declares that Ger
many sees all hope of annexing
Belgium gone and that she realizes
that she cannot win on tho field.
The only question, the Chronicle
says is:
"How much longer can flerrnany
last ."
Newspapers and government of
ficials express no exaggerated hopes.
They said that Oermany will fipht
on and that it may he many months
before the end is near, but all cur
rent developments, of which tho
chancellor's speech is one of the
most important, point more. and
more clearly to decisive victory for
the allies, it is declared.
TI.Mi; NOT P.UOPFJt.
International Newü St ice :
WASHINGTON, Sept. .10. Diplo
matic circles in Washington today
failed to see indications that Ger
many would resume submarine war
fare on the former plane "at this
time."
Chancellor von Dethmann-Holl-weg's
characterization of a states
man who deserves "to be handed"
referred to a statesman who would
refrain from tisin every "proper"
means of warfare," one diplomat
stated. "It is not "proper' 'or her
own interest."
The return to the United States of
Ambassador Gerard from Germany
likewise was taken a. an indication
that no change is to come in the
German policy.
It is ad nit ted that the ä.rrlass-
ndor will discuss relations between 1
Germany and the United States with
Sec'y of State Imsig and with
Pres't Wilson, but it is denied that
his coming has any great signifi
cance. State department officials
said today that Ambassador Gerard
would also tai!-: or the possibility of
peace in Europe when he arrives in
Washington, but that his discus
sion.? will not result in any change
iu the situation at the present time.
