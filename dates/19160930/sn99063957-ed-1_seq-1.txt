, New York, Sept. 30. .T. P. Morgan
was booked to sail for England on the
American liner New York at noon to
day to float a new quarter of a bil
lion dollar British war loan, according
to reports m financial circles here. Hen
ry P. Davidson, Morgan's partner, has
been in Knglnnd for several weeks, pre
sumably arranging 'details of the loan
which is to be secured by collateral
consisting mainly of American securi
ties. The new loan, if floated, will come
is a climax to three weeks of bull Ac
tivities on the Mew York stock ex
chnnge, started, according to the ac
cepted belief of Wall street in order
to develop a sentiment of optimism and
prosperity among investors such as
would facilitate placing the new llrit
ish bonds. "
Twenty consecutive million share
days on the stock exchange have sent
prices to new high levels! Bond buy

of the supply of high grade securities

in Standard Oil subsidiaries have, it is
estimated, made John D. Rockefeller
the world 's first billionaire.
(iainB in Standard Oil stocks yester
day according to estimates made to
day added $32,000,000 to the aggregate
value of the Standard Oil securities.
John D. Rockefeller's share of this in
crease was estimated at $8,02Jl,000.
While brokers on the streets, were
betting todny that the run of million
share days would exceed the straight
victory a'ring of tho New York Ginnts
before the bull movement eomee to a
halt, figures on United States Steel
showed that the common stock of the
big corporation had increased in val
uation ,r,00,000 in a single day. At
the record high of 120 5-8 the five mil
lion shares of United States Steel com

BATILEjREEK TODAY
8ig Crowds Greet Him He
Announces He Will Make
a Fighting Speech
By J. P. Yoder.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Battle Creek, Mich., Sept. 30. Re
publicanism 'a reserve artillery was op
ened here in behalf of t'harles E.
Hughes by Theodore Roosevelt this aft
ernoon, It wjs the ex-president 's chief po
litical address of the campaign. In it
he excoriated President Wilson's Eu
ropean and Mexican policies as avoid
ing public duty "by adroit elocution
and by the simple policy of drugging
our sonts with tho narcotic of meaniuir-
1 less phrase mongering, "in which"
tries fi u e wonts have had the meaning
taken, - '
Mexican Situation.
Roosevelt devoted more than a third
of his speech to decrying the stand tak
en by the president in the German con
troversy and in the Mexican situation.
He 'followed with denunciation of the
administration's attitude on prepared
ness. During the Inst half he went
deeply into detail in criticising the
manner in which President YVilssu
averted the nation-wide railroad strike.
"At the outset," suid Roosevelt"I
wish to say a word as to protests made
by so many people that we must not
criticise the president. I did 'stand by
the president' for a year nd a half.
It was with deep reluctance, however,
that I was forced to the conclusion that
to do so longer was incompatible with
standing by the interests of mankind
and the honor of this nation.
"I am convinced the conscience of
this people has been seared and its
moral -sense dulled by the leadership
of the administration and congress dur
ing the last three years.
Opposes Peace at Any Price.
"Mr. Wilson's supporters say we
should vote for him tor keeping us out
of war. It is worth while to remember
this could not have been said in behalf
of George Washington or Abiiihum Lin
coln. These men spurned the tories and
copH-Thcads with contemptuous indigna
tion as feeble and cowardly folk for
urging penceui-anyprice. "
Roosevelt recited in detail the various
unwarned sinkings by submarines of
liners with Americans abunrd. ' 11c re
fers to the l.usituiiin attack as the
"most colossal single instance oT the
minder of uon-.combntnuts, including
men, women mid children that has been
perpetrated by any power cnlling itself
civilized for over a century."
He declared the president "had full
notice as lo what was to be done" and
that he erred in not taking action that
would have stopped it.
"And after it," said Roosevelt, his
teeth flashing in the old wny, niul bis
voice raised to high falsetto, "he ouly
spoke. Ho said something about being
too proud to fight. Imagine George
Washington saying that after the bat
tle of Lexington or Lincoln mnking such
n statement after Sumtr vns fired
on."
Wilson is Vacillating.
Roosevelt declured the president was
vacillating and reversed himself "even
when he did finally act." "He said the
administration refused to recognize Hu
erta because "his title was based on
intrigue and assassination," but that
Colonel Benavides , was recognized as
president of Peru, "although Benuvides
imprisoned the president aud assassinat
ed the minister of war and various oth
ers..' '
The former president said recognition
of Carranza "was the acid test in view
of the indictment of Cnrranza by the
president's own secretary of state, Mr.
LauBing. "He called the present Mexican-American
negotiations "humiliat
ing and disgraceful." He said America
has "earned the derision of mankiud
by our policy of mixed bluster, hypoc
risy and unpreparedness. "
Lusitania Murder.
"Mr. Wilson speaks loftily on be

Forty-five villuges, each one organ
ized into a veritable fortress by the
Teutons, have fallen before the batter
ing of French and British artillery. In

so strong that it.had to be broken down
by shell fire before infantry could storm
it.
A total of 02,000 prisoners, 283 can
non, half of which arc heavy artillery
pieces and more than 1,000 machine
guns have been taken,-
..Everywhere from the Ancrc to a point

rushing through hastily constructed Ger

Bremen has been captured by
the British and is now at the

er Ferth on the const of Scot-
land, aooerding to apparently.

Says: "Such Rhetorical Minis
terial Excursions May
Cost Many Lives"
Loudon, Kept. 3o. The Manchester
Guardian, strong liberal organ, -today
reproved Wur Secretary Lloyd-George
for his statements to the Vnited Press
and took occasion in its editorial crit
cisra to urge a more detailed and con
crete authorized exposition of allied
aims.
The Guardian is the first influential
paper in England to withhold approval
of Lloyd-George's declaration that the
war inusUbe carried to s "knockout"
and that neutrals must not intervene at
this time.
"To reject all conversation with neu
trals is a sign of violence and weak
ness," said the Guardian. "Such rhe
torical ministerial excursions limy cost
many lives. Lloyd-George 's language
apepara hut of passion, rather than in
ducing clearness. We can't agree with
him that time doesn't count in this
wtr, when ther Ua daily roll of from
2.000 to 3,000 dead or wounded." y
The Guardian declared Lloyd-George
should concern himself with only mili
tary affairs, letting the premier and
foreign secretnory conduct the foreign
affuirs of the nation. The newspaper
announced that it 'was not necessary for
Lloyd-George to repudiate offers o'f in
tervention and snub a proposal before it
was made, declaring that there is no
reason why Britain should not be. will
ing at the proper time to listen to sug
gestions and give friendly consideration
to advice from Washington.

BOTH SIDES WHIPPED
IN MEXICAN BATTLE
latest Advices Show Both
Sides Retreated After
' Sharp Skirmish
' By Webb Miller.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, Sept. 30. Paucho
Villa and his forces are encamped at
the properties of the four American
owned mines near Cusihuiriachic, follow
ing Wednesday's battle with de facto
troops, according to the latest reports
received here today.
Carraiuiista authorities claim two vic
tories for de facto troops but details
of Wcdneeduy's fighting received by
United States secret service agents here
indicate that both opposing forces had
retreated and that the battle was with
out result.
Led by Villa himself,, a detachment
o'f BOO Villistas said the report, attack-,
ed "Cuai" Wednesday aud captured
the town with but little bloodshed. Part
of tho garrison revolted and joined the
bandits. ' The others includiufa the of-
' ficers, were given an opportunity to
I join the Villistas and when they refused
were flogged and sent back to tell Gen
ernl Trovino at Chihuahua City that Vil
la had captured the town. The officers
fleeing from "Cusi" carried word to
General Ramos, ouly a few miles dis
tant. He immediately attacked the
town with a force of eight hundred
men. Villa hastily withdrew into the
mouth of a nearby canyon and set a
trnp for tho Carratizistas. As the de
facto forces followed the bandits into
the canyon they were met by a heavy
fire from machine guns and mowed
down. Ramos hurriedly withdrew his
troops from the cnnyon,-rcformed and
marched away to Santa Ysnbel.
Representatives of the American
owned mines hero doubt if Villa will
' molest the properties as from all indi
cations the bandit leader bus apparently
changed his attitude toward Ameri
cans. Villa ig Driven Back.

IN EFFECHOMORROW
California Milk Men Must
Have Cows Tested or Milk
Pasteurized
Sacramento, Oil., Sept. 30. What lr.
Charles Keane, state veterniirian, calls
the "greatest law in California ' be
comes effective tomorrow. It if the
pure milk law, and when it gets work
ing properly will insure the public p.n
absolutely safe inily supply, thus giv
ing protection nguiiist much needless
disease, including occasional disastrous
epidemics.
California is the first state of't'ie
union to enact legislation of this kind.
A number of cities hiive pure m Ik
laws but the Golden stute takes the
lead in putting it on a broad and
sweeping scsle.
"1 predict," said Or. Keane today,
"that when other stntes observe the
good effects of this law they will rapid
ly fall in line with similar legislation.''
The law requires the pasteurization
of all ir.:)!c sold at rernll tor human
consumption, except when the milk Is
from cows free from tuberculosis.
If n dairyman doesn't choose to
have his cows tested, he will be requlr
eu to have the milk pasteurised. How
ever, the great number of applications
show that a big majority of the dairy
men will choose the test. This indi
cates, according to Keane that there
will not be an advance in the price of
milk. Pasteurized milk brings a high
er price but comparatively few dairy
men will choose, pasteurization.
RESULT OF POLICY
HAS BEEN PEACE
T
If This Is Wrong, As Republi
cans Claim, Then They
Want War
IF IN POWER WOULD THEY
REPEAL 8-HOUR LAW?
Tells Critic He "Would Be
Mortified To Be Voted for
By the Disloyal"
Shadow Lawn, K. J.f Sept.- 30.'
Warning that a return to republican
ism means tho country will be drawn
In one form or another to the brink of
war, President Wilson this afternoon
urged all young domocrats and truo
progressives to unite in . maintaining
democratic control.. '
"I can draw no other conclusion,"
he said. ''Our opponents ha)e fouud
fault with our foreign policy. They
have said it is all wrong. It has re-,
suited in peace. Thorefore it appears
they want war. Some members of that
party havo even declared in favor of
war." .
At the same time, ho warned that
"officials of foroign governments will
watch this election carefully."
President Outlines Position.
The Uuited Press is able to outline
authoritatively and in detail on what
basis the president belioves he should
be returned to office.
He holds that-since -the administra
tion of Abraham Lincoln the republican
party has been provincial. It has,
figuratively speaking believed in clos
ing up America anil having a good
tiiue instead. - . . .
Ci the other hand,-, the" dotnoeratie..
party, the president will attempt to
show, has looked outside the bouse in
njiich the United States Is enclosed
has seen there the tremendous world
trade awaiting at our doors and haa
acted to properly meet that market. By
implication, if not by direct interroga
tion, the president may be expected in
his addresses of the next few week's to
ask the republican candidate what he
would do in caso of his election, to
change the foundations already laid
for this trade.
. What Would Hughes Do? ..
The president believes he has estab
lished a policy of International inter
course, any change in which might
prove of vital consequence to the fu
turo peace of the nation. By implica
tion, if not directly, he may be ex
pected soon to question the republican
nominee ns to what changes his party
would ftiuko in the foreign policy.
In the president's opinion, his ad
ministration is an "open book" re
quiring no explanation because it
speaks for itself. He believes, how
ever, that tho people, if they aro asked
to denounce his policies, are entitled to
specific i ii for in ii t i n from Hughes as to
what the republican party would do
should it be placed in power what
would be its definite changes in tha
tariff; what would be its policy toward
Mexico; how would it act in the Mex
ican embrogilo, and what would it dO'
with the Adiim:on eight-hour law.
Can Conditions Be Bettered.
Not what would the republican party
havo done, but what would it, suggest
doing now, is what tho president will
nsk. Until these answers are given
the president may bo expected merely
to explain what he hopes his adminis
trntion may accomplish through its
