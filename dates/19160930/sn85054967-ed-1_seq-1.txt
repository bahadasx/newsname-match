ARMED TANK STARTS FOR
BERLIN DESPITE DRIVER
At The British Front in
France» Sept. 28.—With a lull
prevailing after the two days'
battle which gained five villages
.and in which 5,000 prisoners
were taken, the correspondent
has gleaned from participants
many stories, not only of cour
age and mipulse, but of humor
and paradox, possible only in
such complicated and remorse
less warfare as that of the grand
offensive.
The most wonderful of ali
perhaps was that of one of the
"tanks" or new armored motor
cars which started for Berlin on
its own initiative. This mon
strous landship, ambling and
lumbering along, did not wait
for the infantry after the tak
ing of Gueudecourt, but plod
ded over shell holes and across
lots looking for food like some
pre-historie lizfcrd. Sooner or
later it was bound to find an
other German trench and engagé
the occupants with its machine
guns. In this it succeeded, but
it ran out of gasoline.
ADRIAN MINERS GO ON STRIKE, DEMANDING EIGHT
HOUR WORK DAY
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Sept. 29.—As a result of the strike of
the "outside men" at the Adrian mine of the R. and P. Coal and
Iron Co., the mine is idle today. The tipple men and fìremen are
demanding an eight-hour day at the present wage rate. A con
ferete was held yesterday between James Purcll, distriet U. M.
W. of A. president ; Richard Gilbert, distriet secretary ; W. S. Da
vidson, sub-district president of Indiana eounty; B. M. Clark of
this place, representing the R. and P. Co. ; Rembrandt Peale of St.
Benedict ; H. J. Hinderliter of Clearfield, representing the C. B. C.
C., and several other members of the Operatore' association with
regard to the general situation in this distriet.
FIRE IN STATE CAPITAL
METROPOLITAN ANNEX ALMOST TOTALLY DESTROYED
HARRISBURG, Sept. 28.—Fifty sleeping guests had narro'.v
escapes early today when fire almost destroyed the Metropolitan
Annex on Market Street, formerlv the United States Hotel, own
ed by C. H. Moore, formerly proprietor of tlie Moore Hotel of this
place. Policemen and fìremen ran through the building carrying
out the guests. The damage will amount to several thousand dol

THE PA TRIOT
be supplied with great stores of
arms and munitions by the Al
lied nations. M. Venizelos, for
mer premier and leader of the
pro-Ally party, has become the
man of the hour in Greece. His
prestige ranks with, if it does
not over-shadow that of King
Constantine.
A formai declaration of war
by Greece would make the 15th
nation to enter the world confiict
and the llth to take the field
against the Germanie. allies.
In some quarters belief pre
vails that the Greek government
has been impressed no less by
the growing pro-Ally feeling in
Greece than by the great victor
ies which the Anglo-French arm
ies are winning on the Somme
front. Almost every day now
brings news of fresh progress
in that quarter and of growing
demoralization among the Ger
man ..

Gree.c warsLips have j vned the
Aliiel fle'.t ras been foliowed by
repons OL lurther desertions
from the yrmy and growing
strength of the national defence
araiy of the revolutionists.
When the Germans found this
strange creature, with its im
penetrable steel hide,. stalled,
curiosity and a desire for re
venge was a filip to their cour
age. They went after it with the
stalking evidity of the preistor
ie man after a wounded marn
ino th that .has had his bulk tane
in one of the alleys of Save
Dwellers' row, while they tried
to avert the thrusts of its dead
ly tucks.
NQ such game was ever seen
before on this western front,
which is used to ali kinds of bi
zarre fighting.
According to the account ver
aciously given by officers, while
the tank's machine guns were
blazing right and left and tak
ing heavy toll of life, some Ger
mans managed to creep along
their trenches under the fore
and hind legs of this crushing
beast and then they swarmed
over it looking for an opening
through which they might strike
at its vitals.

Sentences Are Handed To
Illegal Dispensers Of Liquor
Several illegal liquor sellers
found it was a serious offense to

out a license, as the result of
sentences imposed by Judge J.
N. Langham this week. Tom
Pitts of Ernest was sentenced
to pay a fine of SSOO, the costs
and serve six months in the

and S2OO a motion for parole
would be considered.

trial was pending. The court

ed fhe defendant to pay the
costs, a fine of SIOO and serve
nine months in the workhouse.
James Colangelo of Indiana
pleaded guilty to selling liquor
without a license as proprietor
of the Montgomery hotel, and a
heated discussion arose between
District Attorney Liggett and
Attorneys Cunningham and Get
ty, who appealed to the court
for leniency in behalf of the de
ffendant. The district attorney
insisted upon the maximum pen
alty of fine and imprisonment,
alleging the violations were in
open defiance of the law and that
the defendant had approached
varioùs officers with off ers to
"make it right" with them on
condition they "keep stili." He
also stated proof could be offer
ed to show Colangelo under as
sumed authority as the county
detective had exacted tribù te
from proprietors of speakeasies
under threats of prosecutori.
Counsel for Colangelo alleged the
changes were the outeome of
prosecutions he had made in
good faith and revenge on the
part of the district attorney.

The Pittsburgh Railways Com
pany's 10-cent night fare was
declared abolished in a decision
handed down by the Pennsylvan
ia Public Service Commission
yesterday at Harrisburg. The
company is ordered to return ali
excess lare to those holding the
slips issued under a previous rul

The ground of the decision is
the secrecy practiced by the
company in the methods used in
establishing the fare. In this re
spect the company is declared to
have violated both the spirit and
j the letter of the law. The ques
; tion of the propriety of the fare
itself is not passed upon. The
opinion was written by Com
missioner Michael J. Ryan.
