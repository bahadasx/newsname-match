BRITISH STEADILY
PUSHING FORWARD
Moving Toward the Peronne-Bapaume Road, Behind
German Lines North of jCombles
TAKE 500 YDS. OF TRENCHES EAST OF LE BOUFES
The Germans Are Strongly Contesting British Occupancy of
the Territory Between Thiepval and th Ancre In
Transylvania the Austro-Germans Have Repulsed the
Rumanians at Hermmannstadt In Macedonia the En
tente Allied Troops Are Withstanding Bulgarian At
tacks German Imperial Chancellor, in His Address to
the Reichstag, Declared That the German Line on the
Somme Front "Stands Firm and Unshaken."
Steadily the British troops are .push
ing forward toward the Peronne-Bapaume
road, the mam artery immedi
ately behind the German lines north
of Combles. After taking- 500 yards of
trenches southwest of Le Sars, General
Sir Douglas Haig's men made addi
tional progress in the capture of 500
yards of German trenches east of Le
Boufes.
The British occupancy of the terri
tory between Thiepval and the Ancre
is being contested strongly by the
Germans. A German counter-attack,
following the entry of the British into
a part of the Hessian trench, resulted
in the forcing out of the holders. The
section was regained later, however,
by the British, London says. ETpyy
fighting also has occurred around the
Stuff redoubt.
Rain is hampering operations on the
remainder of the Anglo-French front
north of the Somme, according to offi
cial statements. Paris mentions no
activity following the advance be
tween Fregicourt and Morval toward
Sailly, on the Peronne-Bapaume road.
There has been no great activity on
any of the other fronts in Europe, ex
cept in Transylvania, where the Austro-Germans
have repulsed the Ru
manians at Hermmannstadt. Vienna
Kays the Teutonic forces also have
occupied the hni-hts east and south
east of the town alter violent fighting-.
The battle tn this section, how
ever, has 'not yet beeir-finistied.

LIFE PRESERVER MARKED
"BREMEN" PICKED UP
On the Ocean Side of Cape Elizabeth,
Coast of Maine.
Portland, Maine, Sept. 29. A life
preserver marked "Bremen," the name
of the German submarine freighter
which has been generally expected to
arrive at some Atlantic port for the
past week or more, was picked up on
tne ocean side or cape Elizabeth to
day. The name "Bremen" was stencilled
in black letters two inches high on
both sides of the buoy. On one side
of the canvas covering was printed a
small crown. Over this mark were
the words "Shutz-marke" meaning
patented or trademark. Beneath were
the words "V Bpping-Hoven Wil
helmshaven." This indicated, appar
ently, the name of the maker.
The (preserver seemed to be new and
apparently had not been in the water
a great length of time. It was stain
ed with oil. An officer of the coast
guard cutter service who examined
the buoy, said that if the preserver
had been thrown overboard by some
one who thought to play a practical
Joke, he had done a very good job.
The preserver was well made and
the lettering and the ink were of the
best quality.
The buoy was picked up at a small
place known as Maiden Cove, by a
ten-year-old lad. Frederick Lakeman
of Westbrook. Ai number of other per
sons were present at the time and
saw the youth pick up the object near
the water's edge. The buoy was later
taken to a newspaper office, where it
was photographed and examined by
many seafaring men.
TRAMP AS CARRIER OF
INFANTILE PARALYSIS GERMS
Health Authorities of New Jersey Are
Working on That Theory.
New Tork, Sept. 29. Health author
ities In New Jersey, It became known
today, are searching for a tramp be
lieved to have been a carrier of in
fantile paralysis germs, on the theory
that his case provides the best evi
dence available that the disease is
spread by adult human carriers. It
is believed the man transmitted the
disease to three children of "a farmer
near Patrick's Corners, N. J., who at
the outset of the iplague had shut his
family off from all outside communi
cation. The case Is being studied "by the
United States health officials, it is
said, and widespread hunt for the
tramp, described as a Hungarian
"known only as Zekel, Is expected to
result.
The most rigid quarantine was es
tablished by the farmer.

Russia, appears to have come to an
end. Berlin and Vienna say that the
Russian prisoners have increased to
41 officers and 3,000 men. The forces
under Prince Leopold of Bavaria here
also took two cannon and 33 machine
guns. Berlin records the repulse of
a Russian advance near Goduzischki
and Petrograd claims the defeat of a
German attack near Gukalov. Fight
ing continues in the Carpathians, but
there has been no change in the bat
tle lines.
In Macedonia the entente allied
troops are withstanding Bulgarian at
tacks. The Serbians have checked
four attacks against positions on the
Kaimakcalan plateau and the French
have withstood assaults along the
Eroda River.
Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria,
commander of the German forces on
the Somme front, and Dr. Von Beth-mann-Hollweg,
the imperial chancel
lor, both declare that the efforts of
the French and British to make a
breach in the German lines on the
Somme have been fruitless. The en
tente troops will have to go through
a winter campaign on the Somme and
continue their efforts next year,
Crown Prince Rupprecht is reported
as saying. The imperial chancellor, in
his address to the reichstag, declared
that the German front "therS"" "stands'
firm and unshaken," and "adaed that
"the end is not yet in sight."
LARGE HARVEST THIS
YEAR IN GERMANY
Will Insure increased Rations During
thi Year to Come.
7
Berlin, Sejt. 29 (By Wireless to Say
ville). The iarger harvest of this year
has enabled the authorities not only
to maintain the increased bread ra
tions for persons who have hard man
ual labor- to perform, granted several
months ago, and to provide an addi
tional 50 grammes of flour per day for
young people between 12 and 17 years
of age, as recently announced, savs an
Overseas News agency statement, but
nas made it possible to insure the in
creased rations being maintained dur
ing the entire year to come. TVe au
thorities declare that these increases
are based on conservative reoorts re
garding the size of this year's crops.
The price of rye flour has been re
duced one mark per 100 kilograms, the
announcement adds, and It is expected
that grits, oats and other cereal prod
ucts for soup making will be produced
on a larger scale within a short time,
constituting a considerable improve
ment in the provisioning situation. Im
portant increases in the fodder crops
are pointed to, It being noted that the
yields of oats and barley are far su
perior to those of last year.

v TO CONDUCT THE
JEM. NATIONAL CAMPAIGN.
Printing Will Cost Thcee Times as
Much as In 1912 Because of Increased
Cost of Paper.
New York, Sept. 29. A fund of $1.
500,000 will be required to conduct the
democratic national campaign, accord
ing to a statement made here tonight
by Henry iMorgenthau, treasurer of the
national campaign committee. He de
clared New York was expected to con
tribute about one-third of this amount,
which exceeds by about $400,000 the
sum spent in the 1912 campaign.
"As an example of the increased cost
of the campaign," Mr. Morgenthau
said, the printing bill alone would be
three times as much as it was in 1912
because of the increased price of paper.
He announced that contributions thus
far received exceed by 25 per cent,
those which had been sent up in the
same date in 1912. There nave been
several contributions of $10,000 each,
but only three of more than that sum,
he said.
Thomas L. Chadbourne has been ap
pointed chairman of the New York
state finance committee of the nation
al committee, it was announced. He
expects to have 495 sub-committees at
work within a few days.
HUGHES REPEATS VIEWS '
ON PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Declares He is Not Opposed to Prin
ciple of Eight Hour Day,
HorneW, N. Y., Sept. 26. Charles
E. Hughes went through the south
ern tier of counties in New York state
today over his political battleground
of ten years ago. , He spoke in four
cities and greeted with handshakes
or a few words ten other audiences
in smaller towns.
Mr. Hughes repeated his views on
the protective tariff, the Adamson
law, the maintenance of American
rights and other issues of the cam
paign. He again assayed the admin,
istration for "surrender to force" for
"broken pledges" and for "extrava
gant claims." He reiterated his dec
laration that he stood for protection
in its broadest sense covering Amer
ican, industry, peace and honor.
In his spoeoh at Binghamton and
again at BImira and Corning, the
nominee went further than he had
gone befoe in making known his
views on the eight hour day.
"I am not opposed to the principle
of the eight hour day," Mr. Hughes
said. "I favor the free operation of
the eight hour day I should like to
see an eight hour day."
ROOSEVELT-TAFT CAMPAIGN
BUTTONS NOT TO BE WORN,
Only Hughes Buttons at Union League
Reception of Republican Nominee.
ew York, Sept. '29. -tNo. campaJgu
buttons bearing pictures of Theodore
Roosevelt, William H. Taft and Charles
E. Hughes will be worn by guests at
the Union League club reception in
honor of the republican presidential
candidate next Tuesday evening, it was
learned tonight. Chairman William R.
Willeox of the national committee is
said to have been informed, although
not by Mr. Hughes, that if campaign
buttons are distributed they should
bear enly the likeness of the candidate
himself.
Friends of Colonel Roosevelt are re
ported to have intimated to Mr. Will
cox that undue emphasis has been
placed upon the fact that the colonel
and Professor Taft will meet at the
reception for the first time in the field
of politics since the progressive' party
was born in 1912, resulting in the men
who are now the living ex-Dresidents
being arrayed against each" other in
the contest for the presidency.
PARKER DENIES HE OFFERED

New Orleans, La., Sept. 29. John M.

to President Wilson offering to speak
directly for him, but said he would

"I have not written t.-
Vv ilson, or to any of his campaign
managers, offering to speak directly in
his behalf," said 'Mr. Parker over the
telephone from hi nn '1 1 TYl .1 lir,mA "
Pass Christian, Miss. "I did write re
cently to uamondge Colby, a New
York progressive leader, stating that I
was willing to be used in whatever

periods and they are anxious to know what is being offered in rew
materials, new designs, new garments, new furnishings, in fact they
want to know where they can meet their requirements to the best
advantage.
It is not possible for all to give up the time that would be re
quired in visiting all the shops on a tour of inspection, but they do
have spare moments which are devoted to the study of the advertise
ments which are put forth by the. business houses which are seeking
this trade,

The wise merchant will therefor utilize the business developing as
