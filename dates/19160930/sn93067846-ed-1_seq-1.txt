London, Sept. 37.?The 26 mile bat?
tle-arc running from the Ancre river
to the Somme is rapidly being trans?
formed by the great offensive of the
entente allies into an irregular traln
gular wedge in the German line with
the base, respectively, in front of
Thlepval and west of Peronne and
the point projeoting across the Be
thune road and into the St. Pierre
Vaast wood.
On the^urlttsh end of the line, in
the regjon of Thiopval and eastward
to the north of Flers, the British in
Wednesday's lighting gained further
successes over the Germans and
likewise the French east and south?
east of Kancourt drove their troops
forward and entered the St. Pierre
Vaast wood.
To the south of this region from
Bouohavesnes to the southern edge
of the Bols L'Abbe farm, the French
'were compelled to face a violent at-1
tack by the Germans, which was
beaten off, the Germans being thrown
back In disorder, according to Paris.
The British gains Included German
trenches on a front of 2,000 yards
north of Flers and a strong redoubt
on a hill J',000 yards northeast of
Thlepval. To the northwest, across
the Ancre, successful raids were car?
ried out by the British opposite Beau
mont\Hamel.
Ten thousand prisoners have fallen
Into the bar ds of the British in the

The embassy believes the renewal

as combining with Japan's vital in?

both sides.
Japan's policy towards the pro?

POOR OLD CONSUMER HiT HARD
PRICE*1 OF FOOD AX I) CLOTHES
EXPECTED TO GO STILL
HIGHER.
Prioet of One und Two Years Ago
Contoured With Prices Now?War
in Europe is Generally Hlunied For
Most Increases.
The prices of food, clothing, luxuries
and other materials of all sorts are
advancing at such an alarming rate
that the average citizen's brain is
made fairly dizzy by the nightmare of
the high cost of living. Local mer?
chants and producers say that the
prices for#food will be even higher
this winter. With everything soaring
and no way of dodging the increased
cost in sight, poor old consumer bids
fair to face one of the hardest win?
ters of his career.
It is rather discouraging to try to
get at the cause of boosted prices.
Everybody who has anything to sell is
demanding more money for it. Ask
any merchant or dealer why he has
raised his prices and he will tell you
that he has to pay more for every?
thing he sells, and that some other
price maker started raising first. Go
to the farmer and he will tell you his
fertilizer, seed and everything else
which he uses in making a crop cost.*
more. Owing to the fact that the
greatest rise in prices has been noted
since the outbreak of the war in
Europe, most people are inclined to
make the war the scapegoat.
Despite the difficulties besettling an
inquiry Ino the causes of the rise in
the cost of living, for which everyone
seems to have a pet theory, it is a
comparatively simple matter to ascer?
tain from tho price records of two
years ago and today, just what com?
modities have advanced and what they
arc --'.Hing for at wholesale on the lo?
cal market.
For many reasons, the wholesale
price is the most satisfactory in mak?
ing a comparison. They show what
he retail butcher or grocer had to pay
more, but'they do not, of course, show
?vhat he charged more. Local retail
quoto about the same prices. The re
tall prices can be arrived at approxi?
mately by adding from 15 to 20 per
cent, to the wholesale price.
Comparing the wholesale prices of
certain articles of food today with
what they were one year ago, a pro?
prietor of a local restaurant stated
?hat he had to pay eight cents more a
pound for ham, five cents more a
pound for lard ,a cent more a loaf for
bread, 22 cents more a pound for
Swiss cheese, $2 more a barrel for
flour, ten cents more a pound for but?
ter and 14 cents more a dozen for
eggs.
The wholesale prices of food staples
\s quoted by local merchants and the
prices on the same articles In Sep?
tember show the following increases:
Sottr, $6 to $8 per barrel; bread per
loaf, 3 1-2 to 4 1-2 cents; coffee, 11
1-2 to 13 cents; sugar, 6 1-2 to 8
?.ents per pound; lard, 9 to 12 cents
per pound; molasses, 30 to 4 5 cents
per gallon; rice 5 to 5 1-2 cents a
pound; navy beans, 4 1-2 to 7 1-4
ents per pound.
Local shoe dealers state that men
and women here will have to pay
about 50 cents more per pair for the
better grades of shoes, while clothing
merchants here say that men's suits
will cost on the average of from
$1.50 to $2 more per suit in the $18
ind $25 grades. Real estate men say
hat rental o| houses will be about
the same as last year.
Wholesalers said that canning hous?
es all over the country have announc?
ed that their deliveries will be only
one-third of the normal amount. The
vegetable crop, it was declared, was
only half what was expected.
Canned fruits will be 30 per cent.
higher and canned vegetables will be
advanced from 15 to 20 per eent. ac?
cording to wholesalers. Paper bags,
which a year ago could be purchased
In wholesale ? lots for II cents, now
cost $1.55. The advance is typical of
all paper and paper products.
Cigar jobbers raised their prices
last week. Five cent cigars, which
the dealer has been getting for $31 or
$.'?2 a thousand, have been advanced
to $r,r?, better gr..des of rlgars also
have been advanced.

The public spirited ladies of the
Sumter Civic League are the "men

dear ladies who know more about

as a local man recently put it.
For some time many merchants
have been busy preparing for this no?

;and sister counties of the great Pee

The interesting program is as fol?

The mercantile establishments will

Colleton, Charleston, Beaufort, Dor?

No expense is being spared to make
this a big event. The Sumter ladles
know how to pull off a first class fash?

demonstrated before, and the Sumter
men know how to take orders from
and help their lady friends to make
fashion shows, fashion promenades,
and other combination social, com?

The Retail Dealers' Association of
Sumter is in this event "up to its

beautiful Sumter women, if you have
sense enough to do what they tell
you and don't attempt to argue with
them.
