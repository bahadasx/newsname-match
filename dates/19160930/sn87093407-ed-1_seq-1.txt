Come Along, Senator,
With Those Reasons
NEW YORK, N. Y„ 12:45 P. M., SEPT. 29, 1916.
Seattle Star, Seattle, Wash.
George Turner telegraphs he has convincing reasons why
you should support him instead of Poindexter and would like
to present them.
10:47 A. M. NORMAN HAPGOOD.
I lie Star is in receipt of the telegram printed above.
We know Norman Hapgood quite well. We know him for one of the
ablest magazine editors in the country. We knew the strength of his virile pen
when he was editor of Collier's Weekly and later editor of Harper's. And we
know, too, that lie is now one of the big leaders in the national headquarters of
the Woodrow Wilson Independent league.
\nd Norman Hapgood, too, on the other hand, knows well that The Star
is independent and not partisan, and has worked with him often in the effort to
keep good men in office and bad men out of it.
We can understand Norman Hapgood.
But we're blessed if we can understand good old Sen. Turner.
We take it that he is convinced I lie Star should support him for U. S.
senator instead of Miles Poindexter.
So he telegraphs to Norman Hapgood at New York that he would like to
present his reasons to The Star at Seattle.
Why, bless you. George, come right ahead.
The editorial offices of The Star are wide open—and have always been so,
for those who want to discuss things on their merits.
We really dolTt undirsfana '**hy you should have to telegraph to Norman
Hapgood at New York and have him "telegraph The Star, 3,000 miles away,
that you. would like to talk matters over with The Star.
Why don't vou drop in here and say what you have to sav directly to us?
Senator Poindexter does that. Others do it. and always, as the years
have gone, candidates have been tree to come to The Star to tell us about their
good points.
If you are as good a man as Senator Poindexter to represent this state.
The Star will be mighty glad to learn it.
If you are a better man than Poindexter. Lite Star will be right tickled.
The Star would certainly enjoy a situation where the state gets a good
man if one man is elected and a better man if the other fellows wins.
Come on, Senator, let us hear those "convincing reasons why The Star
should support you instead of Poindexter."
And remember this, The Star judges candidates by their records, not by parti
san platitudes.
Sen. Poindexter is just completing six years in the senate. He has made his
record. '
You, too, have your record, Sen. Turner.
Certainly, senator, come right along. Tell us why you think we should ask
the people to throw Sen. Poindexter out and put you in.
