are to the effect that, the Colonel
is improving rapidly after un
dergoing an operation in which
the second toe of the foot was
amputated to check a bad case of
blood poison ing. The Colonel's
friends here hope to see Mr.
Weedin out soon. Florence

The farmers in the vicinity of
Mesa had a meeting recently
for the purpose of organizing a
farm loan association as provid
ed for by the rural credits law.
An . organization of this kind
is necessary in order to secure
loans on farm lands under the
law recently enacted. This is
the first organization in the Salt
River valley since the passage
of the bill in congress.
As a result of the visit of the
city council and city attorney to
Los Angeles, a.nd their confer
ence with the management of
the Title, Insurance & Trust
company, which now has control
of the water, power, light and
gas plants in Yuma, it is prob
able that a proposition for bond
ing the city for $200,000 for the
purpose of taking over and im
proving the plants will appear
on the ballot at the December
city election. Sun.
Approximately 11.000 acres of
state land, bringing in a revenue
to the State of Arizona of about
55,000 were sold today at public
auction on the courthouse steps,
the sale having been conducted
by Land Commissioners P. J.
Munch and Beu K. Clark. Most
of the land sold today lies in the
Sulphur Spring valley and one
tract known as "Mud Springs"
in the valley brought the hand

A pretty little home wedding
was solemnized last Tuesday at
high noon, when Mr. Harry Pat
terson was married to Miss
Mabel Sipe, at the home of Al
bert Gatlin, brother in-law of
the bride, near town. The wed
ding occurred in the presence of
only the immediate relatives of
the contracting parties, Mr. and
Mrs. Albert Gatlin standing
sponsors for the young couple
as attendants, and the ceremony
being performed by Justice Jack
Price. Patagonian.
The total assessed valuation
of the state cf Arizona for the
ensuing fiscal year amounts to
$486,000,000,00 which is a gain
of approximately $66,000,000.00
over the assessed valuation for
last year. The state rate for
taxation purposes upon each
one hundred dollars valuation
for last year was 51 cents. This
year the State Board of Equal
ization has fixed the rate at 40
cents, on each one hundred dol"
lars valuation, which is a reduc
tion of 14 cents from the 1915 rate.
"FATHER OF SANTA CRUZ."
Hon. J. C. Evans, who was
with Gov. Hunt in the 17th terri
torial assembly, the first legisla
tive experience for either of
them, is in Phoenix, having
come from the coast on Wednes
day. Squire Evans makes his
home at Roosevelt, Arizona, but
he has spent the summer in Los
Angeles. In 1899 he was named
the father of Santa Cruz county,
which title he will carry as long
as he resides in Arizona.
Soeaking of Governor Hunt,
Squire Evans says: "I have
voted eleven or twelve times for
him and he has never been de
feated either in primary or elec
tion. He will wTin again this
year; they can not beat him."
Mr. Evans is at the Kersting.
He will remain a few days at
least before returning to his
home.
We remember going to Noga
les with Mr. Evans and a legis
late committee in '99 to take a
look at the new county to see
whether it was worthy of adop
tion. The boys were treated so
well by the good people of No
gales, Arizona, and of Sonora,
Mex., that they would have ad
trdtted both to self L'ovprnraent
such procedure. iViossenger.
SIXTY FOURTH.
Congress Adds to Record of Achieve
ment. In the first session of the Sixty-fourth
Congress, which ad
journed September 9, important
additions were made to the story
of deeds accomplished under
Woodrow Wilson. Their recital
contrasts vividly with the mere
words of Candidate Hughes.
Here is the record, in brief:
Tariff commission established,
thereby taking the tariff out of
politics in so far as it is possible
in the United States.
Adequate preparedness
against foreign aggression pro
vided by appropriations for ex
pansion of the army and navy
amounting to $635,000,000.
GeneH
would
1 railway strike, which
ve paralyzed the pros
perity oi
the country, avoided
ssage of the Adamson
by the
eight hqjur law.
Ru rallcredits banking system
established by the passage of
the Feqeral Farm Loan Act,
which assures adequate capital
at fair interest rates for the de
velopment of American agricul
tural resources.
Federkl Reserve act amended
to permit national backs to join
together in establishing foreign
branches.
Good roads enacted that makes
available $75,000,000 for the de
velopment of highways through
out the? country, under safe
guards which prevent wasteful
use of tie money.
Ship P-urchase act passed for
the encouragement and develop
ment of the American merchant
marine.
Child Labor Law put through
which emancipates children from
industrial oppression.
Resolutions for the surrender
of American rights at sea over
whelmingly defeated.
Incoirie tax increased; inherit
ance tax provided and a tax on
the net profits of manufacturers
of munitions of war established,
to pay the cost of preparedness.
Worksmen's compensation law
applying to government em
ployes enacted.
Grain grades and warehouse
laws passed for the assistance of
agriculture.
These were but some of the
principal new deeds of the con
gress under President Wilson.
They are added to the important
work done in the first two years
of the Wilson administration by
the Sixty-third congress. For
the full story see "The Record
of Achievement" in the Demo

BETTER BABIES CONTEST.
At the Santa Cruz County Fair at So
noita in October.
An interesting feature of the
County Fair at Sonoita will be
the Better Babies Exhibit. The
mothers of the county, and those
persons interested in better
health among the coming gener
ation of citizens are devoting a
good deal of attention to the
contest. They have decided that
if it is worth while to have com
petitive exhibits of crops and
livestock at the Fair, with farm
advisors and study classes
through the year to improve our
crops and our livestock, it is
worth while to take a day to
compare the babies of the coun
ty, study their physical condi
tion, aud learn from authorit
ative sources if anything is need
ed by the individual child to
help it become of the greatest
value in the future to Santa Cruz
county and the state.
This contest will be under the
auspices of the Woman's Home
Companion, and the Fair is co
operating with and following the
plan recommended by the na
tional leaders of the movement
for more perfect physical and
mental equipment for our future
Americans. The directors have
enlisted the services of the best
local physicians, several experts
from the medical corps of the
militia, and competent commit
tees from the ladies of the
county.
The physicians of Nogales
have considered the contest of
such importance that they have
agreed to donate their services
for October 20th, and the follow
ing named committees are to as
sist them in the capacities in
dicated: Superintendent: Mrs. E. R.
Purdum, of Nogales.
Committee on Publicity : Mrs.
J. Larimore, of Nogales.
Committee on Place and Equip
ment: Mrs. Mark Manning,
Mrs. Joseph Cai, of Sonoita.
Committee on Entrance and
Earolicnent: Mrs. Sterling, Mrs.
Ada Jones, Mrs. Arthur Whit
field, Mrs. James Barry, of No
gales.

ined physically and mentally by
medical experts, and their scor
ing card will be returned to the
parents with instructions to the
parents which will enable them
to correct any defects discovered.
1916 STATE FAIR GROUNDS IM
PROVEMENTS. People attending the State
Fair this fall will be agreeably
surprised at the numerous
changes that have taken place
upon the Fair Grounds. For
several months past landscape
gardeners have been busy beau
tifying the grounds. Several
hundred umbrella trees and
palms have been placed along
the drives and walks, and rose
bushes and chrysanthemums
have been planted at every ad
vantageous point. Vines have
been set out around the build
ings and are being trained so
that by fair week the exhibit
buildings and adjoining fences
will be a mass of foliage.
The live stock sheds, which
heretofore have extended from
the main entrance to a point op
posite the grandstand, and which
have always been an eye sore
on the grounds, are being re
moved to a position on the north
end of the grounds, where they
will be conveniently arranged
and where an excellent judging
ring will bo erected for the pur
pose of judging the live stock.
On the ground formerly occu
pied by these buildings will be
the automobile park, with en
trance on Nineteenth Avenue,
opposite the entrance to the
grandstand. At this point the
automobile busses running from
the city will discharge their
passengers, and private cars
may enter the automobile park,
where guards will be employed,
assuring them every protection,
for a nominal fee.
In ill ace of the high board
fence which at present encloses
the southwest section of the
grounds will be erected a hand
some woven wire fence. It is
the intention of the Fair Com
mission to add to this lence each
year until the entire grounds
are enclosed, thus doing away
with the old high board fence.
Another addition this year for
the convenience of tfie public is
the extension of the street car
tracks into the Fair Grounds.
Heretofore the cars have un
loaded and taken on passengers
at the main entrance. This year
arrangements have been made
to have cars run into the grounds
after four o'clock each afternoon
and take on passengers at a
station just opposite the grand
stand. The sheds occupied by the
Swine Department have always
been more or less crowded. The
Commissioners have ordered the
exhibit space in this department
doubled and the construction of
new sheds is now in progress.
This condition also is true of the
Poultry Department, and the
new Poultry Building will have
twice as much floor space as
heretofore.
The Kennel Department, un
der the direction of the Arizona
Kennel Club, expect this year to
put on the biggest bench show
ever held in the Southwest, and
have advised the commission
that the quarters heretofore set
aside for this department are
too small. The old "Pets De
partment Building" therefore,
has been reconstructed and turn
ed into an up-to date Fire De
partment, where one of the au
tomobile trucks of the Phoenix
Fire Department will be kept
throughout Fair Week, and an
enormous tent has been ordered
for the dogs which will be ship
ped here from all parts of the
country. Benches will be ar
ranged around the walls of the
tent. In the center will be ar
ranged a judging ring, in which
all dogs entered will be judged
by Dr. Geo. M. Clayton, of Chi
cago, a man of national reputa
tion, who is employed as judge
in practically all of the big ken
nel shows of the country.
The brick barn just opposite
the grandstand is being remo
deled, painted and put in shape
for an automobile show, and al
ready the major portion of the
space in this building has been
sold to the automobile dealers of
the state.
Perhaps the improvement that
will be the most pleasing to vis
itors at the Fair this year is the
ladies' rest room. This room
has been completely renovated
and refurnished. Here the vis
itors at the Fair will find a cool
place to rest and make them
selves comfortable. A check
room will be operated in connec
tion with this department, where
bundles and wraps may be
shecked.
Taken all in all the Fair
Grounds will present an entire
ly new appearance this year and
the Fair Commission have left
nothing undone which will con
tribute to the success of the
Fair and the comfort of the
public.
While unloading a revolver
last Sunday morning Santiago
Franco, 19, accidentally shot
and killed Carlos Romero, a boy
about 15 years old. The Romero
boy grabbed the gun, thinking
all the cartridges had been ex
tracted. No inquest was held
over the remains, as it was ex
plained by relatives of both boys,
who were present at the time,
as well as by the attending phy
sician, that the death was ac
cidental and not caused by un
lawful or suspicious means. In
terment was made in the local
cemetery. Patagonian.
