FOOD PROBLEM
IN HUNGARY IS
Quantity of Grain Not Suf
ficient to Meet Normal
Consumption.
ARMY NOT TO
BE HAMPERED
Premier Declares That Peo
ple Will be Able to Get
Through.
London, Sept. 30.—The food prob
lem in Hungary is reported unoffi
cially as very pressing.
Reuter's Amsterdam correspondent
reports that Premier Tisza informed
the Hungarian chamber that the gov
ernment calculations regarding the
crops have been upset by continuous
bad weather, and that the quantity of
grain is not sufficient to meet the
normal consumption.
The premier assured the charrfber,
however, that the amount of food
available will be sufficient to save the
population from want, as the people
of Austria-Hungary had accustomed
themselves to consume less than be
fore the war.
The premier accepted the responsi
bility for seeing to it that the short
age of foodstuffs did not interfere
with the fighting capabilities of the
monarchy.

ANTI-SUFFRAGISTS

New York, Sept. 30.—Plans to ex

ASK EMBARGO~ON
FLOUR AND WHEAT
Chicago, Sept. 30.—Resolutions ask
ing an embargo on wheat and flour
were adopted yesterday at a meeting
of club women, most of whom defend
ed bakers here for raising the price
1 of bread. The increase, they declar
ed, w^s justified by war export, crop
(shortage and added manufacturing
Jexpenses due to improved sanitary

At the same time, officials in the of

Ithere was any illegal agreement
^among the bakers to raise prices, call
led attention to quotations from Euro

Chicago, Sept. 30.—Two more men
and one woman were arrested here
today by the agents of the bureau of
Investigation of the department of
justice in connection with the opera
tions of the so-called Mann act black
mailers syndicate. The arrests were
made after an all night vigil by fed

Two of those arrested gave the

Federal officers are holding a num
ber of letters written by a wealthy
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, merchant to two
Chicago girls. The merchant claims
the girls lured him to their apart

ates, forced him to pay $15,000.
Attorneys for the girls claim the
letters prove the Iowan wronged the
girls and then made the payment ad
recompense.
The arrests were made when the

Mrs. Golden's husband was one of

Underwood tariff law, wnusi. he said,
though a "tariff for re^onu-i o'.iJy."
had proved "an utter failure"' in thii
regard, and had failed entirely to pro

"But for the great Europeia war,"
Senator Nelson continued, "snd the

demand, this last Democratic tariff
act would have resulted In us f,T*at,

The war, the speaker declared, has

to the Democratic party. During :ts

delinquencies and shortcomings of

Rumanian forces have been repulsed

statement issued from general head
quarters. The battle there has not
yet been concluded. The statement
follows:
"The Rumanians have been re
pulsed at Hermannstadt. The heights
south and southeast of the' town, aft

of the allies (Teutons), but the bat
tle has not yet been concluded.
"In the O&rpathlans the fighting

Alta hut was repulsed.
"The summit of Monte Cimone has
been subjected continuously, to heavy
artillery fire. Notwithstanding this,
ligerents "could not have cost Presi
dent Wilson any sleepless nights," the
speaker said, adding:
"The truth, In brief, is that none of
the belligerents could well get at us.
nor we at them. The only war Presi
dent Wilson has had on his hands
and suffered from has been a diplo
matic war, and that has been carried
on by'him with no credit or glory to
our country."
The senator referred only briefly to
the administration's Mexican policy,
which he said was "vacillating and
erratic, and certainly not to the cred
it of our country."'
The shipping law, passed at the last
session of congress, will prove a
"costly and money-losing experiment
on the part'of the government, yield

tion," the speaker said, "but proving
itself a burden and a drawback to

The scheme Is the worst form of state
socialism.
Senator Nelson voiced disapproval
of the federal reserve bank system,
which, he said, has "so far proved
Itself to be a most expensive luxury."
Instead of twelve reserve banks, the
speaker advocated one central reser
voir for the harboring of the nation's
reserves.
The so-called rural credit law, the
senator said, "will be found to be of

London. Sept. 80.—The address of
the German Imperial chancellor. Dr.
Von Bethmann.-Hollweg. in the Reich
stag is more remarkable for what it
omitted than for what it said, accord
ing to Lord Robert Cecil, minister of
war trade, who, in discussing the
speech with The Associated Press to
day declared the most significant fact
In connection with the chancellor's
utterance was his failure to mention
Belgium. Lord Robert said:
"There is very definite change In
the tone of the speech over the prev
ious efforts of the chancellor. The
talk of a complete German victory is
entirely absent. Another remarkable
thing was that there was not a word
about Belgium. The significance of
this is probably that he was unable to
say anything about Belgium as his
listeners can be assumed to be the
whole world and he was bound to of
fend a section of It If Belgium was
mentioned. If he attempted to justify
German occupation, he would offend
the best of all neutral opinion, and
equally he would offend his own peo
ple it he expressed a determination to
give up that country.
"Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollweg's de
nunciation of England, while violent,
contained nothing really new. It was
merely the old trick of attempting to
convince our allies that we are trad
ing on their efforts and bleeding them
to death in the process, but recent
events on the Somme ought to con
vince him of his error. The Idea that
we want world supremacy is fantas
tic."
Discussing this phase of the chan
cellor's speech, Lord.Robert declared:
"You will, note that In. this race for
^commercial supremacy, England ijt

BELIEVE TRAMP IS
PLAGUE CARRIER
New York. Sept. 30.—Health au
thorities in New Jersey, it became
known yesterda'y, are searching for a
tramp believed to have been a carrier
of infantile paralysis germs, on the
theory that his case provides the best
evidence available that the disease is
spread by adult human carriers. It is
believed the man transmitted the
disease to three children of a farmer
near Patrick's Corners, X. who at
the outset of the plague had shut his
family off from all outside communi
cation.
The case is being studied by United
States health officials, it is said, and
a wide-spread hunt for the tramp, de
scribed as a Hungarian known only as
"Zekel." is expected to result.
The most rigid quarantine was es
tablished by the farmer on his prem
ises. The tramp, however, was given
employment. He slept in the barn,
but ate his meals in the house. He
remained only a few days and soon
after, he left three of the children in
the family were stricken with the dis

Lord Robert continued:
"Anyone can readily see that we
made no preparation for any such con
test for world supremacy.
"I note in the portion of the speech
devoted to efforts for peace that my
name is used, but I cannot under
stand his complaint. That Germany
was once ready for peace means noth
ing, as naturally everybody is ready
for peace on his own terms. The Ger
mans are ready, not for peace, but
for a trupe to enable them to pre
pare to enforce their own terms on the
world. There will be no peace as long
as Germany is content to be ruled by
a military caste."
Discussing the reference in the
chancellor's speech to the death of the
King of Rumania, the minister of war
trade said:
"Of course, it is quite possible that
the strain imposed by the war may
have caused his death, as the king
was an old man, but it Is also quite
possible that that theory of the cause
of death may be based on Dr. Beth
mann-Hollweg's Imagination."
Lord Robert said that he believed
the German imperial chancellor was
sincere In his declaration that Ger
many was waging war with every
possible instrument. Continuing, he
said:
"The lull in submarine warfare is
due to a shortage in submarines, and.
it is always increased when instru

PUBLISHED TODAY
Death of Flight Lieutenant
Rockwell Precipitat
ed It.
Berlin (via London), Sept. 30
Practically all Berlin newspapers to
day contribute to the bitter criticism
being made on Americans who joined
the French army.
The news of the death In action of
Flight Lieutenant Kiffen Rockwell,
had precipitated the storm of criti
cism.
The Post says the presence of Rock
well and others in enemy camps can
not be regarded as the acts of indi
viduals. but declares that America
sends its own citizens to the Euro
pean theaters of war to light Ger
many. The paper says the Rockwell
Incident shows "to what depth the re
gard for neutrality has sunk among
our enemies and in America. Such an
unheard of conception of neutrality
deserves to be labelled in the plain
est way and not forgotten."
The Tagliche Rundwhau speaks of
the concepts of neutrality as entirely
lost and the Kreuz Zeitung, the Ger
niania and the Boersen Zeitung print
similar statements. The latter prints
its comment in Ihe largest bold faca
type.
GERMANS STII1
BELIEVE THEY
CAN W LINE
Confident that Entente Can
not Make Breach, at
Somme.
Berlin, Sept. 28, Via London, Sept.
30.—(Delayed)—The latest fighting
on the Somme evidently has not
shaken the confidence of the German
military leaders in their ability to
prevent the breach in their lines. The
Berliner Tageblatt's special war cor
respondent interviewed Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria, commander of
the German forces on the Somme,
Tuesday, and the crown prince in his
utterances expressed complete confi
dence in the situation for the present
and future.
The crown prince is quoted as hav
ing said that since the offensive be
gan the Entente allies had gained
some ground, but there could be no
thought of this decisively changing
the situation.
"It is impossible to predict how
things will go hereafter." said Prince
Rupprecht. but one thing is certain,
namely, that we have everything so
thoroughly prepared that we are able
to contemplate the situation with
equanimity, whatever comes.
"We can reckon upon an offensive
of great persistance and with heavy
attacks, accompanied by an enormous
expenditure of ammunition. But we
have taken precautions. Our artil
lery has been reinforced, and like
wise our aeroplane corps and our
fliers have had fine successes in the
last few days, although they have
bad bard fighting against increased
numbers. Our artillery derives ad
vantages from the successful work of
the aeroplanes, after having formerly
been much exposed to observation by
hostile aviators.
"Our troops have been striking with
the utmost strength and the enemy
has found the nut too hard to crack.
It is my distinct opinion that the en»
emy is trying to force a decision at
this spot and during this year, and
he has not yet succeeded. He will
have to put up with a winter cam
paign and continue his fighting next
