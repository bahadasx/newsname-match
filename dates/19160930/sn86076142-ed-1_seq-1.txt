BENSON SAYS WILSON
IS A FOE TO LABOR
Socialist Banner Bearer Pays His
Compliments to Both of His
Rival Candidates
(Br Aaaoelated Pr.)
NEW YORK. Sept. 30. Allan L.
Bennon, nominee of the Socialist
party for president, addressing two
meetings of Socialists In Brooklyn
last night, accused President Wilson
of being an enemy of labor and de
clared that no issue is too dead for
Charles E. Hughes, the Republican
nominee for president, to revive.
"President Wilson calls himself the
friend of the working man," he said,
"He cannot be a friend because he is
your enemy. In yeara past when Mr.
Wilson vu president of Princeton
University and when he did not need
your voles, he devoted some of his
fine English to the telling of what
monstrous Institutions labor unions
are. He bas now reached a situation
when he no longer talks, that way.
He now poseB as a friend of labor.
If he Is your friend he would use his
frlendtthip to protect the life and
property of the working man. He has
not done this."
Mr. Benson said Mr. Hughes and
Mr. Wilson are silent on the Hay
Chamberlain army reorganization bill,
which he termed the draft bill, and
added:
"Mr. Hughes Is not concerning him
self with the draft bill, but with
General Huerta, who Is dead. There
is no issue too dead for Mr. Hughes.
What kind of a gentleman's agree
ment has he and Mr. Wilson, so that
no mention of the 'draft bill' has been
made in this campaign?"

cording to I-ord Robert Cecil, min
ister of war trade, who, In discussing
the speech with the Associated Press
today, declared the most significant
fact In connection with the chancel
lor's utterance was his failure to
nention Belgium. Lord Robert said:
"There is a very definite rhunge

previous efforts of the chancellor.
The talk of a complete Gorman vic
tory is entirely absent. Another re
markable thing was that there was
not a word about Belgium. The sig-

niflcance of this is probubly that he
was unable to say anything about
Belgium as his listeners can be the
whole world and he was bound to
offend a section of it if Belgium was
mentioned. And equally he would
offend bis own people if he expressed
a determination to give up that
country. '
"Dr. von Helliiniinn llollweg's do
nunciution of England contained noth
ing really new. It was merely (be
old trick of attempting to convince
our allies that we are trading on
their efforts and bleeding them to
death in the process, but recent
events on the Somme ought to con
vince him of his error. The idea
that we want world supremacy is
fantastic."

BERLIN, Sept. 30. The latest fight

Tuesday.
The crown prince Is quoted as hav

some ground, but there could be no
thought of this decisively changing
the situation.
"It is Impossible to predict how
things will go hereafter," said Prince
Rupprecht, "but one thing Is certain
namely, that we have everything so
thoroughly prepared that we are abje
to contemplate the 'situation with
equanimity, whatever cornea. The
offensive will certainly not reach an

"We can reckon upon an offensive
Of great persistence and with heavy
attacks accompanied by an enormous
expenditure of ammunition. But we

has been reinforced and likewise our
aeroplane corps, and our filers have
had fine successes in the last few
days, although they have had hard
fighting against Increased numbers.
Our artillery derives advantages from
the successful work of the aeroplanes
after having formerly been much ex
posed to observation by hostile avia
tors. "Our troops have been striking
with the utmost strength land the
enemy has found the nut too hard
to crack. It is my distinct opinion
that the enemy is trying to force a

He will have to put up with a winter
campaign and continue hia fighting
next year." '

of the New York Central railroad
company, plying between Manhattan

the rush hours late yesterday by a
strike of 150 employes on the boats.

strike has no connection, it was said,
with the traction situation.
Thousands of commuters gathered
at the two Manhattan ferry stations
of the company, the crowds over
flowing the ferry houses into the
streets, where a heavy rain was fall
ing. Not until police reserves were
called out did the commuters aban
don their demand for boats. They
left the city for their homes in New

tribute about one-third of this
amount, which exceeds by about

campaign.
As an example of the increased
cost of the present campaign,' Mr.
Morgenthau said that the printing bill
alone would be three times as much
as it was in 1912 because of the in

had been sent in up to the same date
In 1912. There have been several
contributions of $10,000 each, but only
