BREMEN BELIEVED
MAY HAVE BEEN
WRECKED
life Preserver Picked Up Bearing
Nam0 Bremen"
V,.
WAS FOUND OH- iyiaINE COAST
Submarine Was Reported Off Long
Island Sound and Then
Disappeared.
Portland, Me., Sept. 30 A life pre
server marked "Bremen," the name of
the Gterm&u submarine freighter which
has been generally expected to arrive
at some Atlantic coast port for the
past week or more, was picked' up on
the ocean side of Cape Elizabeth yes
terday. The name "Bremen" was
stenciled in black letters two inches
high on both sides of the buoy. On
one side of the canvas covering was
printed B small crown. Over this mark
were the words "Shutz-inarke," mean
ing patented, or trade-mark. Beneath
were the words "V Epping-Hoven WiJ-
belmshaven. ibis indicated, appar
ently, the uanie of the maker.
The preserver seemed to he new
and apparently had not been in the
water a great length of time. It was
stained with oil. An officer of the
coast guard cutter service who exam
Ined the buoy said that If the pre
server had been thrown overboard by
someone who thought to play a prac
tical joke, he had done a very good
job. The preserver was well made
and the lettering and the ink were of
the best uallty.
The buoy was picked up at a small
place known as .Maiden i ove. uv a
10-year-old lad, Frederic L. Lake-
man of Wefltbrook. A number of otli
er persons were nearby at the time
and saw the youth pick up the object
from the beach near the water's edge.
The buoy was later taken to a news
paper oflice, where It was photo
graphed and examined by many sea
tearing men.
No submarine had been sighted in
the waters adjacent to New London at
a late hour last night. Officials of tht
Eastern forwarding company and the
T. A. Scott wrecking company, agents
in this country for the German line
of undersea merchant inent. claimed
they had no knowledge of the near
approach of a German submarine.
A fisherman at Pleasant View, near
Watch Hill, it. I., overlooking Long
Island sound, reported last night that
lie had seen with liis marine L-la: si-s ,i
large submarine proceeding in the di
rection of New London, where the
Bremen lias been expected for more
than a week. She was tin n miles
east of New London, and Showed on
her mast a brinht white light above a
green light. These lights, accordln
to the observer, were the ones lie had
been told by ('apt. Robinson of the tug
Westerly would be tarried bv the tier-
man submarine which the tug snnu
days ago had been ordered to look for
The submarine was unaccompanied
and displayed no Ilai: I he observer
who professed to be familiar with tin
appearance of American submarines
which have their base at New London
said that she was of a different typi
from any he had seen The boat was
about two miles offshore and was go-
ing at a moderate rate of speed. The
sea was very choppy.

REPUBLICAN PLATFORM
As Adopted by State Convention
bf
Nominees.
Believing that the voters of any
body politic are entitled to know the
principles upon which a party seeks
their BUtfrage, we, the republicans of
Vermont, by our representatives in
State convention assembled, do hereby
declare the principles for which we
stand.
We again renew our allegiance to
at party which from it organization
as stood for the protection of Atneri-
ui citizens and American rights at
home ami abroad, and pledge our
earnest and support to the Platform
recently adopted by that party in na
tional convention assembled. We re
call with pride ihe position taken by
Vermont in that convention Which
had so large a part in bringing about
the nomination of our peerless leader.
Charles Evans Hughes,
Appreciating, as never before, the
virtue and power of u united party, we
commend the patriotism of strong,
courageous and devoted leaders who
have enrolled themselves once more
under our banner, and we urge all re
publicans te supreme and victorious
effort under the leadership of men like
Theodore Roosevelt, William II. Tali
and Charles 10 vans Hughes.
We recognize the tact that agricul
ture is the predominant industry of
our commonwealth and the chief
source of our material prosperity, We
believe that nowhere in the United
States are there greater agricultural
opportunities than in Vermont, and
thai our citizens should be encouraged
to remain upon tm laruis of our State
anil that all measures looking to the
upbuilding of agriculture, both in
method and practical results, should
commend themselves to the favorable
consideration of the General Assembly
and that the teaching of practical agri
culture should be prosecuted with vig
or and effli ieiicy.
Hood roads are essential and nneno
sary ror tht: highest development or
our state in all its phases, and the
proper expenditure ol our money for
better highways means new and high'
er attainments in all walks of life, and
ttl'.c extension of highway improve
ments to rural communities Will en
hance the value of our hill farms and
add pleasure and protit to a large ruial
population. We believe in the con
tinuance of the present highway poli
cy wilh such improvements as will he
commensurate With our changing con
ditions and the best methods of road
construction and recommend the ex
penditure of a reasonable part of the
highway money on the so-called back
loads under State supervision.
It is imperative thai the citizens of
our State receive the best possible ed
ucational ad vantages ami that equal
opportunities for the securing of an
education be given to ail. Believing
in this principle ami that wherever
practicable the rural school should be
restored, we favor the continuance
ind extension of our present educa
tional system so that the same may
be brought to the highest possib'o
point of efficient j .
We call attention lo the marked In
dustrial progress already achieved by
Vermont under successive republican
administrations, and we declare for
the conservation of our forests and
water powers, am) for the continua
tion of the campaign of publicity tint
has been so effectively carried on.
We favor I he Immediate repeal of
the BO-called Terry act.
We believe that the present prlmar
law should be given a fair trial with
such amendments thereto as the e
perience ol I ile las' primnr.v elei 1 Ion
seems to warrant.
We favor the enlargement and SXtStl
slon of our workmen's compensation
act.
We believe In Ihe consolidation rath
er than In the creation of t miimissintis
and that the conduct of the public
biislnt is should he thoroughly elllt lenl
ami as economical as will be in keep
ing with the dignity of Hie State, ami
that the State should engage In no
new endeavors until it lias adetiiate
ly provided for those which it has a
ready undertaken.
Having endorsed the platform
piotuulgated by tin- republican nation
nl convention, we do not deem It
necessary or wise to repeat herein the
principles therein set forth. We b
llevc that n promise made should hi
kept ami to that end we urge that our
candidates lor office at the coin Inn
eh . Hon shall carry out faithfully each
anil every recommendation herein
made insofar as they may huve power
nml authority so to do. As loyal n
publicans we pledge our support to all
candidate nominated by the party In
State and natlnti and we call our party
to the standard, ronfldcnl that the re
spouse will be such as lo insure tin
triumph of tho just principles for
which we contend In both State and
nation.

ONE MAN TO HANDLE MILK
Of All the Members of the Vermont
Dairymen's Association.
Bellow's Falls. Sept. 28. One of the
largest meetings ot milk producers
ever held in this section of the state
met hero yestenlav to discuss the milk
situation. Between 60 and 75 produc
ers were present in the meeting in the
Hotel Windham. The meeting was
Btrictly confined to producers and ef
forts of two representatives of Boston
milk concerns to enter were unsuccess
ful. I'ress representatives were also
barred.
After the meeting Frank Northrop
of Ludlow said that beginning October
1. all the milk produced by the mem
bers of the Vermont Dairymen's as
sociation would be sold through him,
as the organization's representative.
The organization of the association
lias not been completed but it will
have branches in every section of each
of the New England states and will
work in co-operation With the New
England Milk i'roducers' association.
Mr. Northrop did not know how much
the local producers would receive for
their milk after October 1. but he said
that he would demand at least 50
cents for an eight and a half quart
can. delivered on the platform at Bos
ton. This means that the members of
the association. doing business
through him, will pay for their own
shipments and the nearer Boston they
are Hie more money they will receive.
IB estimated that producers loading
milk at Bellows Falls would receive,
at the rate of 50 cents a can. live cents
and a fraction for each quart of milk.
