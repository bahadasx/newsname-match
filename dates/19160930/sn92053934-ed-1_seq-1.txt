Charles Krueger Dies at St.
Anthony's Hospital
From Wound.
C.T.RAHN IS CHARGED
Confessed Slayer Hangs His!
Head When Jailer Tells
Him of Death.
Charles "W. Krueger, who hovered
near death's door for a week, suffering
bullet wound in the head, died at St.
Anthony's hospital at 5:20 o'clock this
morning.
Carl T. Rahn was held today with
out hail for murder. Chief Miller pre
ferred the charge. The complaint was
read to Rahn at the county Jail. He
waived examination.
When news reached the county ia.il
this morning that Krueger had died
Deputy Sheriff John Sexton informed
Rahn.
"Krueger d'ed a few minutes ago,"
the jailer said.
Rahn loked up from his cot at the
deputy sheriff and then dropped his
bead quickly. He paid nothing. He
had been told of the critical condition
of Mr. Krueger bfore and he was not
mrprised when informed of his death.
He had repeatedly questioned the
jailers concerning the- condition of the
man he confessed to shooting, always
8(ter for the word that his chance
of recovery was mre bright, but al
ways disappointed when told there
was but remote hope of his recovery.
Rahn Had Grudge.
"After Rahn was brought into the
Jail I talked with him." Deputy Sex
ton sail. "I asked him why he shot
Krueger. He told me he had trouble
with Krueger two years ago. He said
a year later he went in Krueger's sa
loon ithe one across the street from
where the shooting occurred and
while in ther he gnt into pome trouble
with two men. He told me that
Krueger gave him the worst of the
deal. He said:
'"I brooded over the treatment ever
since. I could think of nothing else.
When at work in the foundry I would
find my thought always turning to
ward Krueger and the raw deal he
handed me. Friday I got a fewdrlnks
in me. A mania to gt Krueger
seemed to come ovr mo. I went to his
saloon. I told Krupger there was a
debt he and I had to settle and settle
t once. I never mentioned $500 to
him. He mentioned it to me.
"'Krueger asked if Jr'"0 would
square if.
"'I said it wouldn't. There was only
one way it could be settled. I told him.
Then I let him have it and ran. I was
f.orry right away. Hut the thing had
oothered me so much I worried myselr
Hno a mania to kill him.'
"Rahn followed Krueger's condition
closely. He kept asking us continual
ly how the man was."
Of course the severity of the crime
committed by Rahn depended on
whether Krueger lived or died and his
punishment and the extent of it de
pended on the life or death of the
wounded man. Vet officials think that
he was concerned over the condition
of the saloon man more for sentimen
tal reasons than for worry over the
punishment which would be meted
out to him.
Rahn had previously been held In
bonds in the sum of $5,000 on a charge
of assault with intent to commit mur
der. When Krueger died this charge
was dropped and a warrant charging
murder was immediately sworn out
by Chief Miller in police court. The
warrant was taken to the county jail
and read to Rahn. He waived hearing
and Police Magistrate Smith held him
to the grand Jury without bail.
Death Expected.
Krueger's death was expected. When
he was removed from the Three Oaks
saloon, 401 Fourth avenue, back of the
bar which he was standing when Rahn
ranie in and shot him, he was thought
to have been In a dying condition. A
week ago today the same opinion was
held. He regained consciousness for
pells, but would always relapse Into
semi-conscious state.
The bullet entered his head over the
left eye, passed back of the eye and
lodged at the back part of the brain.
Attending surgeons had made num
erous efforts to locate the bullet but
iact location of the lead was not pos
itively known to the doctors until af
ter his death.
Krueger at the time he was shot
owned two saloons at Fourth street
and Fourth avenue. The one on the
eet side of the street he had owned
tor a number of years. The "Three
Oaks bar" on the east side, the saloon
he was in when he was shut. lie had
Ulten possession of only a few days
before the bhootlng occurred. He pur
chased it from C. C. Krocger. The
Municipal commission, only last Mon
4ay, transferred the license to him.
Mob In Dispersed.
Krueger was wtll liked in Ihe west
end of the city. He lived at oOS Fourth
treet. When news spread in the west
nd that he had been shot last Fri
day night, a mob of at least 100 li
kens was organized and a search was
'arted immediately for Rahn. The
hunt was conducted In the railroad
yards where he lay In hiding. Police
believed they prevented serious harm
to Rahn by arresting him before the
Jngry citizens found him. Patrolman
unn apprehended him.
Kabn confessed to police immediate
ly after he was taken lno custody.
