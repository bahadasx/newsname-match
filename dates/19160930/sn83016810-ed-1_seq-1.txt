THE MOTON INCIDENT.
(From the Cleveland Gazette".)
Major Robert Moton has recently
been installed as principal of Tuske
gee, Ala., N. and I. Institute. He
made a favorable impression while
here in Rochester. Everyone regrets
to know that his wife was subjected
to such brutal treatment as to be
driven out of a Pullman car in Ala
bama. It appears, according to re
ports, that the riding in a Pullman
car by the Motons had been a subject
of discussion before the journey was
begun. Mrs Moton felt that she was
clearly within her rights to ride in a
Pullman car anywhere it went The
white passengers complained of her
presence and when everything was
opportune, they depended upon the
usual law-breaking officials of Alabama
to drive a defenseless woman out of
the car, in which she could travel with
comfort and ease, into a "jim-crow"
car, where vermin dwelt. It is very
unfortunate for the white passengers
that their selfish ease and comfort
had made them snobs to the extent
that they objected to the presence of
the wife of the principal of Tuskegee
Normal and Industrial Institutethe
school that the country says is "the
colored man's finest educational
asset" Is it possible that any white
woman could be so robbed of the milk
of kindness and womanly instincts
that she would urge the driving of a
refined mother out of her berth which
she had purchased, which the com
pany had accepted the money for, in
order that white supremacy might get
another boost? Above all do we re
gret the reported statement issued by
Major Moton. He did not stand by
his wife in her fight for her rights.
He advised the submission to in
human oppression. He is quoted as
saying that he "has the highest re
gard for the traditions of the South,
he having been born there." We
commend him for his consideration
of the South, but we are amazed,
however, at his foresaking his wife in
this hour of her humiliation. We also

mission to wrong and injustice in
order to exist in the world, we choose
the former. Between Major Moton
and his courageous wife in this in
stance there is no real choice. Fair
minded men and women of all races
sympathize with and stand by Mrs.
Moton. If Tuskegee is to be con
tinued as a mill to turn out colored
boys and girls who are spineless and
cowards when their civil rights are at
stake, the sooner it goes to the wall
the better it will be for all concerned.
Great buildings, imposing machinery,
beautiful grounds and varied indus
tries amount to naught when the real
thing, MANHOOD, is crushed out.
Major Moton should understand now
that Tuskegee is a nation's school.
The millions now being sought for
from all races should remain in hid
ing if the inhuman and brutal prac
tices of the worst element of the
South are to determine its policy. If
the best whites of the South acquiesce
in it, then we say move Tuskegee
where it can develop character and
MANHOOD. The "jim-crow" car
must be fought and the time is oppor
tune to fight when one of the fore
most women of the land has been so
shamelessly humiliated and appar
ently foresaken by her strong de
fender. Major Moton's task is a dif
ficult one, but let him start right If
the advice given his brother and wife
is characteristic of what he will give
students, we quake and tremble for
colored boys and girls.

RESENTMENT NEEDED.
(St. Paul Appeal Editorial.)
After having been granted Pullman
tickets from Montgomery, Alabama to
Savannah, Georgia, the wife of Major
Roberit Moton recently
Blanto Moton his brother were
ejected from the car by "two police
men and some of the best citizens" of
Troy, Ala. Although they had paid
Pullman fares and were interstate pas
sengers, both were.forced to ride in

ored youth for life. Manhood should
be the basis of all training.
What more is needed to make a man
resentful than an attack on his wife?
A being who would not defend his wife
against every foe is unworthy to be
called a man. Even among the lower
animals the males willingly give up
their lives in defense of their mates.
The present unhappy state of the
colored people in the United States is
largely due to the servile tactics of
the so-called leaders who have been
not only too cowardly to defend them
selves when attacked but have actu
ally advised submission to great
wrongs. xv.. xviutuu,, reueuuy installed ~~T "j~o nucu

(From the Cleveland Gazette)
Four days after the inauguration as

and that is from a racial standpoint

This paper has no retraction to
make in the Major Moton affair. It

improvement was made by his pro
motion. Booker T. Washington's pal
liation gave us double work for man
hood rights not only in the South but
the North as well for untold years to

Major Moton's First Duty.
(From the New York News)
The future of the great work at
Tuskegee, may call for an offending
silence, but it will never be helped
long or to any great degree by an
abject surrender of the race's rights
Major Moton's first duty to himself
and his race is to set himself now and
at all times four square with the pro
gress of his people.
Must Contend for Rights.
(From Richmond Planet)
We do not just understand the
position of Principal Robert R. Moton
in the matter There is no
other course to pursue than to con
tinue to contend for rights denied,
even though we are rebuked and dis
appointed in so doing. No question
is ever settled until it is settled right.
We must continue to appeal to the
conscience of the American people.
We must continue to attempt to en
force our rights through the courts of
the land, even though some of them
may be prejudiced against us.
The Color Line.
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)
Major Moton is quoted as saying
that he bears no resentment against
anyone for the treatment accorded his
wife. If he were an American, he
would resent it hotly and the railroad
would pay damages. As an Afro
American he may not act on the im
pulse of self-respect and chivalry he
must cringe and submit
Unless He Can Talk Like a Man.
(From the Richmond Planet.)
Principal R. R. Moton has gone to
work. It would be well for him to
keep at it and to have nothing further
to say about that Pullman sleeping
car incident.
Servility Brings Contempt.

If the above is true (referring to
the "Moton Incident") then Major
Moton will rise to fame and fortune
s^
$2.40 PER YBAK.
Crooking the pregnant hinges of the
knee that thrift may follow fawning"
brings wealth from the great masses
of white people alright, but it also
brings a vast amount of contempt.
There is so much bowing, cringing
and nauseating servility shown by
some of our people, is it any wonder
annointed, and therefore vastly supe
that even the 25th class of white
people feel that they are the Lord's
rior to all colored people?
THE HAND PICKED LEADER.
(From the Kansas Elevator.)
The Elevator would like to know If
the time has not arrived when colored
men should select their own leaders
instead of leaving the delicate task to
the hands of designing men of the op
posite race, and if any colored man
can serve two masters at one and the
same time, and if as a general proposi
tion, the "hand picked leader" is not
always against his race?
Shun Them as Vipers.
(From the Martinsburg Pioneer-Press)
Just as long as the negro believes
"he has a place," and is constantly
jerking off his hat when out of it, he
will be the cause of many others en
during hardships forever and aye. As
long as a certain class of whites take
to this class of sycophants, the more
rigidly those who wear their sover
eignty under their own hats, should
denounce, discard and shun them as
they would a viper.
IS HE TOO, A TRUCKLER?
(From the Boston Guardian.)
It is said that Major R. R. Moton,
principal of the Tuskegee Institute,
condones the recent outrageous treat
ment of his wife who was ousted from
a Pullman sleeper in Alabama and
compelled to ride in the "jimcrow" car
because of her color.
If Major Moton is willing to con
done such an outrage it is evidence
that he is not the man to be at the
head of a great institution for the
"training of young colored men."
The first thing to be taught our
youth is manhood, for without that
they can never amount to anything,
and a man who does not resent an at
tack on his own wife is certainly not
the person to teach manhood to others.
The beasts of the jungle will fight to
the death to protect their mates.
Major Moton has recently been in
stalled as principal of Tuskegee but
it looks as if he ought to be sup
planted by a real man, who does not
"respect Southern traditions" as
Moton claims to.
