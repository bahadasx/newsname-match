Jefferson Fair Opens At
Gretna With Big Crowds
Govereor Pleasant and Mayor
Behrman Take Part in 'arade and
Make Addresses.
Opening day of the Jeffers in
Parsih Fair at Gretna was attend
by results that exceeded the ex
p..ctations of the management in
spite of weather conditions that
were not altogether favorable.
Intermittent showery had the ef
fects of delaying the start of the
parade that preceded the form -l
opening ceremonies, but did not
in the least, dampen the ardor of
the managers or the throngs that
g tthered.
Governor Pleasant, \iayoir E
hrman and other prominent visi
tors took part in tile parade aind
the speaking. The courthouse
square, just a stone's thrtuwv
from the fair grounds was dec)
rated with flags, as were the
courthouse and other buildingsii
in the vicinity. Here the parade
was formed, Chief of Police Le
son and it squad of officers lead
ing, followed by Braun's naval
brigade btand and members of I
the volunteer fire department in
uniform, dozens of automobii ,s
and carliages in line, the pro.-l
inent officials occupying these
conveyances.
An interesting feature of the
parade was the display of live
stock by Evan McCalr, There
were also a number of magnifi
centteams in the line.
Sheriff L. H. Marrero, of Jeffer 1
son parish, acted as chairman of
the reception committee, assi. ted
