: Deemed Important ; ;
That harmony among the Koreans
of Honolulu is continually being en
dangered -by personal squabbles be
tween Editor Y. U. Park and ; Dr.
Syngman Rhee of the Korean board
ing school, is the statement of a
prominent local Japanese resldent
who is in close . personal touch with
the affairs -and conditions not only
cf his own people, hut of the natives
of Korea. . - ' ',;
In a statement to the Star-Bulletin
today, which is in the form of com
ment on an exclusive story published
in this paper, on Friday to the effect
that the Koreans are subscribing to
a fund with which to "fight for tne
independence of Korea from Japan,"
this well kaown Japanese says: -
-There are two centranigures
among the Koreans of Honolulu who
are continually squabbling for indi
vidual power among their people.
These are Editor Park of the Korean
newspaper, and Dr. Rhee.' ' :
"Park is anti-Japanese in. his opin
ions, but is very ambitious. Dr.
Rhee, while an educationalist and a
Christian gentleman, ,is also anti-Japanese.
'- ' - V' '
'Dr. Rhee desires to educate the
people cf his race in this eountry to
become antl-J apanese, but Park, has
deeper theories and believes he can
train bis young fellow-countrymen
and. lead them in a fight against the
Japanese, v ' - ' - 'v.-
On August 29, last year. Park an
nounced that he was going to col
lect a "war fund for, use by his coun
try to fight Japan, and at the same
time his men were sent all over the
territory to . solicit subscriptions to
ward this fund." But according to a
report from a reliable source receiv-1
ed by the Japanese consulate, nere,
he Las only collected about $300 to
date. ' - . ' . ' ' ' . -'
-At that time Dr. Rhee. and Park
were in need of money for their own
plans and wanted to draw on a ior
tlon of the reserve fund held by the
Korean National Association. Both
began negotiations 'with the organl
xatlon toward this end. But the trus
tees of the association were in fa
vor of Dr. Rhee and t once decided
to set aside some of the fund for
Dr. Rhee's work, and this embitter
ed Park against the association, and
he and Rhee ceased to be friends, It
Is reported.
"The association finally decided to
aid , neither Rhee nor Park. Then
Park started collecting" mare war
fund fees, threatening to use the pow
er of bis press against those who re
fused to ' respond. This has ben re
ported to the - Japanese "consulat.
"The Japanese : consul general will
conduct a strict Investigation for he
thinks that Park - Is collecting the
money7 fraudulently, for .personal use
only. . - : -. - -:: '
4As a retaliatory measure Park's
name has been placed , upon the Jap
anese "persona non grata" list since
he returned from the mainland and
he is' denied the support and protec

WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept 1. It
is conceded on all sides . here that
James L. Coke will bring down the
judicial plum or persimmon, as the
case, may be. The puckering powers
of the Iruirwill. be more or less de-.
termined by the outcome of the No
vember elections. ,
Officials in the department, of jus
tice seem to be a unit in the belief
that Mr. Coke will walk off with, the
prize made available through the res
ignation of Judge T. B.' Stuart - No
announcement has been made and no
definite conclusion reached, but the
outcome Is accepted as settled.' :
v UpT to this time there have been
no protests filed against the appoint
ment of Mr. Coke. ' Neither have any
additional recommendations " " come
along in bebaU of " C C. Bitting or
C. S. Franklin. The matter remains,
as it did weeks ago, in a condition
of approximate lethargy. . : . ;

curred, cablegrams : and letters have

tion. : All : this excitement is absent
now. Officials remark - and wonder.
The giving of a-recess appointment
to Mr Coke. seems unlikely. His des
ignation is not. anticipated for a cou
ple of months. This would carry ! the
time so' near to the convening of Con
gress December 4, that it is probable
the president will wait and send in
nomination after that date. No haste
Is considered necessary, as; the Ha

Brooklyn retained : . the National
League championship by a' one-point
lead today, when.vl after losing the
morning game, 7 10. 2, the Superbe s
came back and battered the Phillies
Into submission for, a score of ft to 1.
. Rube Marquard, Jthe elongated left
hander, pitched a marvelous game for
the Brooklyn team, giving the Phillies
but three bits, while the 'Superba
were pounding the; mighty Grover
Alexander for many' hits and six runs,
Ervlng Kantlehner replaced Alexander
in the eighth, but .the ' damage had
been- done and as a result Brooklyn
is once more the, favorite for the Na
tional pennant ' . ' ' .v1-
Another of the ex-Giants figured in

Pat Moran sent Grover Cleveland
Alexander back, into the game after
one 'day's rest to cinch the last game
of the series and give the Quakers a
lead of one and. a half games before
they entered the last ' series of the
year. ; Alexander ' used all - his : cun
ning throughout and the record crowa
watched' the battle- of the pitchers.
When the Brooklyn ? team took; the
lead the crowd went wild and cheered
the Dodger southpaw to the echo. ;.
BROOKLYN, N. Sept 30.
Eppa Jeptha Rlxey Jr., of Culpepper,
Va, threw his 6 feet 5 inches of . reach
into the game this ' morning; against
the Brooklyn Dodgers, and as a result
the Philadelphia Quakers "won "their
second -straight game from the Brook
lyn squad, and thereby took the lead
ing place in the National League racel
The score was 7 to 2. - ' ; " :
It was truly a battle of Giants this
morning, as Manager Wllbert Robin

In the pinches, and as a result lost out
