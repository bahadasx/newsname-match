CONNERV GLORY
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are cltlieni who believe that
It Is contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many of the
publlo offices In one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threata made by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferrot out Just what grasp
tho Conncrys have on public affairs.
The result Is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use the United States Gov
ernment in their business.
They evidently have found the
State oMUInols,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
ing why all of tho public Jobs are not
given to Connory's.
It may bo duo to the fact that there
are not enough Lcnnorys to go around.
Connerys First!
What a noblo family motto that is
to bo suro.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Dlockl as you
may have beard him referred to, a
vartner of John T. Connery In the coal
bualuess, Is a member of tho Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the ntce-salarled
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Blockl.
Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts In which the Con
,nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the publlo Interest In them
ever wholly died out
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who held ofllce or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our files will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get tho party treason which brought
It about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that somo members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1007 when
ho was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
the light of, the Royal Family of tho
Democratic party, entitled to most,
If not to all, of the Jobs In its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so bard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.
When, John W. Ralney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for.Clork of the Circuit Court
in 1013, tho Connery outfit fought
him at tho polls In fayor ot Joseph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltser was run
ning for the Domocratlo nomination
for Mayor In 1015, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member of the
family In that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet ot Connery and the aeble Francis

D. was sent back to the payroll to
Malt for another chance.
Swoltzer got the nomination and It
Is said that the Connery following
did not forglvo him for crowding out
one ot the princes of the blood and
Were not over-enthusiastic for Swelt
iter's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is known that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law of John T. Con
nery did not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk o; rue Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, tho present
efficient Democratic Incumbent ot that
office.
Joseph F. Connery, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother ot
Francis D. Connery and an uncle-In-law
of Joseph E. Bldwlll, Jr., will seek
a rcnomlnatlon for Recorder of Deeds
Michael M. Connery, brother of
John T., Joseph F and Francis D.
may get back his former official
Job as Inspector for Attorney G on-
oral Luccy.
Henry E. Connery, brother of Mich
ael M. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Francis D. Con
nery, and 'inclo of William J. Connery
and uncle-in-law ot Joseph E. Bldwell,
Jr., will hold his present lucrative Job
as Stato Bank Examiner.
Francis D. Connery, brother of Hen
ry E. Connory, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Michael M. Con
nery; uncle ot William J. Connery
aud uncle-ln-law of Josoph E. Bid
well, Jr., will retain his presont $C,
000 a year Job as Comptroller of the
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
State Street Block!, the business
partner of John T. Connery, will not
have a chance to run- again for his
present Job on the Board of Review,
until next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew ot
John T Joseph F Francis D and
Michael M. Connery will retain hla
nlce-salared Job as Blockl's .Secretary.
But by next year a few more of
fices may be created for a few more
Connerys as It would be too bad to
havo Blockl, John T. Connery's part
ner in tho coal business running on
a ticket where there was not another
member ot the Connory family to keep
him from getting lonesome.
Connery first the rest nowhere.

GOOD SANITARY TICKET
Democratic Ticket for Sanitary
Trustee's Is'the Best Ticket
in the Field.
The Democrats made no mistake In
the ticket nominated by them for
Trustees 'of the' Sanitary District Of
Chicago. It Is above reproach. Every
man on it 'has served the publlo 'faith:
fully and well. Following Is tho
ticket:
President Sanitary District Thom

Sanitary Trustees Joseph Rushke-

Elected on His Honest and

HIh great record as State's Attorney
Is appreciated by tho people.
Ho will be re-elected beyond any
question to tho offico he has honored
so well.
Democrats and Republicans alike
are for hi in.
GOVERNOR DUNNE'S
PLATFORM.
The state executive and his friends
controlled the Democratic stato con-
vention at Springfield from start to
finish.
Governor Dunno's plutform is the
real thing.
At the last session Governor Dunne
endeavored to havo tho legislature
adopt an amending clause amend
ment resolution, removing tho pres
ent restriction prohibiting the alter
ing of more than one article ot the
constitution at a single session.
The tax amendment resolution,
which comes up for the approval ot
the voters in Noyombor, finally won
the right ofway and was adopted.
In the 1913 session tho governor
gave preference to-the inltlativo and
referendum amendment resolution,
but the conflict among Its supporters
and those ot the tax amending .clause,
suffrago and other amendments re-
WINS
suited, as usual, In tho dofat of all of
them.
Tho governor has slipped an Intla
tivo and referendum plank Into this
year's platform for the purpose of
keeping the party on record at the
coming session of the legislature.
It is the governors theory that It
Is useless to delay "pulling the cork"
simply because a now constitution
may be submitted to tho voters halt
a doyen years hence. In cbbo a new
constitution Is rejected, he points out,
the desired changes could be made
more easily than heretofore by the
amendment process.
Tho Democrats will go on record for
tho adoption of the tax amendment at
tho polls this fall.
Other propositions favored In Gov
ernor Dunno's draft ot tho platform
include:
Private bank legislation.
A shorter ballot.
Homo rule for Chicago.
f Extension of civil service In tho
state and in Cook County and the
sanitary district of Chicago.
Abolition of the state board of
equalisation and the substitution of u
tnx commission.
Reapportionment of congressional,
senatorial and judicial districts.
A corrupt practices act.
Si'imrnto elections for judges.
Rotation ot names on primary bal
lots for all offices.
Relslou of election laws to rcduco
the present enormous expense.
Development of tho budget system.
CoiiHolidatlon of stato commissions
and departments, as recommended by
tho efficiency and economy commis

CHICAGO CONGRESSMEN
SPEND MONEY
That candidates for congressional
nominations In the Illinois primaries
went tho limits so far as expenditures
are concerned Is Indicated in leports
reaching tho clerk of tho house.
Myer J. Stein, one of tho defeated
Republican candidates, spont $4,315 In
his effort to bent torlmor. t Arthur W,
Fulton, tho successful candidate, has
not tiled his after eloction account
yet, and scheduled only $00 expense
before tho primary. James McAn
drows, the Democratic Incumbent,
spent $300. Lorlmcr himself reported
$2,008.87 ten days before the' primary.
Nothing has been heard from him
since.
Congressman Madden reports nn o
pendlturo of $200; Mr, Maun. Sl.CGti;
Mr. McDormott, $1,819; Charles Mar
tin, who defeated McDormott', $1,001;
Congressman Copley, $2,431; his op
ponent, F. W. Shophetd, $1,."52.
Tho after primary roport of tho
Hontou Republican League in tho
Second dlstilct Is being nwnlte.d with
much Interest by persons who are de
sirous of ascertaining just how much
tho drjs actually expended In their
futile effoit to dofent Minority Leader
Mann, They reported Closo to $15,000
ten days befoio tho pi Unary.
TO REPEAL
PRIMARY LAW
Politicians down stato are planning
to wipe tho primary law off tho stato
books at the next session of tho Gen
eral Assembly.
In recent sosslons bills to repeal tho
act havo never got nnywhero at
Springfield, the legislators roaring tho
wrath of their constituencies In enso
politics were put back undor tho old
soap-box primary and gum-shoo con
vention system.
Tho now proposition Is to Introduce
a repeul bill with a refoicndum at
