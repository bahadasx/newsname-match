"Turtle Lady" Rather Nice,

By the Art Editor
It Is my province, from time to
time, to pass judgment on art.
I see by the papers that a Chi

art sftore, saw In the window a
new daub called "The Turtle
Lady," or something like that,
and promptly swooned.
Recovering, he pinched the art
dealer.
Chicago, the dispatches say, Is
profoundly shocked. A commit
tee of pork packers has viewed
the picture and pronounced it Im
moral.
At first blush it occurs to me
that a picture, or anything else,
that can shock Chicago must be
dreadfully wicked. But the dis
patches assure us that the lady Is

on the matter, and, while I have

Evidently the lady Is Interested
In natural history. She Is so In

of tlie fact that she has forgotten
to dress.

Duplication of an item of $60,

had caused Ihe council to brain
storm for i week, was revealed
Saturday morning by Controller
Fred Shoemaker.
The controller had not been
called into conference with Ihe
council, it was learned, and had
not even received a copy of Ihe
budget.
He was consulted Friday alter

For an entire week the council
has been working furiously to
make mil cuts which Comniis

budget, hail told t'nem would have
to be made.
The item of $.".0,000 was part
of the Interest on water depart
ment bonds. Last year the coun
cil provided that hair tlie waler
bund Interest would be paid rrom
the general fund.
But Commissioner Drake had
decided to pay al! Ihe interest

abuse of public telephones, it re

have visited stores and advised
the owners that the public service
commission had issued a ruling
demanding five-cent instruments

This statement was Incorrect,
