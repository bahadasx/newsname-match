Never in the history of this city has
it been possible for its citizens those
who dearly love high class music to
enjoy such a rare musical treat as was
presented to them last Monday evening
at Quinn Chapel, which was well filled
but it should have been filled to over
flowing, for those who failed to hear
ifnie. M. Callaway-Byron, on that
Most auspicious occasion will not hear
any one to compare with her singing
for many years to come for in all his
tory it can be truthfully stated that
there is as much difference between her
Jinjring and the singing of those so
called singers who are singing around
this city in churches for twenty-five
fiits a night or for anything that they
can pick up, as there is between the
imallest ant and the very largest ele
phant and even the so-called celebrated
onlird who boastingly claims that
lie is a star of the first magnitude will
have to go away back and learn all over
sain just how to sing before she will
ever be able to stand shoulder to
shoulder in any way with Mme. Byron.
The following was the program ren
dered on that more than delightful oc
casion which will go down in the his
tory of this city as the Losoros con
cert or the Byron recital.
Solo Pianoforte Finale from Sonata,
Greig T. Theo. Taylor; Air des bijoux
(Jewel Song) (Faust), Gounod Mad
ame Manitza Losoros; A. E lucevan
lo Stelle (Tosca), Puccini, B. I attempt
from Love's Sickness to Fly, Henry
Purcell W. Henry Hackney; Arie aus

F. Herold Madame Man
itza Losoros; (Accompanied by T.
Theo. Taylor.) (Violin obligato Mons.
Antoine C. Elgar.); A. Organ Solo
Postude in E Flat, Abernepky B. Even
Song, Kinder Walter E. Gossettej A.
Teera's Garden The Mountains of Al
lah, Henry Gcchl B. Depuis le Jour,
Charpentier C. Boheme, Alfred Gross
D. Vissi d'arte e d'amore (Love and
Music) (Tosca), Puccini Mme. Losoros,
Mr. Gossette, Mr. Taylor and M. Elgar;
Aria, Ritorna Vincitor (Aida), Verdi
Mme Losoros; Accompanists T. Theo
Taylor and little Nellie Etura Byron.
Before she made her grand and most
dashing entree on the stage or platform
she introduced an entirely new novelty,
which caused all the other singers who
were out in full force to open their eyes
real wide and her pleasing new novelty.
was simply, softly and very sweetly
singing at a distance out of sight,
"Homo Sweet Home, be it ever so hum
ble there is no place like home", to
say the leaBt with one full bound
she completely captivated the highly
appreciative audience, when she finally
emerged on the stage or platform in
all her beauty, radiant smiles and
splendor.
In the past twenty-five or thirty
years it has been our pleasure to listen
to all the most far famed singers in
this country and we do not hesitate in
saying that none of them have or can
surpass Mme." Byron, for she ran tho
whole or the entire musical scale or
range running on up to E flat beyond
high C with the greatest case and ap
parently without the least effort on her
part, which places her almost in a dis
tinct class by herself, for really and
truly she is a most wonderful singer and
any civilized race of people in the
world would be very proud of her and
her rare accomplishments and feel its
self highly honored to claim her as their
own, for there is not another songstress
in the United States belonging to the
Afro-American race that can approach
her in the slightest degree and thero
are very few soprano singers residing in
any part of the world that are her equals
or that can come within one thousand
miles (as it were) o'f surpassing her in
the high or perfect art of classical sing
ing. With no trouble on her part she can
thrill and thrill like unto the golden or
the silver voiced morning lark having
perfect control over her cnchauting
voice, her poise and stage deportment
is absolutely perfect, she is pleasing
and extremely charming and her strik
ing figure dazzles tho eyes and bewitches
those who gaze upon her.
At the end of several numbers she
very gracefully bowed herself from
the stage and when she re-appeared she
was attired in a new costume which

Dresden and Munich, Germany. She is destined to become one of the most
famous operatic stars of the present age.
was more beautiful and elegant in every
way than the one she had discarded
which was another very pleasing feature
of her high class and artistic recital.
Mme. Byron was born in Tenn., edu
cated at the Fisk University, Nashville,
Tenn., for the past sixteen years she
has resided abroad for ten years of that
time she received instructions from
three of the best and greatest teachers
of voice culture and music in the old
world, sho successfully studied in Ber
lin, Germany; Eome, Italy and Paris,
France. It was in Paris that she was
prepared for the Opera.
Her daughter little Nellie Etura By
ron, was born in Berlin, Germany, came
to this country two years ago a refugee
from Europe, she, like her mother has
understanding about musical terms that
is astounding and she is bound to make
a capable pianist.
Mme. Byron who is a songstress of
world wide fame has prior to the break
ing out of the war in the old world,
appeared in every large city in Europe,
and with the Philharmonic Orchestra of
Dresden and Munich, Germany, received
a letter of thanks from the Duchess of
Sutherland and flattering compliments
from the King and Queen of England.
Many prominent White ladies and
gentlemen attended the recital, includ
ing Madam Schumann-IIeink, the noted
and popular German-American singer
and they were all greatly delighted
and very much charmed with the sing
ing on the part of Mme. Byron.
Mr. W. II. Hackney, who sang ex
ceedingly well himself deserves to be
highly commended for making it pos
sible for tho music loving people of
Chicago to enjoy the rare treat of lis
tening to the artistic singing of Mme.
Byron.
Dr. George C. Hall, Mr. Jesse Binga,
Major Robert R. Jackson, Mr. George
T. Kersey, Mr. Dan M. Jackson, Dr. A.
Wilberforce Williams, Col. John R. Mar
shall, Col. Franklin A. Denison, Dr.

Dr. W. A. Driver, Mr. James E. White,
Dr. W. H. Marshall, Mr. Albert B.
George, Mr. Edward D. Green, and
other leading Afro-American citizens
of this city, should at once start a sub
stantial subscription fund; thereby
making it possible for talented and
highly accomplished artists as Mmo.
Byron, to hold or to give, two high
class recitals or concerts at Orchestra
Hall, twice each year.
For it must bo distinctly remembered
or understood that any race of peoplo
which fails to encourage the cultiva
tion of art, music and literature that
race of people will never leave anything
behind it, to show that it has ever ex
isted on tho face of tho broad green
earth.
