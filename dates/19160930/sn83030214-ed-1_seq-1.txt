[Bj Cifcla to T>.i Tr. .M .
London, Sept tl.*- In an effort to \
stern the British push toward the Ancre
a9)d Bapaume the German? opened a
heavy counter attack to-day in the
Thiepval sector. Hut Haig's line held
tirm and his troops succeeded in cx
tcnding their gains north of the
Somme.
Eaal of Le? Boeufs, where their ob
lertive is Sailly and the positions on
the Bethune road to the north, the
British drove back the Kaiser's troops
along a front of tive hundred yards.
Kariier in the day they had eaptured a
Btrongl-f fortified farm a quarter of a

is possible.
fiermans Hurl lona ol Shell.
From Beaurnont and Miramount, \y
ing bevond thr Anera, the (.ermans
buried tons of shell on the British po
?ihoi.s around Thiepval. But Haig's
tioops were able to take refugc in the
enemy'" old duguu's, and M clung to
their ground.
Then the Kaiser'* force* 1-tunchcd an
infantry attack. Ihe British had won
ar. important sector of the strong Hes
.riaa trench north of Thiepval. Before
the fury of the (Ierman counter driva
they had to yield it. But soon return
ii g to the attack. Haig'? troops drove
rut the foe, and then pushed beyond. In
?iiis action alone the British took rnore
than Ave hundred priaoners.

London Says Hollweg
Is Waving Peace Flag
Speech Construed as Bid for Mediation by U. S. and At?
tempt to Console Despairing People?Attack on Entente
Regarded as Manoeuvre for Neutral Sympathy.
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER.
[Hy Cable to The Tribune.1
London. Iept. St. Tn many quarters
Chaneellor von Bethmann-Hollweg .
speech rs considered essentially a bul
for mediation by America or some
other neutral power. Outwardly his
review seenn intended to arouse an 1
invigorate tha drooping _>pirits of th?
German people, who have jrown ea
pecial'y war weary aince the suecess
of the Somme offensive, but it is
prompted fundamentally by the be?
lief the time ii opportnne to wave the
peace flag.
Undoubtedly, the eentiments ex
pressed by Lloyd George came as no
surprise to the Chaneellor. He sees a
chance for Germany to gain eapital in
the eyes of neutrals if he could ir.duce
America to offer mediation and have it
spurned by the Allies, as it would be.
Then he would cry "greed" to the
neutral world, and tell the Germans
they had to choose between absolute
ruin ar.d defence to the last. Vhus he
might embarrass the Allies and
strengthen his own creaking machine.

HOLLWEG PUTS
VICTORY FIRST
"Germany's House
Burning, We Must
Put Out Fire."
Berlin, .Sc-pt. __.- "To-day. after
two years of fightintr, sf.ruggling,
-ulTVring an.l dying, wo know more
than ever before that there is only
one wahhword?persevere and win.
W. will win."
That is Chaneellor vou Ucthmann
Hollweg's answer?made before the
Reichstag? to assertioni of the
Allies that the tide is turnin*, against
Germany.
_M Chaneellor repeated once more
t-iat Germany was flghting for
"nothing but defence of her right to
life and liberty," ami that .he had
declared her readinesa for peace be-1
fore. But the Allied lust of con
quest, he added, made peace impo_
aible.
"Germany will not l>e permitted
to think of peace while her house is
buniing," be said. "She must first
extingaish the fire."
Says Defence ls Inshaken.
The Kaise. fl armies, the i.'hancel
lor declared, have built up a sue
cessful defence against all hostiie
attacks. "The situation of our faith
ful brave allies is unshaken," he
addad
"The battle of the Somme will cost
further sacrinccs. Still another
trench and another village may be
lost. but they will not tret through."
Of the economic .lituation the
Chaneellor said:
"I.ast wititer there was pusillani
mous anxiety as to whether our food
stuffs would suffice. They have suf
lieed. This year's harvest makes us
mocfa more secure than was the case
last year."
H.thmann-Hollweg made a tierce at?
tack on Great Brltaia. He declared
that country was breaking one inter?
national law after another, and was.
aho_ all, Germany "j "most egotistical,
fiercest and most obstinate enemy."
"A German statesman," he said, "who
would hesitate to use against this
enemy every available instrument of
battle that would really shorten this
war s-ich a statesman should be
hanvred,"
The Chaneellor declared his contempt
for those circulating reports that all
Germany's means of tighting were not
being employed to the fullest possible
extent. He added that in order to dis
appotat the enemy, "who is on watch
for every breach cf our inner determi
r ation." he would not give details.
This was his answer to his critics at
home.
The Chaneellor said he realized the
troubles of the people coincident with
the war and thut he shared the deep sor
row for the fallen and mutilated. "I bow
my head," he went on, "before tht
heroism with which women and men
without distinction of rank or cla.s
bear their sacritices, united in an ard
ent love for the Fatherland. Still
more sublime and still greater is the
detiance of death with which our sons
and brothers in the tield withstand the
viclent assaults of the enemy. who,
supenor in numbers, are fl.hting with

bassador Walter H. I'age of the senti
m?nt among the Allies.
Mr. (ierard should reach New York
by the middle ot the month. Then the
President can decide whether it is
iriflflt to contine his preelection re
marks to the question of a league of
nations, which would cause no excite
BBOat among the Allies. though it would
command their respeetful attention,;
or to breach the dangerous aubject of ,
medistion. It is hoped here the Lloyd j
George Interview will forestall the re?
ported plan of the President, but th-j
earnestness of the people in their
tremendous job makes them fearful of
wall intentioned but misguided inter- i
ference.

"If, however, aa the above mentioned

that the Kntente Allies have an immense
