Kvery section of Kansas is to be a

who are to be turned loose on the state
next week. Both Republican and
Democrat state committees today an
nounced speaking dates for next week
and no section of the state is to escape
the vote hunters.
Goernor Capper will, next -week,
begin a two weeks' automobile tour of
the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh districts.
He will travel 2,000 miles on his trip,
which is to be the most extensive and
spectacular campaign trip stayed in
the state in the same period of time.

H. Sessions, Republican state chair
man, of dates lor Governor Capper
and other campaign orators. Hubert
Lardner. chairman of the Democrat

Bryan. The Commoner comes to the
state October 9 and 10, for nine
speeches in the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh
and Eighth districts. Both state com
mittees will make the western ter
ritory the battle ground next month.
It is in the western half of the state
that the Democrat congressmen seem
to hold the greatest strength. But a
fieht in the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and
Eighth districts, does not mean that
the territory comprising the Second
and Fourth districts both Democratic
under 1914 returns will be over
looked. Wilson Won't Come.
Efforts of the Kansas Democrats
to bring President Wilson to Kansas
in October failed today when final
announcement was sent to Chairman
Lardner by Vance McCormick, nation
al chairman of the Democrat com
mittee. The. president .will visit Omaha,
in October. In view of his visit to
Kansas in February, however, he de
clined to come to the state for

New British armored tractor charging a German trench.
The London ttispatcheg daring the past few weeks have contained glowing accounts of the activities of
new engine of destruction which the British army has just adopted. The weapon is a giant armored motor,
car, equipped with a battery of from eight to twelve rapid fire guns. The employment of the caterpillar type of
wheels enables this car to travel over even the roughest country at "high" and its heavy armor makes it in
vulnerable except to the heavier artillery. The pictuie drawn by an eminent artist, from word pictures of
the monster, shows it charging a trench, an occupation at which it has proved remarkably effective.

Battling for first place in the National
league pennant race, and in all likeli
hood for the championship, the sturdy
men of General Patrick Moran de
feated General von Robinson's Brook
lyn Dodgers in the morning game here
today and went to the top by the nar
row margin of a few points. -
Superior pitching of Rixey enabled
the Phillies to take an early lead
which they held thruout. Pfeffer
was ineffective at critical times and
his support also cracked considerably
when the strain was applied. The
Phils piled up two runs in the first
two innings, and from the time they
first put their scoreboard in operation
they were never in danger of being
overtaken. The last hope of the
! Dodgers died in the sixth inning when
I Luderus poled out a home run that
gave nis learn a iiiitr-rijii iu.

Apparently afraid that the fresh
men would make too good a showing
against his regulars. Coach Kennedy
switched the varsity lineup for the big
free game on Washburn field this
afternoon at the eleventh hour, plac
ing Captain Stewart at fullback and
Perry at half, Benton going into the
line at guard.
Everything wis in tip top shape for
the contest and Coach Kennedy an
nounced that the teams would appear
on the field shortly after 2 o'clock, the
game starting at 3. It was planned to
make many substitutions in both line
ups so that every man who has shown
any kind of prospects could get a
chance
Dr. "Pete" Heil was the referee for
the game and Stahl, of K. S. A. C,
was booked to umpire. "Pinky" Beals
was chosen as head linesman and Doc
tor Kennedy himself was on the list
as field judge. Ideal weather and the
fact that no admission was to be
charged insured a good crowd.
FRESH VICTORIES

Henry, D. Estabrook of Vew

Public Trouncing of Wilson
Administration Here.
CROWDS FROM OUT OF TOWN
Xearby Towns Wrill Come to
Meeting, a la Ford.
Adamson Bill" Will Be of Inter
est to Topeka.
Henry D. Estabrook of Xew York,
one of the most able men on the
stump for the Republican national
committee, will tell Topeka and Shaw
nee county voters of the issues in the
presidential campaign when he speaks
tonight in the auditorium. Esta
brook's speech will be one of the fea
tures of the Republican campaign in
the state and a big crowd is expected
to hear the Xew York lawyer.
Kansans who know Estabrook ex
pect him to administer-a public spank
ing to the Wilson administration. He
is known as a sharp tongued, sarcastic
and able orator and Topekans who are
waiting for a real indictment of the
Wilson administration do not expect
to be disappointed. Because of the
large organized labor vote in Topeka,
it is probable Estabrook will discuss
the- Adamson eight-hour bill and other
labor measures. He will also discuss
the tariff and foreign policiea of- the
Wilson administration.
Estabrook is in reality a western
man and knows the Kansas language.
For a number of years he was a law
yer in Omaha. From Nebraska, he
went to ChicatJ. Later he was sent
to New York, where he is now chief
counsel for the Western Union Tele
graph company. Last spring Esta
brook was a candidate for the Repub
lican nomination for president. He
maintained headquarters in Chicago
for several weeks and made an active
campaign. Before the opening of the
campaign, however, he withdrew from
the contest.
On Tour of the West.
In the Hughes campaign Estabrook
is making an active fight. He is tour
ing a number of western states and is
probably one of the most able orators
to be sent to Kansas during the pres
ent campaign.
Large crowds are expected to attend
the meeting from neighboring towns.
Announcements ha-e been sent to To
peka to the effect that Rossville
Maple Hill, Silver Lake, Dover. Valen
cia. Wakarusa. Meriden and other
towns will be represented by automo
bile parties which will drive to To
peka in time to the hear the New
Y'orker speak. The meeting will be
gin at 8 o'clock. The -Santa Fe Ap
prentice band will furnish music. John
S. Dean, of Topeka. president of the
Republican league of 1912, will pre
side at the meeting. Dean, Judge C.
W. Smith and D. W. Mulvane, former
national committeeman, have heard
Estabrook's speeches at meetings of
the national bar association and are
willing to vouch for a hot one at to
night's meeting.
Estabrook will come to Topeka at
7:30 o'clock following a meeting in
Hiawatha this afternoon. A commit
tee composed of Charles M. Sessions,
state chairn-.an. Hiram P. Dillon. D. W.
Mulvane and John Chaney, will meet
Estabrook when he arrives in Topeka
tonight. Arrangements were made to
day for a dinner party in Estabrook's
honor. -
Kstabrook will spend Sunday in To
peka. He will speak Monday Vfter
noon in Iola and Monday night in
Chanute. Tuesday afternoon he will
speak in Junction City, leaving on a
Tuesday night train for Colorado,
where he will campaign for the Re
publican state and national tickets.

London, Sept. 30. British losses in
September were at the rate of more
than 3,800 a day. Casualties on all
fronts reported in this month were:
Officers, 5.4 39; men. 114.110.
Heavy as were the British losses in
September, they were lighter than
those of August, which were 127,945,
a daily average of 4,127. In July,
the first month of the Somme offen
sive, the losses- were about half those
of August or September, notwith
standing the fact that in July the Brit
ish stormed the first line German de
fenses. The casualties in that month
were 59.675, so that the total for the
three months of the Somme drive is
307,169..
Germany Estimates ICnemys Loss.
French and English press dis
patches report that considering the
character of the fighting, the losses
of the allies on the Somme are low.
An official British statement of Thurs
day said the British losses in the pre
ceding few days had been "small, not
only relatively to the importance of
the gains but absolutely. This is at
tributed largely to the increased ef
fectiveness of the artillery.
German reports dwell on the large
losses with which it is said the allies
are meeting, which are declared to be
out of all proportion to the ground
gained.
The Overseas News agency estimates
that the combined French and British
losses in the Somme battle up to Sep
tember 15, amounted to about 600,000.
Since January 28 the British govern
ment has Issued no figures- of total
losses.
Up to that time daily . average of
tosses irom tne Beginning or the war
was slightly more than 1,000.
.. Altho the casualties at. the present
are about, four times those of the first
sixteen months of the war, this in
crease is due not only to the offensive
operations now in progress, but to the
fact that Great Britain's forces In the
field are far larger than in the earlier
period of the war.

Roosevelt's Advent to Michigan
a G. O. P.OIoose Reunion.
Parade IVith 26 Bands, Barbe
cue, Too, Precede Speech.
(The lotscriit Kdition of the State
! Journal will carry a complete account
i of Roosevelt's speech to be delivered
at 4 p. m.)
Battle Creek, Mich., Sept. 30. Colo
nel Roosevelt came to Battle Creek
today to inject seme ginger into the
presidential campaign. He said so
himself. He is to speak late this aft
ernoon at an old-fashioned barbecue
and rally on the circus grounds under
the auspices of the five surrounding
counties.
When the train pulled into Battle
Creek an hour late, because of a stop
at Marshall, Mich., where the colonel
gave some school children a "straight
United States' lecture, it looked like
a good part of all the five counties
were on hand to give the ex-president
an old-time welcome. There
were fully 30,000 ac the depot and 30.
000 more along the route of a parade
that was held before the colonel had
time to wash his face and hands.
Roosevelt said coming here on the
train last night that he intends mak
ing "a fighting speech" this afternoon.
Some members of his party who have
read the address said he would do it
all right if he sticks to the text.
Has "Real Fighting Speech,"
The colonel did not really figure on
the stop at Marshall. Folks on the
train probably did not realize the
quiet, rather paunchv person who sat
reading a history of Ireland in the ob
servation car, was really Roosevelt.
But the minute the train slowed down
at Marshal!, Roosevelt jumped to his
feet, grinned his teethy smile and
went to it. with all the old Roosevelt
tactics that infect crowds with the
cheering serum.
Roosevelt reviewed a monster pa
rade immediately after arriving
twenty-six uniformed bands and all
and then took a two hours rest
after lunch. He plans to leave here
about 9:30 this evening for New Torle
On his way back he ajid Ralph I
Cole, chairman of the speakers bu
reau from Republican headquarters,
will decide how many more speeches
he will make for Candidate Hughes.
The matter of a coast trip also will be
settled.

now and was looking for a house
keeper a voung housekeeper. No, the
clerk couldn't help him any. The vis
itor left a shotgun which he carriea
in a case and a grip with the bell boy
to take to the room, and started out to
look for a housekeeper. He stalked
out of the hotel southern military
style, with his gray hair protruding
from under his hat, a strange contrast
to his moustache which was dyed
black.
He Found a tiirl.
According to the story he told Mc
Govern. he found a housekeeper a
mere slip of a girl and "by gad, she
was pretty."
The girl offered to go with him and
be his housekeeper If only she had
"something to wear."
Thirty minutes more saw the
Cheney visitor and the girl -walking
out of a department store. The girl
clinging to a new silk dress and affil
iated paraphernalia that the Cheney
man didn't know the names of.
They went back to the hotel. The
clerk was keeping the shotgun behind
the desk. The man paid his bill and
asked for the gun, asking the girl to
hold it while he went to his room after
his grip. She assented.
When he returned the girl had dis
appeared. The shotgun lay in the mid
dle of the floor. The Cheney visitor
looked around for her and then called
on Detective McGovern in the police
station. He described the girl.
McGovern had heard ' of her in
fact every officer in the station had.
The Cheney.: visitor was. a,ngrvv He
"didn't care anything about the girt,
but he wanted that dress back even

McGovern left the station on a
sleuthing expedition The Cheney
man promised to wait at the hotel.
McGovern found the girl.
Then he tried to find the complain
ant. The .hotel clerk smiled. "No,
Mr. S wasn't there. He had left
for home. He had left word for Mc
Govern to 'never mind.' '
