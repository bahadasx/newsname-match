Study of this vital problem shows
hat the great bulk of the fire waste
ad its attending evils is the result
« f individual carelessness, that fire,
ike di ease arid casualties, can be
greatly reduced by watchfulness,
cleanliness and proper regard for the
rights of others, and that correction
of these calamities lies primarily in
education.
Therefore, in order to bring about
a better understanding of this prob
lem and to awaken our people to a
vivid sense of the dangers of the fire
ar.d of carelessness, I, R. G. Pleasant
Governor of the state of Louisiana,
do hereby proclaim and designate
Monday, October 9, 1916.
the forty-fifth anniversary of the
great Chicago fire,
"Fire And Accident Prevention Day"
and 1 earnestly urge that our people
! observe this day by a general clean

Let hospitals, asylums, factories,
theatres, hotels, and all other public

Let the municipal officers through

Lastly, let a period be set aside in

Given under my hand and seal of
