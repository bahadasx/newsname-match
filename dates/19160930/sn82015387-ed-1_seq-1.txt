water thereby made inexpensive gives
a cleanliness and sanitary perfection

stood: 'Mackie, 154; Anderson, 153.

'Mr. Sidney Fuhrmann has disposed
of his bottling concern and will de
vote his entire time to the Parkview
Theatre. He intends to make quite
a number of improvements in connec
tion.with the theatre, both as to the

convenience of the theatre. The
placing of electric lights along the

is much appreciated by the public
and adds to the illuminated effect of
the theatre in the evening. In fact,
Now Hampshire and Boston streets,

Mr. Fahrmanz is looking to the

O. L. D. PHAR
MER'S LETTER
Farm Demonstrator Lewis
Tells What an Experi

Explains the Difference Be
tween That and a Dem

Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
Dear Sir:-To show the absence of
understanding of some people in this
-parish of the demonstration work as
carried on in Louisiana and in other
Southern States, I am giving you for
publicatiion the letter handed me by
you some few days ago. The writer
of this letter does not sign his name
and this letter ordinarily should not
be published, but for good reasons I
want it published in full, which is as
follows:
St. Tammany Parish, Sept. 1, 1916.
Editor St. Tammany Farmer, Cov
ington, La.:
'My Dear Editor:-Will you kindly
investigate the shortcomings:4f the
Experiment Station on the Military
Road at the old Voss place and pub
lish in your columns the findings of
your investigation for the benefit of
the farmers who are expecting to de
rive some knowledge from the experi
ments and to put into pra.tic:.l use
'any scientific methods which may be
ishown to be beneficial to the farmer
and to the parish. The farmers of
the parish have been looking for a~
crop report of this statitn ever since
it was established.
This is the kind of stuff the poor
farmer are paying a high tax for.
It has been stated that the pace is
under the supervision of Captain
Lewis, who is undoubtedly receiving
a fat, juicy salary. Who pays his
salary? I will tell you. The poor
farmer-by being taxed outrageous
ly. The Captain is supposed to be
possessed of a large amount of in
telligence but the farmers who were
to 'be benefitted when the C iptajin
put chis knowledge into practical use
and could show the practical farmer
wherein he had erred in tilling the
soil and not reaping the maximumi
harvest are still waiting to be shown.
It asppears as though the Captain is
lying on the poor farmers legs. The
experiment station now has the ap

A TRIP TO THE
HOULTONS AT

Stumps, Conducted With

and Equipment,
W, A. Hood, E. J. Domergue, J. P.
Rausch, G. C. Lewis and D. H. Mas6n
visited the farm of the Houltons at
Uneedus, last Tuessy. Some photo
graphs were taken o fioels.and barns
and bungalows, and./I th.y rove to
be good will appear .te .Farmer
in a later tssue.
The Houltons are toyyl ihosts.
Everything was done to make the
visit pleasanit and the w~ants of the
inner man were not neglected. The
dinner was not only delightfully pre
pared, byt the surroundings of the
bungalow dining room. the conveni
ence of its appointments and the 4iar
mony of the general arrangements
and architecturaZ designs, in keeping
with the local resources of nature in
timber and other products, made the
meal a wonderful example of how the
ingenuity of pnan may bring the luxu
ries of civilization and culture to the
home on the farm as well as into
the mansion of the metropolis. -And
then the studious attention to service
made it impossible that guests should
mi s being served with any of the
delightful things that were so boun
tifully spread upon the table.
W'hile the Houltons are bachelors,
their bungalows are a perfect dream
of comfort and orderly arrangement,
being in charge of a housekeeper who
knows how to handle all the -little
details that make up the whole of
comfort and order and food appear
ance. A notable part of the bunga
low is the sitting room. It is finish
ed in stained pine, ceiling and walls
being paneled, each panel bearing
some trite inscription cut into the
wood. Each guest room has a pri
vate bath, with hot and cold water,
and each is handsomely furatshed.r"
Mr. Charles Houlton was in Nef
