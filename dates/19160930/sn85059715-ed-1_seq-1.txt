FOR HIS FALSE STATEMENTS
And Challenges the Democratic
Nominee for a Discussion
of the Record.
CHARLESTON. Sept. 30?Reply
ing to a communication addressed to
him by B. N. Oxley, of Charleston,
a representative of John J. Corn
well, Democratic candidate for gov
ernor. In which request was made for
an Itemized statement of telephone
calls for the governor's office, as well
as the governor's mansion, for the
month of July last. Governor Hat
field has taken ocasion to challenge
Mr. Cornwell to a joint discussion of
the record of the Hatfield adminis
tration.
"Mr. Cornwell has made false
statements about many acts of mine
as chief executive of this state and
has criticized my administration. I
shall he very glad to discuss with
him the record of my administration
before as many audiences as he de
sires, and to permit the citizens of
the state to conclude as to my official
actions. Now, ir Mr. Cornwell wishes
the record of my administration let
him for once allow fairness to take
the place of the strong partisan in
clination and misrepresentation that
have attended his every effort in this
campaign, as well as his unsuccessful
campaign of 1004 and meet me
squarely upon the Issue that he has*
seen fit to raise." This was the
defy laid down by Governor Hatfield
to Mr. Cornwell.
ItesenU Inquiry.
In his reply to Mr. Oxley's request
for detailed information of all tele-!
phone calls to the governor's office,1
as well as of the governor's mansion,
the governor declared that he "re
sents not only the making of such an
utterly improper request, but the un-j
fair insinuations which are Implied
in ihe making." He expresses sur-|
prise that Mr. .Cornwell's representa
tive does not also seek -information
as to the other details of his domestic!
arrangements, such as the amount
of his grocery bill, etc.
Governor, Hatfield makes It plain
in his reply that in the expenditure
of the contingent fund as well as
any other 'fund over which he might
have control, the constitution pro
vides that he shall make '/?tailed
report to the legislature, ^and to
that body a strict accounting will be
made at the proper time," he declar
ed. #
In expressing his contempt and
surprise over the receipt of such an
Inquiry as that which has come froin

man you claim to represent?to
whom I am In no way accountable and

? Wilson is an Enemy of*
; Labor, Says Socialist:
* Presidential Candidate *
?r
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 30.?"The 400,000 trainmen who are
praising President Wilson for giving them an eight-hour day because
they held a club over his head have received a beautiful package
tied with pink ribbon aud sealed with bright red wax. IJeforo that
eight-hour law becomes effective on January 1, Congress will again
act upon it and a supreme court that is sphinx-like in character will
have passed upon it, too. You know what will happen to it
"With the bill Wilson tacked on a recommendation that Con
gress pass a compulsory arbitration law, and such a law sounds the
death knell of labor unionism. Wilson pretends to be the friend of
labor, now that he needs the votes of working men, but in reality he
is an old enemy of labor."
In these words, Allan L. Benson. Socialist candidate for the
presidency, dealt with President W llson in two addresses before 2,500
enthusiastic men and women here.
