Great Battle Develops on East
ern Front Between Lutsk
and Valdimir Volynski.
London, Sept. 29. Greece's entry
into the war on the side of the entente
allies has not yet been announced. An
unofficial dispatch from Athens gives
the text of the proclamation of a pro
visional government in Crete by for
mer Premier Venizelos and Admiral
Coundoriotis which declares that if
the king should decide not to take the
lead of the national forces "it is our
duty to do the needful thing to save
the country from ruin." '
MYTILENE JOINS REBELLION.
Athens, Sept. 29. The local loyal
officers and soldiers of the garrison in
Crete wbo arc said to consist of a
third of the Greek force on the island,
have requested the entente allied con
suls to provide means for their return
to Athens.
The island of Mytilene has joined
the Venizelist movement, all the local
authorities having.placed themselves
under the "committee of national de
fense," established in Saloniki.
NAVY IS UPSET.
The ddifarture from Atliens of Ad
miral Coundoriotis besuTes causing a
deep impression on he king, has
completely upset the navy. The Greek
battleship Hydra and two torpedo
boats have left the. anchorage with the
Gtcek fleet and joined the entente al
lies fleet in Salami's bay.
The king Called a conference of
Premier Kologeropoulos, General Mo-
schopoulos, the chief of stiff; Rear
Admiral Damianos, the minister of the
marine, and Nicholas Strathos, ex

taken in view of the silence of the
entente powers respecting Greece's
proposal to join the allies, made
through the Greek minister at the en
tente capitals ten days ago.

TOM MCGEHEE
ARRESTED
Alleged Slayer of "Dick"

Caught In Muhlenberg.
Elkton, Ky., Sept. 28. Tom Mc
Gehee, charged with killing W. H
Wells, at his home on Rabbit Ridge
Monday afternoon, was arrested at tie J
home of his son, Dillard Mcuehee, at
Vancroft, Muhlenberg' County, by
Deputy Sheriff W. T. Clardy and H.
T. Mcintosh, of the county, and Chas.
WicklifFe, of Muhlenberg, and brought
here and lodged in jail. His examin
ing trial is set for dctober 7. The
killing has created intense excitement
in that section of the county.
McGehee claims that he acted in
self defense and that the dead man's
father, Ren- H. Wells, started the
trouble by cursing and abusing him
and his grandson, Taylor McGehee,
as soon as they appeared at the Wells
home, where, according to McGehee,
they had gone to fire some tobacco
raised on Wells' place by Taylor Mc
Gehee. He says that Dick Wells soon
appeared and taking a shotgun from
his father's hands, began shooting.
He claims one shot struck him before

RAINED ON
THE
The Last Day's Session Was
Marred By Inclement
Weather.
FAIRVIEW TRIP LEFT OFF
Meetings Thursday Were
Held In The Avalon, Where
Dinner Was Served:
Following a brilliant reception at
the Elks Home Wednesday night, the
Orphans Brigade concluded its ses
sion Thursday.
The last day was marred to some
extent by heavy rains. For this
reason the expected all day visit to
the birth place of Jefferson Davis, at
Fairview, had to be foregone, except
for a brief visit paid it during the af
ternoon by some of the veterans who
were especially interested in it.
At noon the dinner which had been
prepared by the ladies of Hopkins
ville and which .was to have been
served at Fairview, was spread at the
Avalon.
The vim and spirit evidenced . by
the old veterans was a subject of gen
eral comment here. They walked
about the streets and paraded with
martial step and bearing. One of the
number, T. J. Jeffries, who is eighty
four years of age and who served
with the 24th North Carolina infantry,
demonstrated his nimbleness by
standing on his hands at his hotel.
The reception Wednesday ' night
was a very enjoyable affair. Mrs. P.
E. West, the president, and other la
dies of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, were assiduous in their
attentions to the old veterans, who
were present. Many citizens attended
to show them every honor and cour
tesy. Delicious ice cream and angel's
food calio were served.

BEARD
CASE
l$MD
Went to the Jury Yesterday
After Two Days
Hearing.
VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY
The Indictment Against Ern
est Wilson, Col., For
Murder, Is Dismissed.
The case against Geo. S. Beard,
charged with obtaining money under
false pretenses from Miss Mabel
Maddux and others in a contest con
ducted for the Hopkinsville Kentuck-
ian in August, 1914, was begun Wed
nesday and the following j'ury from
the regular panel accepted by both
sides without challenges:
Jno. T. East, Lewis Hamby, Leon
ard Fuller, G. H. Major, B. F. Mc
Kinney, II. M. Cornelius, J. M.
Dollins, F. M. Dulin, GusK. Stephens,
John Murphy, Ira Harris and W. P.
Ward.
The trial was entered into Thursday
morning anuargument was begun by
the attorneys at 11 o'clock yesterday.
The Commonwealth introduced
Mrs. C. F. Shelton, to whom the first
prize in the contest, an automobile
valued at $523, was awarded by
Beard, the contest manager, following
a count of thc votes. She elected to
take $500 in cash in lieu of the car and
was paid that amount. She did not
remember how much money she
paid in.-
Chas. M. Meacham, proprietor of
the Kcntuckian, stated that he em
ployed Beard to conduct the contest
on a commission and that after award
ing the car to Mrs. Shelton, Beard
failed to account for $300 the voting
slips turned in showed she had paid to
him. He took Beard's receipt for
the amount due him also the shortage
and attempted later to adjust it with
him in a final settlement, but never
did. Beard never accounted to
him for any part of the $300 and
when Miss Maddux complained to
him, he set aside the award to Mrs.
Shelton, although $500 had been paid
to her, and gave Miss Maddux the
automobile. He also returned sever
al hundred dollars to other contest
ants and satisfied all complaints. Mrs.
Mable Boyd Anderson, T. L. Morrow,
E. G. Shelton and L. J. Maddux, were
other Commonwealth witnesses. The
defendant entered a general denial of
fraud and claimed that he turned over
all money collected.
The court instructed the jury to
consider the question as to whether
Beard had obtained money under
false pretenses, regardless of any
subsequent settlement of Beard with
Meacham.
Frank Rives, attorney for the de
fense, spoke for one hour, taking the
ground that the evidence was insuf
ficient to conviet and pleading for his
acquittal.
Commonwealth's Attorney Smith
spoke for the prosecution after the
noon vacation and the case went to
tho jury at the conclusion of his
speech and at 4 o'clock a verdict of
not guilty was returned.
The following cases have been tried
or disposed of this week:
