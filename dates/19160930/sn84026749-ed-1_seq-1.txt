WHAT 10 DO
WITH
ANGEUNI IS PUZZLE
FOR II. S.
Italian Who Went Insane at
Leavenworth Held Illegally
at St. Elizabeth's.
TO MAKE HIM D. C. CHARGE
There Is no question facing the United
Slates Department of Justice today
which Is half'so troublesome as that of
what to do with Angellnl.
The Department has found that Ernest
Angellnl, an Italian, Is held without
warrant of law In the criminal ward of
St. Elisabeth's hospital, and, though vio
lently Insane, cannot be held there
longer without recommitment.
Complicating the situation Is the fact
that tho District eovernrrlent cannot Is
sue legal papers Justifying the United
States In holding Ansrellnl at St. Elisa
beth's, because, rightly or wrongly, he
now is a cnarge or tne rcaerai uovern
ment and not a ward of the District.
As a solution of the problem the uu
reau of Prisons of the Department of
Justloe Is seriously considering a plan
or. turning Angeuni loose irom oi. Eliz
abeth's, although he Is violently Insane,
so that he can be rearrested and his de
tention be'made legal.
Police To Be on Guard.
To guard against the escape of the In
sane prisoner. If this step should be de
cided ,on, the police will be notified In
advance, ad that Angellnl may be cap
tured outstdo the gates of the hospital
Deiore.ue lias opporunity to escape, na
become a peril to the community.
A..iT..llnl .., Cfwvnpii Iti W'tri'nnklri
to serve h year and A half at Leaven- 1
worm penitentiary ior uiihk wio wn
to defraud. Two weeks before his
sentence expired he became violently
Insane over the prospect of liberty.
Officials put him under observation,
but he became worse.
Leavenworth prison officials obtain
ed an order for his detention as a
maniac, but they held him at Leaven
worth until after his sentence, with
good behavior allowance, had expired.
Then they sent him to Washington as
a prisoner at St. Elisabeth's.
On investigation, the Department of
Justice concluded Angellnl is held
illegally as he no longer was a Fed
eral charge when his term expired.
Problem for Officials.
But officials were puxxled what to
do about It. They were not sure he
could bo sent to Wisconsin, the State
from which he was sentenced, as he
was not stricken with Insanity there
and properly was not a charge of that
State. He was not a resident of Kan
sas, the State in which he went in
se.ne, but an Inmate on Federal terri
tory there. While at St. Elisabeth's,
although in the District of Colum
bia, he is In a Federal institution and
r.ot properly a chaarge against the
District.
Attorney General Gregory and Cor
poration Counsel Syme are In consul
tation today over the case with the
prospect that the ruse will be adopted
of making Angellnl a District of Co
lumbia charge by turning him at large
In the District, thereby giving the Dis
trict government officials legal au
thority to hold a perfunctory examina
tion and Issue orders for his recommit
ment to St, Elizabeth's as a legal
charge of the District.
Frost Will Be On
Pumpkin in Morn
Get Your Overcoat and Furs Out
of Moth Bags, Cold Wave
Coming.
Washington Is to get Its first real
"cold snap" of tho season tonight.
Prof. Bowie, forecaster at the Weath
er Bureau, declares there will be a reg
ular rip to the air tonight and early to
morrow. The temperature, he says,
will fall to 33 or 40 degrees, Just a lit
tle above the freezing mark.
The Weather Bureau Is giving a frost
warning to all horticulturists In and
around the District of Columbia, wheth
er they be back-lot experts or real
farmers.
Tomorrow, the forecast says, will be
fair and cool, a fine day for a stroll In
woodland or the country, and the
"frost'll be on the pumpkin" In the
morning.
Monday, according to the present out
look. It will commence to warm up a bit.
In the meantime, however, It might be
well to get the old overcoat out on the
lino to air.

Morgan Sails to
Float War Loan
Wall Street Expects Quarter Billion
British Flotation to Follow
Financier's Trip.
NEW YOnK, Sept. 30.-J. P. Morgan
sailed for England on the American
liner New York at noon today, to float
a new quarter of a bllllon-dollar British
war loan, according to reports In finan
cial circles here, Henry P. Davison.
Morgan's partner, has been In England
for several weeks, presumably arrang
ing details of the loan, which Is to be
secured by collateral consisting mainly
of American securities.
Morgan was accompanied by his wife
and two daughters.
At the offices of J. P. Morgan & Co.,
before the banker sailed, It was said
his trip was "mostly for pleasure."
The fact that II. P. Davidson and A. M.
Anderson, head of the Morgan bonding
department, are In England, added
strength to the belief In financial circles
that announcement of a new British
loan will follow conferences In London.
The new loan, If floated, will como
as a climax to three weeks of bull ac
tivities on the Now York Stock Ex
change, started, according to tho ac
cepted belief of Wall Street, In order to
develbp a sentiment of optimism and
DrosDerltv amoner investors such at
would facilitate placing the new Brit
ish bonds.
During the past few months the
American public has taken $50,000,000
Russian bonds, 1100,000,000 French notes,
IM.000,000 city of Paris bonds, and 1250,
000,000 British collateral notes. The
loan which Morgan Is now said to be
negotiating would Increase tho total do

He holds that since the Adminis
tration of Abraham Lincoln the Re
publican party has been provincial.
It has. figuratively speaking, be
lieved In closing up America and
having a good time Inside.
On the other hand, the Democratic
party, the President will attempt to
show, has locked outside tho house

by James Irwin. Jr., head AV a
private detective agency, that Joseph
C. Graveur, who was shot and killed at
the Hotel Walton, early Wpdnesday
morning at the same tlmo Mrs. Mar
garet Ilelzer's life was ended, and Mrs.
Joseph C. Le Due was wounded, have
brought about the most startling devel
opments In the case.
According to Irwin, the dead man had
been under suspicion for months as
being responsible for two robberies
which occurred In the home of his sis
ter, Mrs. Francis Apmonn, and for the
disappearance of a numlper of motor
cars from his garage.
In all these Instances, Irwin declared.
Graveur filed claims for damages
against tho companies with which
burglary Insurance was carried.
Irwin described Auspicious happonlngs
In connection with tho conduct of
Graveur's garage. lie aald at least one
motor car had been lost In a fire, two
stolen and never recocrcd. and several
more taken which were afterward
found, but not until Graveur had com
pelled a cash settlement for them.
Convinced that something was wrong,
Irwin declared that tho Insurance com
panies Anally banded together In nn
effort to corner Graveur. Tho fatal
shooting put a stop to their Investi
gations. Graveur Arrested.
Of the two robberies at Mrs. Ap
mann's home, Irwin said they followed
shortly after 4he man had taken out
Insurance on his goods and the woman
on her effects.
The first robbery resulted In the loss
of Graveur's own Jewelry, valued at
J2.000. Ho nied a claim for $2,0W. After
an Investigation the Insurance adjust
ers became convinced that he had taken
the Jewelry himself. They caused his ar
rest, but were unable to prove a case
against him, ana no was atierwara re

At tho time of the second robbery at

"Bremen" Life Belt
"Planted" for Joke
Preseryer Set Afloat Off Portland,
Me., to Create Sen
sation. POUTUAND, Me., Sept. 30. A Zep
pelin bomb would have caused but little
more excitement than did the finding
of a life preserver marked "Bremen" on
the shore of Cape Elizabeth by fourteen-year-old
Frederick Lelghton.
Frederick was calmly paddling it home
when bystanders shouted the name. Of
fers to buy the canvas ring frightened
Frederick so that he ran to Fort Wil
liams. There an examination showed that It
was undoubtedly a clever plant made
up by sensation-seekers. Little stock is
placed In Its being from the missing
submarine. '
Each side bore the name "Bremen,"
a German coat of arms and the words
"Schutzmark" (trade mark). It was said,
no North German Lloyd liners carry
the name of the vessel on life belts, and
that a close examination reveals signs
that it was a "plant."

Battery A of the Field Artillery,
which wjll leave Monday over tho
Southern railway, starting from
Rosslyn, Va., will travel to El Paso
by way of Chattanooga, Memphis,

These orders are being sent by mall
and are expected this afternoon or
tomorrow.
The in members of Battery A wero
ready today to entrain for El Paso.
All of tho battery's cannon .caissons,
and bags of harness have been loaded
on flat cars at Rossln. Two freight
cars have also been loaded with other
equipment and Impedimenta which tho
battery will, need In the field. It la
probablo that the battery will also take'
with It the thirty horses which It now
has.
Artillerymen have already packed tip
their personal equipment, and a few
moments after the orders to entrain
nro received they will be ready to
march to Rosslyn. Notwithstanding the

First to Receive It. ,
The District militia Is the first or

nnd the effect of It will be watched
with interest by the surgeons.
The ninety-five recruits for the
First Separate Battalion were sorely
disappointed over the announcement
that the colored troops on the border
had been ordered home from Naco,
Ariz.
The handful of recruits left at the
mobilization by the First Separate
Battalion on July 4. worked most dili
gently to recruit the battalion up to
maximum war strength so that the
organization might have the glory
of being the only one In the regular
or volunteer army of 1918 to present
