Several more milk dealers are expect
ed to follow suit
The notice of the Mi.xihell Co. reads:
"For the past 9 years we have been
selling our pasteurized milk for 9 cents
per quart During that time our milk

cents a pint; certified milk, 15 cents a

CLEVER WOMAN
THIEF.' ASSERT
LOCAL POLICE
Accuse Black-Garbed Girl
of Many Thefts in Bridge
port Schools.
When the name of Ruth Corbin was
called in the local court, this morn
ing, a slim' girlish figure, dressed in
deep mourning, wearing a sailor
black picture hat, -vhich seemed to
accentuate the blondness of her hair,
falteringly stepped 4b the bar, to an
swer to a charpe tf larceny.
In appearance she was anything but
the dangerous criminal and klepto
maniac which the police assert her
to be.
Her arrest, according to the author
ities, solves the mystery of the elus
ive "Woman in Black," who for more
than two years has robbed the dress
ing rooms In the various public
schools of Bridgeport and adjacent
towns, stealing from the coats of pu
pils, money and valuables.
Mrs. Corbin, who resides at 476
Broad street and says she is 28 years
of age, although she seems much
younger, was arrested yesterday after
noon, following the theft of about $8
in bills and silver from tho coats
of a dozen pupils m the Shelton Nor
mal school. '
It appears that last Thursday a girl
who has been identified as Mrs. Cor
bin, heavily veiled, visited the Frank
lin school in Nichols street She in
quired when found walking about the
building for a teacher, located in an
other school. After her disappear
ance ten graphophone records, the
property of a pupil, were missing.
The heads of the various schools
were notified to be on the lookout for
the alleged thief. Yesterday after
noon, a woman answering Mrs. Cor
bin's description, was seen In the hall
days of the Shelton school, and dis
appeared following the theft of the
pupil's money.
The police allege that on leaving -the
Shelton school she went directly down
town to the Prospect school and po
litely inquired of the principal, S. P.
Williams, who asked for whom she
was looking, if a a certain teacher
was located in the building.. He told
her the teacher was located at another
institution. His suspicions aroused,
he followed her. Instead of leaving
the building she went to the third
floor of the school. The authorities
were notified while the principal de
tained the girl. Detective John J.
Flynn arresting her. ,
Mrs. Corbin, according to the po
lice, has a mania for stealing. Twelve
years ago she was arrested for theft
and was discharged from the employ
of a local corset company for stealing
coupons from other girl employes.
Her case was continued until next
Tuesday. She was unable to obtain
her release by furnishing a bond of
$200.

Stratford's Despot Frankly
Exploits His Qualifica

Charles H. Peck, of Stratford, can
didate for justice of the peace. Judge
of probate and stata representative in
that town, is the "acknowledged lead
er" to whom Stratfordltes "may come
with their grievances and troubles to
be righted."
Judge Peck himself acknowledges
his leadership. In addition, he pauses
for reply, and as yet has heard none,
after hurling this question at the pop
ulace of Stratford:
"Is there any other man in the town
that has shown any better qualifica
tions for leadership?"
The Judae assumes his most popular
role, that 4f the political violet, in a
friendly letter of advice to Stratford
ltes on how they shouM vote in the
town election Monday. The Judge
puts his official seal of approval on
the the following candidates:
Dr. Rollin A. Curtiss, for selectman
the finest selectman we ever had."
Martin Knapp, for selectman-
'worthy of your confidence in every
way.
Clifford B. Kearney and George Ash,
for registrars of voters "the opposi
tion has had the registrars long
enough."
Oscar Swansdn, for
man in this town better qualified.'
The judge, after presenting his
cheice for office, then says about lead
ers ana leaaersnip:
"There is something more than can
didates involved in this election
there is the question of standing by
your leader. The Republican party.
which comprises two-thirds of the vot
ers of the town, have, time and again.
elected me as Its leader, and, in the
recent caucus were unanimous in con
firming; my leadership, and you should
give your'thelp at the polls. Whom
will yon follow? Is there any other
man in the town that has shown any
better qualification leadership T In
every large ana growing community,
there should be some man that should
be the acknowledged leader, and to
whom the people may come with their
grievances and troubles to be righted.
and if you can find a man better

"Now, please take no offensex at this

that Saunders take down the Red
Cross flag as he had no right to use it

few years ago and tried to get persons
interested In the incorporation of the
