when he invaded Kandiyohi county

lation, today. He delivered the state

congress as he succeeded in doing,
Nelson claimed. For the purpose of
notoriety he claimed, Wilson began
at the outset of his administration
the custom of delivering in person,
orally, messages to two houses of con
gress In joint session.
"All other presidents, save Wash
ington, have been content to send
their messages in writing to congress**
said Nelson. "Not so with Wilson.
By such an oral message he inaug
urated his tariff legislation and by
such rah Oral message he urged and

Bitterly Attacks.
"Whenever there was friction in,
the,spnate or house among Democrats
in regard to the president legislative
program, the matter would be re
ferred to a Democrat^ caucus and
the decrees of the caucus became the
decrees of a United States Democ
racy. Under tljjs method congress
has been in session two years, seven
months and. fifteen days of the three
years and, seven months that has
transpired of President WilsonV
term.**"*'
Nelson here made" a bitter attack
against the special session of congress
and the new tariff legislation. Ha
cited what he alleged to be destruc
tive features in it.
Democratic claims were then pick
ed up on the forks of Nelson's silver
tongue, and rolled around and
around. He got a laugh out of the
crowd by his satirical reference to
Democratic claims of "keeping the
United States out of war." Nelson
continued:
Claims Ear-fetched.
"President Wilson has certainly
not kept us. out of war in Mevico,
which seems to be still pending. Ha
has had his two wars there with
Huerta at Vera Cruz, and with Villa
in northwestern Mexico, more re
cently. I do not, however, at this
time, care to enter into a discussion
of his vacillating and erratic Mexican
policy.
"The claim that President Wilson
has kept us out of war with the bel
ligerents of Europe is most far-fetch
ed and ludricious and would really do
credit to Mamehausen. European
powers have their hands full battling
each other, and are too busy among
themselves to invade this country.
And this country is so wretchedly
prepared that the best we could,' do*
was to send a few thousand soldiers
in(o Mexico. .The trujth is European
powers couldn't! get at us, nor we at
them. The only war the president
has had on his hands has been a dip
lomatic war and that has been car
ried on by him with no credit or
glory to our country."
Democratic legislation was the
next thing at which Nelson took some
severe whacks. Currency legislation,
the federal reserve act, the Interstate
trade commission, the fljfiild laborw
law, the shipping law, the nitrate"
plants bills, canal bonds, Philippine
legislation/ the rural credit legisla
tion and &he Adamson bill were- se%
vefSly criticized.
