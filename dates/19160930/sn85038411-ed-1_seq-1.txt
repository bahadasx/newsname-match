Grand Jury Again
Recommends Erection
of New Courthouse

close of September quarter sessions
to-day once more recommended the
construction of a new courthouse for
county and city uses. Similar recom
mendations had been made in June

ness. It does not compare favorably
with courthouse nnd county buildings
in other counties."'
The grand jury in addition to rec
ommending a new courthouse, boosted
the jail and almshouse and commend
ed the boards and officials in charge
for their efficient management of both
institutions.

Teutons Beaten Off by New
British Division With
Heavy Losses
The Rumanian invasion of Transyl

Hermannstadt region, some twenty
miles north of the Rumanian., border,
acording to the Berlin headquarters
statement to-day. A victory there
over strong Rumanian forces bv
troops under General Von Falken
ha.vn is announced.
General Yon Kalkenhayn is one of
the most noted of German military
commanders and was chief of the.
general stuff until recently when he
was displaced by Field Marshal Von
Hmdenburg. To-day's mention of his
name in the official statement is the
first intimation thr he was in active
service in the field.
The tact that a general of such
note has been given command in
Iransylvania apparently means that
an important campaign in this Aus
trian territory is under way. A new
Teutonic offensive successfully press
ed there would place Rumania be
tween two tires, as large forces of the
central powers in the field in the
southern Rumanian province of Doli
