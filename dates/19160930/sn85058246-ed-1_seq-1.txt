INTERVIEW ON
ELECTRIC LIGHT
SITUATION
Mr. Inch Says His Company Can
Supply Power and Light Cheaper
Than Municipality
Tho letter from General Manager C.
A. Grocsbeck of tho Utah Power and
Light Co., to tho city commissioners,
suggesting negotiations for tho pur
chase and sale of tho City Municipal
Electric Light Plant, which was pub
lished In our last Issue, reveals the
tact that the plant Is inadequate and
suggests the thought that perhaps It
would bo to tho best Interests of tho
city to dUposo of tho plant. Tho
(act that the plant Is Inadequate Is
something that everybody knows, but
the matter of salo Is a different ques
tion, and something upon which
Judgment must necessarily bo defer-
ed until tho facts aro made known
through careful investigation.
Mr. S. R. Inch, operating mana
ger of tho Utah Power nnd Light
Co., was In our city on Thursday and
wo took occasion to nek him to en
largo somewhat upon the communi
cation from tho general manager of
lil:i company and to bo moro specific
ns to why he thought It to the best
Interests of Logan City that tho
plant ho sold. Mr. Inch replied
that on general principles, ho felt
that his company could save monoy
for Logan City from tho fact that
the production of electricity was tho
sole object of the corporation which
ho represented, and that ho felt that
whllo his company could not farm as
economically as tho farmers, could
)int handle general merchandise as
economically as the merchant and
could, not handlo the general affairs
pertaining to a municipal govern
ment ns well as olTlclals adapted to
tho work, he was positive that In tho
production of electricity his company
could beat the western world. Con
tinuing, Mr. Inch said :
"Wo havo reason to bellevo that
tho City of Logan Is -losing consider
able monoy overy year In tho opera
tion of Its electric light system. Wo
know that tho present municipal plant
Is in bad physical condition, as Is, of
course, only to be expected, when It
Is remembered that this plant has
been in operation somo twelvo years
or moro, with no extensive repairs
on It during that period. Tho pres
ent city plant is In no condition to
servo properly the demand for elec
tricity' in Logan and last winter, as
overyone knows, wo not only car
ried our own load In Logan, but a
considerable part of tho load normal
ly carried on tho city plant. Logan,
Is growing rapidly, and If tho muni
cipal plant cannot now take caro of
ono half tho demands for electricity
In tho city, it Is evident that as tho
city grows Its ability to take caro of
Us own electrical needs will becomo
less and less. Even to maintain Its
plant In condition to servo Its pros
ent customers efficiently, . largo
hmouuts of monoy will havo to bo
spent for repairs. Beforo such ex
penditures aro mado, It seems to us
that tho municipal officials and tho
citizens of Logan would find It do
slrablo to consider all phuses of tho
situation, and If thoy decldo to do
this wo bellevo that wo can show
them that wo can tako caro of tholr
needs In a way satisfactory to nil
concernod.
I understand that tho commission
ers, whllo In no way committing
themselves, are, novortheloss, of tho
opinion that tho situation Is ono that
merits caroful consideration nt this
tlmo.
It is vory unfortunate that, duo to
things which occurred yoars ago In
Logan and with which tho Utah Tow
or & Light Company had nothing
whatever to do, somo unfavorable
feeling still exists In Logan towards
tho Company. This, I nm suro, Is
duo to misunderstanding,
Logan, llko every other city In tho
Intormountnln country Is dopendont
for its prosporlty not so mnch upon
Industries. within tho city Hself as
upon tho prosperity of tho surround
ing country. In, Logan this means ag
ricultural prosporlty. The Utah row
er & Light Company has boon a con
siderable faotor In building up, dur
ing tho past four years, tho terri
tory adequate electrical servlco nt
reasonable rates. An cramplo of
this Is the Lewlston Hear Lako pump
ing plant which will bo Installed next
spring and which will provldo n de
pendable water supply for thousands
of acres of land. Pumping lnstnlla
lions In tho Horseshoe Bend District
will help tho farmers thero, while
lovcral other large pumping Installa
tions near Lognn which aro now un
der consideration, should bring under
cultivation thousands of acres of land
not now farmed at all which In turn
will, of course, react favorably on
Logan City.
Regarding municipal service, wo aro
furnishing nearly nil tho towns and
cities In tho northern half of tho I
stnto, and tho pleasant relations Hint
exist between us and tho pcoplo In i
tho communities which wo servo, I
should Indicate to the people of Lo--gan
that they can bo suro of good '
treatment, good sorvlce, reasonablo '
rates, and a square deal from tho
Utnh Power & Light Company. j
Our claim that we can serve Lo-j
gan ns wo are serving Salt Lnko, Of-1
den, Provo and many other cities In
tho stnto, moro advantageously than
tho City of Lognn can operato Us own
electric system, Is, wo feel, nt least
worthy of tho careful consideration
of tho people and their Jopresenta
tlvcs. Wo trusL that such considera
tion may bo given us, and that no
ono will Jump at conclusions In re
gard In regard to this matter until
tho limitations of tho present city
plant shall bo thoroughly understood
tho economic questions Involvnr thor
oughly discussed and tho advantages
of tho depondabTo and adequate ser
vlco which wo offer, carefully consid
ered." Tho claim of Mr. Inch to tho of-
'fact that h's company can servo Ixj
gan ns It Is now sorvlng Salt Lako,
Ogden, Provo, and many other places J
'moro advantageously than Logan can
onorate Us own electric system is im
portant, and wilt nt onco bo question
ed by a great many of our citizens,
it Is a fact, however, that a great
many of our citizens nro on one oldo
and n great many on tho other sldo
of the question somo bellovlng that
ttio plant Is a big paying propo'rlllon,
whllo others bellevo tho oppoBlto. It
would appear that sooner or later tho
matter should bo decided, at lcaht In
tho minds of a majority of the tax
payers, bo that something substantial
and far reaching can bo dono. If as
Mr. Inch suggests, It Is not paying,
and his company can caro for us
cheaper than wo can enro for ou
selves, then tho plant oupght to bo
sold. If on tho other hand, tho city
can best operato Its own system to
Its advantage, then certainly the plant
ought to bo ljicroased and made thor
oguhly adoquato. If It Is a good
thing, we ought to havo moro of It.
Undor the conditions, It would seem
advisable that tho matter bo consid
ered and Investigated In all Us phas
es, nnd then submit It to tho pooplo
for tholr final determination and set
tlement, n
