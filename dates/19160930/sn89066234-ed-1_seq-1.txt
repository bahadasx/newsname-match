The Kicker has received Pryans I to be willing to Increase his prof
Commoner for September and, to
one who understands how to take
it, the stuff in the Commoner is
both interesting and amusing. It
.illustrates the charneter of man
who may become "prominent" in
capitalist society.
In mentioning the aeheve
ments" of the Wilson administra
tion. Mr. Bryan says "it is a re
cord without a parallel.' The e
liar feature about this statement
is its truth. The highest mark
touched by any former adminis
tration was the "billion dollar
lnr congress." The congress just
adjourned made it near two bil
lion dollars.
Curiously enough. Mr. Bryan is
mum about this. He says nothing
about the surrender of the gov
ernment treasury to the muni
tion makers and war lords.. Mr
Bryan is a pacifist and could not
easily harmonize such action with
his "Prince or Peace" chatauu.ua
lecture.
Nor does Mr. Bryan mention
the recently enacted conscription
law among the "achievements."
In England, under a king, and in
the midst of the greatest was'
the world has ever known, con
scription raised a howl that was
heard around the world. Put

that nullifies the law. On its face
the law appears to prevent the

fully conceals the Joker, which
provides that this law does not
apply to goods manufactured for
more than 30 days! Why did Mi.
Bryan conceal so important a
fact if he is honest? The Mil
waukee Leader, edited by ex-C'oti-
gressman Burger, says:
"Tito Collection of Humorists

long session under the dome of
the national capital, played a
bright, practical joke on the
working children. It Is so funny
; that ad hell must have laughed

This congress p issed a child
labor law. it passed this law
only after yean of lobbying
what the railroads want, and
that is what the president prom
ised them. The president also
promised that any increased cost
of operating expenses might be

the Democrats have done lor xnr
common people, l hope you wont
faint when I tell you that the
first great achievement he men
tions is the Democratic tariff I
Mr. Bryan doesn't say that this
new wrinkle of a tariff is entirely
satisfactory, but assures us that
"it has lessened the power or the
tariff barons to exact tribute
from the public' He doesn't say
how? But anybody can get the
meaning who buys at the store.
The second groat achievement
t.f the Democrats, according to j
Mr. Bryan, is the income tax. We ,
have been 15 years getting this
law. it is an amendment to the
national constitution and bad to
be sanctioned by the legislatures
Of two-thirds of the states. Sua
Republican states as well as Dem
ocratic otoil its adoption. But
alter it was in effect two years,
it was found that the tax was
being shamefully evaded, and an
effort was made to remedy this
by enacting a publicity law.. BUT
COMUIKSS VOTED IT DOWN I
The third good thing the Demo
crats did was the regional bank
ing system. Mr. Bryan says "it
breaks "Wan Stree's despotic
hold." Yet the head and front of
this system is Wall Street. Ask
the cotton farmers of the South
what the "Cotton Pool" dit to
them two years ago? All of you
who have been benefited by the
regional bank, hold up your hands
Next comes rural credits. The
farmer will be poked full of this
nuxt month. The Kicker told you
something about this law a few
weeks ago. Mr. Bryan says "it is
a fitting companion to the re
gional bank law." I guess that is
the truth.
Fifth, Mr. Bryan tells us that
the working man has been taken
care of by the Clayton law, and
lie tells us this just about a weeK
child-labor illegal. It was sup
posed to be aimed directly at the
cotton mills of the south and the
canning factories of the north.
"Now it is discovered that
someone played a joke on the
children by slipping in an amend
ment providing that the law does
not apply to products that have

days. All that a manufacturer
' has to do to get his laugh out oi
the law is to store his goods d.)
days before shipping. No matter
if ho robbed the cradle for his la
bor power the taint is removed
alter 80 days."
There is nothing in the Demo
cratic record or which the devil
himself would not be ashamed.
No doubt we will again bo told to
"God Bless Wilson" for keeping
the country out of war. Wilson
did nothing of the kind. It was
an aroused public that refused to
stand for it. Ask your congress- lose much
man how ho was smothered wun not stop
letters and telegrams protesting
against war'.'
Hasn't Wilson twice tried to in
vade Mexico, and hasn't ho got
our army there now? Didn't
Bryan quit his post because be
saw that Wilson was needlessly
trying to plunge us into war with
Qerniany?
Why is Mr. Bryan now so quiet
about those eventful times? The
ultimatum" to Germany that lie
refused to sign as secretary of
state, has never been made pub
lic. Why does not Mr. Bryan tell
us what it contained that caused
blm to quit? The note that was
sent and made public after Mr.
Brvan quit containing nothing
more serious than the previous
one wnicu ur. oryan uui -
Thus I have given you a brief
review of Democratic nchiev nients
if any Democrat thinks I have
not been fair, he is entittloJ to
free space to show up my unfair
ness. It is what Mr. Bryan calls

And on this we agree.

corned. He is now also a "friend
of labor. But he was also one
of the federal judges who robbed
the striking Danbury hatters of
their little savings and their
homes, because they instituted a
boycot against their masters.
As governor of New York Mr.
Hughes proved his friendship for
the railroads by vetoing the -
cent fare law enacted by the leg
islature, and he proved his loyal
ty to all Big Business by his Oppo
sition to the income tax. There
is nothing in his record to indi
cate that he has any sympathy
for the masses. Mr. Rockefeller

"Labor cannot bo property un

exercise of power. The onl.v way
to possess labor is to possess the
men. THAT MEANS SLAVERY."
Sure it does, Senator. We So
cialists have been telling you this
all along. The men who must de
pend upon others for a chance to
work, we call "wage-slaves."
And we are sustained by the
highest courts in the land.
It makes it a little awkward
for our capitalist "friends of la
to have to admit the truth,
but there is no way around it.
The courts have handed out thu
raw goods. No misbranding or
adulteration. Labor is the only
tiling the average worker has to

WHY AUK PEOPLE BLIND 7
There ure some things so plain
that is seems the blind ought to

more hopeless than the physically
blind. The postoffiee is the big

a loss, the people gladly pay it

get an annual two weeks' vaca

A railroad is a public highway.

SOCIALISM AND EQUALITY
By John Spargo.
No Socialist wants to pull down
the strong to the level of the
weak, the wise to the level of the
less wise. Socialism does not im
ply pulling anybody down. It
does not imply a great plain ot
humanity with no mountain
peaks of genius or character. It
is not opposed to natural Inequal
ities, but to man-made equalities.
Its only protest Is against these
artificial Inequalities, products
of man's Ignorance and greed. It
does not aim to pull down the
highest, but to lift up the lowest ;
It does not want to put a load of
disadvantage upon the strong
and gifted, but It wants to take
oft the heavy burdens of disad
vantage which keep others from
rising. In a word, socialism Im
plies nothing more than glvlns:
every child born Into the world
equal opportunities, so that only
the Inequalities of nature remain.
Stick to the unmuzzled Kicker.
