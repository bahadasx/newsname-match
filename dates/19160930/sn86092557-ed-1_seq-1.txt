(Special Correspondence.)
CHARLESTON', W. Va.. September
29?Replying to a communication addressed
to him by I). N. Oxlcy of
Charleston, a representative of John
J. Cornwall, Democratic candidate for
governor, In which request was made
fortui Itemized statement of telephone
calls for the governor's office, as well
,V. is. the Governor's mansion, for the
month of Jnly last. Governor Hatfield
today took occasion to challenge Mr..
Cornwell to a joint discussion of the
record of the Hatfield administration.
- "Mr. Cornwell ban made false statements
about many acts of mine as
chief executive of this state and has
criticized my administration. I shall
be very glad to discuss with him the
record of my administration before as
many audiences as he desires, and to
permit the citizens of the State to
conclude as to my official actions.
Wow, if Mr. Cornwell wishes to drstruss
the record of my administration
let him once allow fairness to take
the nlace of the strong nartisan inctn
atlon and misrepresentation that has
attended his qyery effort In this campaign,
as well as his un>(iccesRful
campaign In 1904 and meet me squarely
upon the Issue that he has seen (It.
to raise?' This was the defiance laid
down by Governor Hatfield to Mr.
Cornwall.
In his reply to Mr. Oxloy's request
- for detailed Information of all telephone
calls to the governor's office as
well aa to the Governor's mansion,
the governo:- declares that he 'Tesents
- not only the asking of such an utterly
Improper request, but the unfair insinuations
which are Implied In the makrv
tag." He expresses surprise that Mr.
Corpwell's representatvle does not al_aeek
Information .as. to the -other
details of his domestic arrangements.
^ tfhch as the amount of his grocery
bill. etc. Governor Hatfield makes It
S?" plain In his reply that In the expendlip.
ture 0f the contingent fund as well as
any other fund over which he might
have control, the constitution provides
p that he shall make detailed report to
.? the Legislature, "and to that body
a strict accounting will he made at
gS: tho proper time," he declared.
SJS In expressing his contempt and
j?" surprise over the receipt of such an
Inquiry as that whlrh has come from
*; Mr. Oxley. Governor Hatfield Rays:
J ' "Such a request coming from the man
you claim to represent?to whom I
. ' am in no way accountable and whom
C' -the people of the state have not yet
given any warrant of authority over
. their affairs?Is In keeping with the
campaign of misrepresentation and unjust
insinuations that is lielng con
5 ducted by him In the vain hope of
" misleading and tricking some or thp
people- thereby hoping to make pos?l&>',
bio his election."
X The Governor goes Into detail to
-j show that his personal expenses dur<
tng his term aB Governor 1r less than
- $1000. He calls attention to gross mls5";/
representations of Mr. Cornwel! con>
cernlng the amount of his contingent
iV fund, and further that the contingent
fund expenses for general purposes
|fi. have been less than the general exfc
{tenses of the Glassrock admlnlstrn-rtlon
for a similar period., He challenges
Mr. Cornwell to point to a state
whose chief executive has spent an
amount less than Governc,- Glasscock
or myself "
, Senator Cornwell has declined to de.bate
with the Governor. He gave out
statement here tonight in which he
said "I see Governor Hatfield has taken
advantage of a letter written to
him by General H. B. Oxley. without
5 even my knowledge, to say a few
things about me to offer to meet me
I"and to discuss the record of his administration
and to "permit" as he sava.
' the citizens to conclude as to my official
action." My time Is too much
occupied with the campaign to undertake
to assume the burden of securing
for the governor audiences before
; whom to defend his administration and
U to the citizens' concluding as to his
official action. 1 think they have already
reached a conclusion."
Governor Hatfield's reply to Mr. Ox.
ley's communication Is as follows:

Very respectfully yours
B. If. OXLKY."
In reply I wish to state that this
1 request, involving as It does informs-;
i linn of an official character that ought1
] not properly to he made public, and'
I also of an intimate personal kind is'
; received by me not only with surprise i
! but witii contempt. Such a request
: coming from the man you claim to i

the state have not as yet given any i
warrant of authority over their affairs I
? is in keeping with the campaign of;
misrepresentations and unjustified in- j
stnuation that Is being conducted by
him in the vain hope of misleading
nnd tricking some of the people, thereby
hoping to make possible his elec-'
lion.
In the expenditure of the Contingent i
Fund. the Constitution provides that!
I shall report to the Legislature of the |
State, and to that body a strict accounting
will be made at the proper
time. My expenditures are also audited
by the State Accounting Depart- i
ment. which department is vested with :
this authority by the Legislature. |
T resent not only the making of,
such an utterly improper request, but
the unfair and underhanded insinuations
which are implied in the making.
But after having such a request from!
you at the Instance of th0 Democratic j
candidate for governor I am some-'
what surprised when the request is:
not also made for a detailed statement j
all telephone calls that have been'
made to and from the mansion?my
home?and that Mr. Cornweli does not
wish to know the other details of my
domestic arrangements, such as the
amount of my grocery bill and what J
paid for various articles of wearing
apparl during that period.
For your Information permit me to
say to you that my personal expenses
during the past year, so far as the state
was concerned, have been nothing.

not to hold the rally last night but- vS
to combine tbe two and give the one ..$H
