LONDON, Sept. 30.—The Manches
ter Guardian, strong liberal organ, to
day reproved War Secretary Lloyd
George for his statements to the
United Press and took occasion in its
editorial criticism to urge a more
detailed and concrete authorized ex
position of allied alms.
The Guardian is the first influen
tial paper in England to withhold ap
proval of Lloyd George's 'declaration
that the war must be carried to a
"knock out" and that neutrals must
not intervene at this time.
"To reject all conversation with
neutrals is a sign of violence and
weakness," said the Guardian. "Such
rhetorical ministerial excursions may
cost many lives. Llyod-Goorge's lan
guage appears' that of passion, rather
Hi»i» inducing clear theories. We
can't agree with him that time doesn't
'count in this war, when there is a
daily roll of from 2,000 to 3,000 dead
or wounded."
The Guardian declared Lloyd
George should ooncern himself with
only military affairs, letting the pre
«ler?«M foreign secretary conduct
the foreign affairs of ..the nation.
The newspaper added that it iiras not
necessary for Lloyd-George to repu
diate offered intervention and such
a proposal' before 'it was made, de
claring that there is no reason why
Britain should not be willing at the
,proper time to listen to suggestions

BERLIN, Sept. 30.—Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollweg met with the
budget commission of the reichstag
today in a secret session that will
have a most imporatnt bearing on
the future conduct of the war.
The chancellor faced members who
have criticised him for his alleged
failure to wage more energetic war
on England and men who still advo
cate a resumption of vigorous sub
marine warfare. Supported by a re
newed outburst of editorial opinion
ami by attacks on American neutral
ity appearing in yesterday's papers,
they pressed the chancellor for more
explicit plflHges than were contained
In his reichstag speech on Thursday.
On the outcome of this conference
will depend whether Bethmann-Holl
weg*s opponents wiU continue to
wage open war on him when the
reichstag reconvenes next week.
Though several newspaper critics
attacked the chancellor for failing to
outline more specifically the govern
ment's intentions toward England in
his reichstag speech, these senti
ments were not shared by the ma
jority of his reichstag opponents.
They realised, they said before to
day's conference began, that the
chancellor was speaking under the
greatest difficulties, with hostile
newspapers waiting to pounce on any
utterance and misconstrue it to suit
their own ends.
The chancellor's supporters were
confident that in a frank talk in pri
vate with the reichstag commission
today he would silence the attacks of
the majority of his critics. -.¥-

MAKES APPEAL
TO YOUNG MEN
President Wilson Sounds Call
for Them to Join Demo
cratic Party at F&ll
Election.
POINTS TO HIS
No War, Bigger Pay and Increased
Opportunities Are the Facts
Before the Country
Now.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
ASBURY PARK, N. J., Sept. 30.—
President Wilson -late today will
sound a call to the young men of the
country to join the democratic party.
In a speech at Shadow Lawn, to
be delivered to 2,000 representatives
of the Young Men's League of Demo
cratic Clubs, the president will clear
ly define what he believes are the
.real Issues of the campaign. Upon
these Issues and the administration's
record in handling them, he will base
his appeal for substantial support
from that voting element represent
ing the rising business man of the
land.
The United Fress Is able to outline
authoritatively and' In detail on what
bases the president believes he should
be returned to office.
He holds that since the administra
tion of Abraham Lincoln the republi
can party has been provincial. It
has, figuratively speaking, believed
in clbslng up AmericA and having a
good time inside.
On the other hand, the democratic
party, the president will attempt to
•shoW, has looked outside the house In
which the United States Is enclosed
—has seen there the tremendous
world trade awaiting at our doors
and has acted to properly meet that
market By Implication,, if not by
direct interrogation, the president
may be expected in his addresses of
the next few weeks to ask the re
publican candidate what he would
do in case of his election, to change
the foundations already laid for this
trade.
The president believes he has
established a policy of international
intercourse, anj change in which
might prove of vital consequence to
the future peace of the nation. By
Implication, if not directly, he may be
expected soon to question the repub
lican nominee as to what changes his
party would make in the foreign
policy.
In the president's opinion his ad
ministration is an "open book" re
quiring no exploitation because, it
speaks for itself. He believes, how
ever, that the people, if they are
asked to denounce his policies, are
entitled to specific information from
Hughes as to what the republican
party wouid do should it be placed
in power—what would be its definite
changes In the tariff what would be
its policy toward Mexico how would
it act in the Mexican embrogllo and
what would it do with the Adamson
eight hour law.
Not what would the republican
party have done, but what would it
suggest doing now, is what the presi
dent will ask. Until these answers
are given, the president may be ex
pected merely to explain what he
hopes his administration may accom
plish through its acts—not to dwell at
length on the achievements them
selves. The attitude of the adminis
tration toward business has been one
of assistance and the result unprece
dented prosperity, the president
means to show.
No war, bigger pay, and increased
opportunities are the facts before the
country now, he believes—and he will
put it up to his political opponents
to show how tfcey would change this

EL PASO. Texas, Sept. 30.—Pan
cho Villa and his forces are encamp
ed at the properties of the four Amer-,
[lean owned mines near Cusihuiria
chic, following Wednesday's battle
with defacto troops, according to the
latest reports received here today.
Carranzista authorities claim two
victories for defacto troops, but de
.talls of Wednesday's fighting receiv
ed iby United States secret service
agents here Indicate that both op*
posing forces had retreated and
that the battle was without result.
Led by Villa himself, a detachment
of three hundred VillistaB, said the
report, attacked "Casi" Wednesday
and captured the town with but lit
tle bloodshed. Part of the garrison
revolted i&nd joined the bandits. The
others, including the offlcers, were
given an opportunity to join the Vll
llstas and when they refused were
flogged and sent back to tell General
Trevino at Chihuahua City that Villa
had captured the town. The officers
fleeing from "Cusl" carried word to
General Ramos only a few mileB dis
tant. He immediately attacked the
town with a force of eight hundred
men. Villa hastily withdrew into
the mouth of a nearby canyon and
set a trap for the Carranzistas. As
the defacto forces followed the ban
dits into the canyon they were met
by a heavy fire from machine guns
and mowed down. Ramos hurriedly
withdrew his troops from the canyon,
reformed and marched away to Santa
Ysabel.
Representatives of the American
owned mines here doubt if Villa will'
taolest the properties as from all in
dications the bandit leader has ap
parently changed his attitude toward!
Americans.
