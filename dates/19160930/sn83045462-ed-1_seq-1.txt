PRESIDENT WILSON
HAS STRENUOUS DAY
Reviews New Jersey Regiment
Just Returned From
Border.
WILL TALK TO MEMBERS
OF DEMOCRATIC CLUBS
Summary of His Campaign Attitude
Hade Puublio?Flays Han He
Characterizes as "Disloyal."
i LONG BRANCH. N. J.. September 30.
' ?President Wilson's program for to1
day 1b the busiest arranged for him
* since he came to Shadow Lawn. This
morning he reviewed the 4th New Jersey
Regiment of Infantry at Seagirt,
N. J., and this afternoon he will receive
and address members of Young
Men's Democratic Clubs from Now
K York.
The New Jersey regiment recently
returned from the Mexican border, and
because of this fact the President felt
a particular Interest in it. He reviewed
the command on horseback. The review
took place in front of the "little
White House," occupied by the President
when he was Governor of New
Jersey. Representatives of the democratic
national committee arrived here
early today to complete arrangements
for the reception of the young democrats,
tr\ anHva ftn DTVApla 1
trains' at 3 o'clock.
The visitors, it Is planned, will march
in military order from the railroad
station to Shadow Lawn, a distance of
a mile, led by two bands. The President
is prepared to speak to them at
4 o'clock. It is understood that his
address will deal with reasons why
young men should vote the democratic
ticketIn
subsequent addresses here he intends
to give the country the definite
reason why he is asking for another
term.
Summary of Campaign Attitude.
# Following is an authoritative summary
of his campaign attitude.
^ The President will adhere strictly to
* his determination not to enter into
personalities or into a political controversy
with Charles E. Hughes. All the
speeches he will make away from
Shadow Lawn will be delivered before
ron-partisan organizations and will be
devoted entirely to a discussion of public
questions. By inference they will
have a political effect. His speeches
here, however, will be more political in
tone.
At present American voters are entitled
to know, he believes, what the republicans
would do at present in Mexico.
what attitude they would take
about belligerent nations in Europe,
whether they would repeal the federal
reserve act, the tariff law, the rural
credits act, the tariff commission bill,
the eight-hour law for railroad employes,
the child labor law and other
legislative acts of the democrats.
Will Not l>well on Adamson Law.
Although several days ago officials
. U . 1
nere saia iuc ricomcut ??vuiu ianc wcasion
to refer frequently to the settlement
of the recently threatened railroad
strike, it became known today
that he has since decided not to dwell
on this question as much as on other
issues. The President believes that
satisfactory settlements of pending international
questions can only be embarrassed
by partisan discussions of
them.
For this reason he is not expected to
reply directly to the challenge issued
by Mr. Hughes that he deny or confirm
the charge that John Lind went to
Mexico with orders to oust Gen. Huerta.
On this subject Mr. Wilson takes
th** position that Huerta was ousted,
that the democratic administration opposed
him consistently and that, therefore.
no reply is necessary.
Expresses Indignation.
President Wilson made it plain last
night that he wants no "disloyal"
American to vote for him. He expressed
indignation over a telegram
from Jeremiah A. CLeary of New
York, president of the American Truth
Society, accusing him of being proBritish
and saying he had failed to obtain
compliance with American rlghta
The President sent Mr. O'Leary a
short telegram which, officials indicated.
Mr. Wilson had desired to put in
stronger language. His message follows:
"Your telegram received. I would
feel deeply mortified to have you or
anybody like you vote for me. Since
you have access to many disloyal
Americans and I have not. I will ask
jod 10 wDTey tmi mcBsagc 10 them."
Mr. O'Lsary's Telegram.
Mr. OTLeary*s telegram, given out by
the President, folio we:

Will Speak as Progressive.
NEW ORLEANS, September 30.?John
M. Parker, progressive vice presidential
nominee, denied over the telephone
from his summers-home at Pass Christian,
Miss., late yesterday a report from
Long Branch, N. J., that he had offered
to speak in support of President Wilson.
"I have not written to President Wilson
or to any of his campaign managers
offering to speak directly in his
behalf," said Mr. Parker. "I did write
recently to Bain bridge uoi Dy, a
York progressive leader, stating that I
was willing to be used In whatever
way appeared best, and that when I
went to New York I would speak
against Mr. Hughes' candidacy. Of
course, that would be in favor of Mr.
Wilson, but I will speak as a progressive
and not as an affirmative supporter
of the democratic nominee."
Mr. Parker reiterated that he preferred
Mr. Wilson over Mr. Hughes, but
he said he did not expect to speak under
the auspices of the democratic campaign
committee.

to Buffalo.
ROUNDS OUT A PROGRAM
COVERING 20,000 MILES
His Addresses Emphasize Views of
Adamson Law and Tariff?Will
Best a Week.
HORNELL, N. Y., September 30.?
Charles E. Hughes today completed his
20,000th mile of campaigning within
eight weeks. He also ended the second
trip of his presidential campaign.
Mr. Hughes left here at 8 a.m. for
Buffalo, with eleven stops between. He
rounded out the 6,500th mile of his trip
on the way. His first trip by rail and
motor was 14,600 miles long.
The day's program provided for stops
at Andover, Wellsvllle, Friendship,
Cuba, Olean, Salamanca, Randolph,
Jamestown, Westfleld, Dunkirk, Silver
Creek and Buffalo. Thirty-minute
stops were scheduled at Wellsvllle,
Olean and Dunkirk, and a forty-minute
stop at Jamestown. At the other cities
and towns ten or fifteen minute stops
were provided for.
Mr. Hughes will return to New York
city at 9:80 a.m. tomorrow, to obtain
as much rest as a week can give him
before beginning his third western
tour on Monday, October 9.
Mr. Hughes went through the southern
tier of counties in New York state
yesterday over his political battleground
of ten years ago. He spoke in
four cities and greeted with handshakes
or a few words ten other audiences
in smaller towns. He left Saratoga
early yesterday morning.
Repeats His Views.
Mr. Hughes repeated his views on the
protective tariff, the Adamson law, the
maintenance of American rights and
other Issues of the campaign. He again
assailed the administration for "surrender
to force," for "broken pledges"
and for "extravagant claims." He reiterated
his declaration that he voted
for protection in its broadest sense
covering American industry, peace and
honor.
In his speech at Blnghamton and
aealn at Elmira and Corning the
nominee went further than he had gone
before in making known his views on
the eight-hour day.
"I am not opposed to the principle
of the eight-hour day," Mr. Hughes
said. "I favor the general principle of
the eight-hour day. I should like to
see an eight-hour work day."
The nominee was accompanied on his
trip by William M. Calder and Robert
Bacon, successful and defeated candidates.
respectively, for the republican
senatorial nomination.
Suffers From Fatigue.
Mr. Hughes was fatigued by the trip.
He reached Hornell so tired of body
and voice that he had a local speaker
address the audience in the opera
house here in his place. The nominee
spoke a few words only after his substitute
had closed. He said:
"Continuously during my terms of
executive responsibility in this state I
sought to promote the Just Interests
of labor, and recommended every practicable
measure to that end. It is true
I did not always agree with the measures
that were proposed. I will admit
that cheerfully, and I may state further
that what I did in connection
with my duty as governor involved a
principle which I should continue to
apply if I again were Invested with
executive responsibility. As governor
I examined the proposals that were
made as clearly as I knew how, and
what I thought was right I favored,
and when I believed a measure waa
I not flttomnt tn train vnt.c
by indorsing it."
Speaks for State Ticket.
Mr. Hughes apparently had finished
speaking and the audience had begun
to file out, when he stepped forward
again and said:
"I want to say this before I closejust
a moment, please?in my desire tc
complete my remarks along the line 3
had gone, I had omitted to say this: ]
desire to see a republican Congress t<
, carry out the policies of a republlcar

STATES ARGUMENT
FOR ARMOR PLANT
Brief Showing Why Factory
Should Be Located Here
(Being Prepared.
SUGGESTIONS ON SUBJECT
DESIRED FROM CITIZENS
Document to Be Laid Before Officials
of Navy Department?Experimental
Station Wanted.
All citizens are urged by the
armor plant committee of the
Chamber of Commerce to co-operate
with that organisation In
Its efforts to have the government
armor plate plant and the naval
laboratory experiment station
located In the District of Colombia.
Any one who can offer suggestions
or arguments as to how
to get the plants here Is requested
to write them out and send to
Secretary Tom Grant, Chamber
of Commerce.
Actual work on the brief to be presented
to officials of the Navy Department,
in an effort to have the government
armor plant established in the
District of Columbia, was begun today
by Tom Grant, secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce. The armor plant
committee of the Chamber of Commerce,
which is headed by President
i P. T. Moran, yesterday authorised Secretary
Grant to do this.
This brief is to be presented in support
of the request which has already
been made by the Chamber of Commerce,
that the plant should be established
in the District of Columbia. It
will embody all arguments which appear
to favor Washington which can
be gathered from persons interested in
the project of having the plant established
here.
Ideas of Citizens Desired.
Suggestions made at the meeting
yesterday by D. J. Kaufman, Joseph
Berberich, John G. Capers, Mr. Moran
and others are to be written out by
those making the suggestions and given
to Secretary Grant for incorporation In
the brief. Also, many suggestions
which have been received from individuals
will be incorporated. All citizens
who have any ideas which they
think might be of use in the campaign
to bring the plant here aire urged to
write them out and send them to Mr.
Grant. Several which have been received
from individuals so far have
proved most valuable, it is explained.
The brief, as drawn up along tentative
lines, will be presented at the next
meetinsr of the committee, if nossihlA.
This meeting probably will be held next
week, although the date for it has not
been set.
Help of Associations Wanted.
Citizens' associations, which have already
placed themselves on record as
favoring the establishment of the
plant here, or which do so in the future,
are going to be asked to give
their assistance to the Chamber of
Commerce, whenever their active services
may be needed. At the same time,
it is pointed out, the moral support
which has so far been given by many
of the organizations is of great help
in the fight.
In addition to the brief presenting
Washington's arguments in behalf of
the plant, a second brief is to be
drawn up urging the establishment
within the National Capital of the
naval laboratory experimental station.
Many of the arguments which have
been presented for the one or other
of these plants, may be applied equally
well to either or both of them.

From 20 to 40 Per Cent.

price for that commodity soar higher
than it is at present, and efforts to secure
government intervention declari
ing an embargo on the exportation of;
wheat as a measure of protection to I
the consumers in the United States are1
being exerted by the largest business
influences. '
Meanwhile practically all other food
supplies continue to advance in price,!
and are now 20 to 40 per cent higher]
than normal. One of the very few ar- 1
' tides that has not advanced is rice, and j
food authorities are recommending that I
this be used extensively by the Ameri- j
can people. Notice that baking powder]
is to be increased about 40 per cent has '
been served on dealers. This increase ]
is due principally to the fact that the j
best brands of baking powder are made j
from cream of tartar which comes from I
France, and the supply has to a great
extent been cut ofT.
Lard is at higher price than retailers
in Washington have ever known. The
normal price is about 12 to 14 cents,
and recently it has been selling as high
as 16 cents. During the week it jumped
to 20 cents.
The prices for potatoes are also the
highest they have been within the recollection
of local dealers. The best potatoes
are now selling for 45 cents a
peck.
Advance in Cereals.
i All cereals have advanced from 1 to 4
cents per package. Especially is the raise
noticeable on the wheat products. The
high cost of paper used for the containers
is responsible for some of this increase.
Beans are now double their normal
price. Dealers who are getting $6.50 a
bushel for them were accused of being extortionate
a couple of years ago when
they asked $4.
Foreign dates, which are Just coming
into the market, are several cents per
pound higher than usual. All nuts also
will be a couple of cents higher.
Where it is possible to get foreign
cheeses they are way up in price. An
Italian cheese that last year sold for 45
cents has Jumped to 75; Edam cheese,
that sold for $1, is now $1.75 and hard to
get; the French cheese also has jumped
from 45 to 75 cents.
The average price for flour in Washington
today is $9.7i> and $10, where
$7.50 and $8 for fancy brands is usually
considered a pood price, me cuviccoi i
- brand of flour in Washington is today J
r being sold at $11.60. One of the best i
1 known and most popular brands, which j
ft in July sold to the dealers for $6, is j

BOARD TO CONSIDER
NEW MACHINE GUNS
Will Meet Monday to Decide on
Character and Quantity for
Military Service.
War Department orders today announce
the appointment of a special board to
meet in this city Monday for the purpose
of considering "the subject of the character
and quantity of machine rifles to
be supplied for the military service."
The board is composed of military and
civilian experts in ordnance as follows:
Col. Francis H. French, general staff;
Col. Joseph T. Dickman, 2d Cavalry; Col.
Tracy C. Dickson, U. S. A., retired;
Lieut. Col. Henry D. Todd, jr.. Coast
Artillery Corps; Capt. Robert H. Willis,
jr., Signal Corps; Bascom Little, Citizens'
building, Cleveland, Ohio, and B. M. W.
Hanson, Hartford, Conn. Capt. Willis is
designated as recorder of the board.
Although not specifically named in the
instructions, the board will consider in
addition to other types, the Lewis machine
gun, once rejected by the United
States ordnance department, and now
said to be in successful use by the British
forces in Europe.
Duties of the Board.
By direction of the Secretary of War,
the board will consider and make recommendations
as to whether a single
type or more than one type of machine
rifle, using small-arms ammunition, is
needed for the service, and the type
or types which should be procured; and
if more than one type, the proportion
of the different types.
"In making its recommendations."
says the Secretary of War, "the board
will take Into consideration the present
supply of machine rifles of the various
types; all reports of tests of machine
rifles which may be believed to
be serviceable in reaching a conclusion;
the amount of funds now available
for the procurement of machine
rifles; the appropriations necessary to
be made in order to complete the supply
at an appropriate rate, and any records
of the War Department, or of any
branch of it, which it may desire to
consult. If the board shall find that
tests previously made are insufficient
to enable it to reach a conclusion it
ther tests which ought to be made,
their character, time and place.
"The board will recommend the type
of gun which should be procured in
case of an emergency requiring an earlier
supply, in possibly limited quantity,
than can be had of the gun which it
may consider as eventually the most
suitable, if there be any of which earlier
delivery may be possible, and
whether contract should be entered into
for a considerable supply of a gun of
known type in advance of any test
which it may conclude to be called for,
and, if so, to what extent. The board
will submit its report to the adjutant
generhl of the army."

Cusihuiriachic between the Carranza
forces under Gen. Matias Ramos and
Villa bandits have been received here
from Gen. Ramos in the form of an official
report of the fight.
The battle was in reality two engagements,
one taking place on the
outskirts of Cusihuiriachic and the other
at a mountain settlement known as
La Bufa. After fighting for five hours
on the outskirts of Cusihuiriachic,

gun fire, the bandits retreated to
La Bufa, where, at dusk, they made a
desperate stand against the de facto
forces, according to the feport of Gen.

Heavy Losses Suffered l>y Gen. Haig
During: Past Month?French
Troops Progress.
LONDON, September 30.?Desperate
fighting has been In progress along the
northern end of the Somme front,
where the British recently have made
important inroads upon German positions
south of the Ancre.
Heavy counter attacks by the Germans
near the Stuff redoubt and the
Hessian trench have been checked. A
division of the new British army acquitted
itself most creditably.
East of Lesboeufs on the Somme
front British troops have occupied 500
yards of German trenches. There haa
been heavy fighting near Thiepval.
The British were forced from a section
of the "Hessian trench," but regained
it later. An official statement
adds that more than 500 prisoners
were taken in this fighting.
Aeros Attack Reinforcements.
"In spite of the weather, British
aeroplanes have done useful work attacking
German reinforcements on the
move. One German machine was destroyed.
One British machine has not
returned."
The British lost heavily in the fighting
on the Somme front during September.
This is indicated by the casualty
lists, which show the casualties
on all fronts during the month to have
been nearly 120,000 officers and men,
or at the rate of more than 3,800 a
day.
British Official Report.
The latest British official account of
yesterday's operations follows:
"During the night the enemy shelled
heavily our battle front south of the
Ancre. We consolidated the ground
won yesterday morning at Destremont
farm, northwest of Le Sars, and improved
our position in the Thiepval
area.
"Enemy counter attacks were beaten
off in the neighborhood of Stuff redoubt
and Hessian trench. The fighting in
this section yesterday was very severe
and our troops engaged?a division of
the new army?showed great endurance
and resolution.
"A successful raid was made by a
London territorial battalion south of
Neuville St. Vaast, where the enemy's
trenches were entered and prisoners
were taken."
French Push Wedge Farther.
Farther down the line toward the
Somme the French have resumed their
attacks, pushing farther the wedge
into the German lines in the region of
Rancourt. The new French advance,
according to Paris, was scored by
means of hand grenade operations
north of Rancourt.
Germans Still Confident.
BERLIN. September 30.?The fighting
on the Somme evidently has not
shaken the confidence of the German
military leaders in their ability to
prevent a breach in their lines. The
Berliner Tageblatt's special war correspondent
interviewed Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria, commander of
the German forces on the Somme,
Tuesday, and the crown prince's utterances
expressed complete confidence in
the situation for the present and the
future.
The crown prince is quoted as'having
said that since the offensive began
the entente allies had gained
some ground, but there could be no
thought of this decisively changing
the situation.
"It is impossible to predict how
things will go hereafter," said Prince
Rupprecht, "but one thing is certain?
namely, that we have everything so
thoroughly prepared that we are able
to contemplate the situation with
equanimity, whatever comes. The
offensive will certainly not reach an
early end.
Have Taken Precautions.
"We can reckon upon an offensive of
great persistence and with heavy attacks,
accompanied by an enormous
expenditure of ammunition. But we
have taken precautions. Our artillery
has been reinforced, and likewise our
Aeroplane Corps, and our fliers have
had fine successes in the last few days,
although they have had hard fighting
against increased numbers. Our artillery
derives advantages from the successful
work of the aeroplanes after
having formerly been much exposed
to observation by hostile aviators.
"Our troops have been striking with
the utmost strength, and the enemy
has found the nut too hard to crack.
It is my distinct opinion that the
enemy is trying to force a decision at
this spot and during this year, and
he has not yet succeeded. He will have
to put up with a winter campaign and
continue his fighting next year."

SECRETLY DISCUSS
GERMAN SITUATION.
Von Bethmann-Hollweg Meets
With Reichstag Ways and
Means Committee.
POLITICAL PARTIES
DISCUSSING TACTICS
? .
Alignment About the Same as During
Test Between Chancellor and
von Tirpitz Group.
BERLIN, September 80.?Discussion
of the general situation and Chancellor
Von Bethmann-Hollweg's speech In the
relchstag has begun in the ways and
means committee of the relchstag. Dr.
Von Bethman-Hollweg and Foreign
Minister Von Jagow both attended the
J meeting to give the necessary explanations
and also information regarding
the situation, while other members
of the cabinet and a staff of the imperial
chancellor's aids were present
to support their chief.
The discussion is being conducted behind
closed doors and under special instructions
to the participants in it to
rerard the Droce-edlngs as confidential.
Tactics Discussed.
The various political parites have
spent most of the time since the adjournment
of the reichstag in party
caucuses, discussing the tactics.
As far as is known there have been
no Important departures from the
alignment in the preceding clash between
the followers of Dr. von BethmannHollweg
and Admiral von Tirpitz. when
the chancellor was in full control of
the situation, except that resulting
from the split in the south German
centrist ranks. The defection here has
affected the reichstag representation
only secondarily, most of the chancellor's
critics being members of diets or
the holders of no official positions.
The Catholic organ, Germania, discussing
the chancellor's speech, demands
emphatically full confidence in
the chancellor. It declares that the
chancellor's words against England
should "sweep away the noxious atmosphere."
Expressions Softened.
Commenting on the speech of Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg in the
German reichstag, the Berliner Tageblatt
says:
"An almost academic reserve was at
times to be observed. The speaker
took great pains to soften down his
expressions and observe moderation,
and allow more to be guessed at between
the lines than he expressed
specifically. We must assume that this
restraint was not unintentional. The
chancellor himself pointed out that
foreign countries were watching every
CApi CE?IUU.
The Berlin Lokal Anzeiger says:
"The chancellor showed clearly the
fundamental distinction between the
motives under which we and the
enemy are waging war. Whoever
grasps the difference between these
motives can have no doubt as to who
bears the responsibility for prolonging
this war."
Change in the Tone
of German Chancellor
Is Noted in England
LONDON, September 30.?The address
of the German imperial chancellor. Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg, in the refchstag
is more remarkable for what it
omitted than for what it said, according
to Lord Robert Cecil, minister of
war trade, who, in discussing the
speech with the Associated Press, declared
the most significant fact in connection
with the chancellor's utterance
was his failure to mention Belgium.
Lord Robert said:
"There is a very definite change in
the tone of. the speech over the previous
efforts of the chancellor. The talk
of <a complete German victory is entirely
absent. Another remarkable
thing was that there was not a word
about Belgium. The significance of
this is probably that he was unable
to say anything about Belgium as his
listeners can be assumed to be the
Whole world and he was bound to
offend a section of it if Belgium was
mentioned. If he attempted to Justify
German occupation he would offend the
best of all neutral opinion, and equally
offend his own people if he expressed
an option to give up that country.
Trick Seen in Charges.
"Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg's denunciation
of England, while violent,
contained nothing really new. It was
merely the old trick of attempting to
convince our allies that we are trading
on their efforts and bleeding them to
death in the process; but recent events
on the Somme ought to convince him
of his error. The idea that we want
world supremacy is fantastic."
Lord Robert stated that he believed
the German imperial chancellor was
sincere in his declaration that Germany
was waging war with every possible
instrument. Continuing, he said:
"The lull in submarine warfare is
due to a shortage in submarines, and
it is always increased when instruments
are at hand. The only change I
note is that no British passenger liner
has been sunk since the Sussex. The
number of submarine victims has been
' increasing steadily in the last three
I months, and our allies and neutrals
I hnv?. suffered virtually as much as We
have."
Opinions of the Press.
All the morning newspapers devote a
major part of their editorial space to a
discussion of the speech of Imperial
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
contrasting its mild tone with former
utterances. The editorials all assert
that, aside from the attacks on England.
the chancellor said little that
was new and perhaps disappointed
[ those who expected him to make more
I extended peace overtures.
The Times draws attention to what It
calls the unmistakable contrast in
which the chancellor's speech stands to
his earlier addresses, and $dds:
"The^hief interest to the outside
world is in its revelation of Germany's
I growing consciousness that her plight
! is already serious and is destined to
become graver. The speech in the
main is an appeal to the f hesitating
public to subscribe to tbA new war
loan." 1
