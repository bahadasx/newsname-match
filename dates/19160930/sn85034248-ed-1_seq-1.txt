"The Bugle Call" at the Gem Today.
Willie Collier, Jr., son of the fa
Imous Broadway funmaker, is but
"fourteen years old, and yet he has ai
,ready become a star on his own ac
count. His first v icle is "The Bu
gle Call," a Tria ce drama of
rntier life, in e will appear
st the Gem to.
The boy actor has the part of Little
Billy, ten-year-old son of Captain
William Andrews, commandant at the
m.ilitary frontier post of Fort McPher
son, and is dearly beloved by every
one in the place. He has one ambition
in life, which he has confided to his
very good friend, Sergeant Hogan,
Aind that is to become a good soldier.
-cHe already has taken one step in that
direction by learning to play the army

She one night rouses the garrison by
blowing the alarm.
4 It is only because he is a good sol
lier that he can receive with equani
sity the news that his father is going
to marry again, for he cannot bear
the idea of any one taking his dead
)iother's place. But when the wed
jling takes place he hides away in the b
stable with his pony and his dog and
weeps bitterly until Hogan tells him

,"Mr. Goode, the Samaritan."
DeWolf Hopper and Fay Tinchet
are starred in the Triangle comedy
drama, "Mr. Goode, the Samaritan,'
which will be shown at the Gem Sun
day.
Mr. Goode, a wealthy old gentle
ma, .takes his wife and daughter,
vevina, out for a spin in their auto
.mobile, but, throwing in the wrong
lever, the machine backs into the side
of the road and burns up. They con
tinue their journey on foot.
Meanwhile, Foxy Monte, a polished
crook, has stolen a beautiful car that
:has been left standing at the curb in
'a nearby town, and as he whizzes by
he sees the Goode family. He stops
and offers them a lift. Of course,
they gladly accept. And while the
ride is continued he persuades Mr.
Goode to buy the roadster. Mr.
Goode i4 so easy, in fact, that Monte
determii.s to impose on him again.
WhennGoode is called out of own
on busin~ess he makes the " his
new machine. As an alar een

owner of the car m mediate
ly apprehended and into jail.
His family, believing as been de
tainel on business, make no inquiry
about him, but go on entertaining
Foxy Monte, who has come into their
circle disguised by a full beard and
another alias.
Ever making the best of his condi
tion, Goode has the jail refurnished
and otherwise contributes to the com
fort of the inmates. Upon leaving at
the expiration of his sentence, he in
'vites the jailbirds to come and visit
him at the first opportunity.
Shifty Ed and his eest girl, Shorty
sal, come to the Goode home to pay
that visit just as Mrs. GO e is enter
taining a very fashionable house
party, Monte in the number. Sal
recognizes Monte, and he, realizing
he is in danger, informs the hostess
that Ed and Sal are notorious crooks.
Then he persuades Evelina, whose
hand has been refused him by Mr.
Goode, to elope with him. It is at
this point that Ed and Sal make a big
'return for the kindness of Mr. Goomc,
-and there is a thrilling finish.
"A Woman's Way."
Ethel Clayton and Carlyle Black
Well will again be seen together in a
seCiety drama, this time "A Woman's

. different from anything she has here- I
tofore essayed, when she is presented
on the Triangle program in an ab
y sorbing drama of blind devotion, en
titled "The Sorrows of Love." Miss
' Barriscale is supported by William c
Desmond, who will be best remem
bered, perhaps, for his excellent work t
with Billie Burke in "Peggy," and i
with Bessie Barriscale in "Bullets and
r Brown Eyes."
Beatrice is a nun, known to the
rest of her sisterhood as the "Lily"
because of her great goodness and
purity. Prince Candoni brings his o

The Grand's Program for the Coming
Week.
Sunday-Marie Walcamp in "The
I Flirt."
t Monday-Marie Doro in "The
1 Heart of Nora Flynn."
Tuesday-Theda Bara in "East
Lynne."
Wednesday-Pauline Frederick in
"The Moment Before."
Thursday-Tyrone Power in "John
Needham's Double."
Friday-Anita Stewart in "The
Daring of Diana."
Saturday-Fourth episode of "Peg
o' the Ring," comedy and cartoons.
"The Flirt."
She was a lartle4 flirt; a beauti
I ful girl who toyed with men's hearts
and then cast them ruthlessly aside.
Self-willed and egotistical, able by
her charm of manner to attract men
with the same ease in which she
brushed them from her path when she
had conquered them, her willful ca
price was given full sway until there
came a time when one man gave her
a "dose of her own medicine." Then
humbled, crestfallen and made ridic
ulous in the eyes of her victims, she
was given just punishment for heil
previous heartlessness.
This is just an idea of Booth Tark
ington's great story, which, as con
verted into a Bluebird photoplay, will
be shown Sunday at the Grand The
atre. Marie Walcamp, beautiful and
talented, plays the title role in "The
Flirt," and is ably supported by Mas
ter Antrim Short.
"The Heart of Nora Flynn."
This feature, in which Marie Doro
will be seen at the Grand Monday,
!eaches the best Lasky standard. In
the first place a real human interest
story is there. It is entirely original.
it illustrates one of the most admira
ble traits in the Irish character. A
man or a woman with a real Irish
heart cannot betray a confidence.
Nothing is more repellant to the Irish
character than to be an "informer."
Nora Flynn is only a poor, simple
little servant, but she has this admira
ble trait of her race to a marked de
gree. Driven to bay, disheartened
with desertion by the man she loves,
her reputation as a good woman
trembling in the balance, Nora re
fuses to betray her mistress. True,
her mistress has done nothing for her,
even plots against her, but she is
staunch in her human loyalty, and
out of her sacrifice and suffering is
born happiness to others. Surely
there never was a finer theme for a
strong, clean film play.
Marie Doro has excellent support.
Of the splendid lighting effects, of
the superb settings and the realistic
aw-atmosphere it is not necessary to say
much when commenting on a Lasky
es 1 production. .A wave of pleasure and
e satisfaction will sweep over every au
ad dience at the end of this play, which
ig, here and there forces a little moisture
re I to the eye.
P
:i- "East Lynne."
is Theda Bara, in a moving picture
3- revival of the famous stage favorite,
o East Lynne," will be the Tuesday at
1- traction at the Grand. This remark
le able William Fox photoplay excels
h even that noted producer's previous
y tliumphs in master picture making.
n The old drama of English country life
't is enacted in all trueness to its power
a ful form by an all-star cast in support
1- of Miss Bara, including Claire Whit
ney, Stanhope Wheatcroft, W. IH.
)- Tooker, Stuart Holmes, and other
g actors ar actresses of sound reputa
1, lion e and screen.
r Th o retains all the dramat
d ic and lite' force of the play and
d novel, but increases the scope of the
story along lines only possible in mov
0 ing pictures. Bertram Bracken, who
directs the pictures starring Miss Ba
ra, selected scenery true to type in
old-fashioned spots in the east, where
e the buildings and gardens appear
y quite like those of rural England, and
the interior scenes, taken in the Fox
I studios in New Jersey, show genuine
- old English antique furnishings,
- which lend a color unusually correct,
s even considering the usual accuracy
I of high-class picture productions.
Miss Bara, whose parts as beau
tiful villainess are well known to mov
I ing picture audiences, in this film
1 reaches the height of her emotional
powers.
"The Moment Before."
It is in the widely contrasting roles
of a duchess and a gypsy that Pauline
Frederick is seen in "The Moment Be
fore," which the Grand announces as
its Wednesday offering. The picture
is an adaptation of Israel Zangwill's
drama. The exteriors were photo
graphed in Florida, and these are no
table in their pictorial effect.
The story is shown in inverted
form. The first reel and a half is of
the duchess who gives freely of her
time and money to charity. As her
life draws suddenly to a close follow
ing the accidental death of the duke
the scene fades into a gypsy camp,
with the gray-haired duchess as a
cl sa fierce fight of two rivals
for her hand. The subject contains
an abundance of action.
In the role of Madge Miss Fred
erick makes a striking gypsy. She
becomes the bride of John the Gypsy
through force, not through consent.
It is primitive lovemaking on the part
of the man. The real affection of the
gypsy woman comes to the surface
when she meets Harold, the younger
son of the Duke of Maldon. It is
through the intervention of two .trag
edies, the death of the older brother.
at the hand of John and the shooting
of John by Madge to prevent him kill
ing Harold, that the way is cleared
for thegypsy to become the duchess.

"John Needham's Double."
At the Grand next Thursday, in
"John Needham's Double," Tyrone
Power, impersonating both the char
acter of John Needham and Joseph
Norbury, will, aided by the magic of
the motion picture camera, be shown
in the act of conversing with himself
-chatting in friendly manner with
himself during short walks, moving
tbout in the same room in animated
scenes, smoking, drinking and pleas
antly entertaining himself; finally
pouring out the poison which he
drinks himself, and in the end ex
changing clothes with himself and
walking out of the room, leaving his
own body lying dead upon the floor.
John Needham has been made the
guardian of a bo who would become
a millionaire reaching his ma
jority. Needl n packed the boy off
to boarding hool. The boy's sur
roundings were distasteful; he fled
and was heard of no more.
The profligate Needham spent all
the boy's fortune, and when time
came to settle he faced disgrace and
imprisonment. Needham's cousin,
Joseph Norbury, looked as much like
Needham as the second pea in a pod.
Their friends saluted them with the
names of each other; strange things
happened to them because of their
Striking resemblance. This resem
blance led to the crime committed by
John Needham.
"The aring of Diana."
The story of how Strange, the Paris
agent of a New York newspaper, at
tempts to impersonate the owner of
the paper, and of the manner in
which circumstances and a quick wit
place within the power of Diana Pear
son, a reporter on this particular
newspaper, the means of turning the
situation against the villain and win
ning for herself love and position, is
,'iven a thrilling recital in "The Dar
ing of Diana," which comes to the
Grand Friday.
Anita Stewart as Diana Pearson
has invested the role with all that
belongs by right of profession to
the character of the alert newspaper
woman, plus her own personal charm.
[he supporting cast is a fine one, in
cluding Anders Randolph in the role
of Strange, and Julia Swayne Gordon
as his castaway mistress, who for the
sake of her child follows him to
America, and, goaded to pera
tion through his abuse, lays e the
plan by which he has schem gain

BED-T STORIES
(Exactly as ri.tten)
The Gentle Boy,
Out in the country, in a little log
cabin, there lived a fussy old lads
who had many children. And sh(
fussed with them from morning til:
night. Soon they began to fuss aw
she did. If one of them made a pea
shooter, the others would fight for it.
They pulled it out of one another's
hands and jerked it away from one
another until it was almost out of
shape.
"Stop yer fussin'," she would say.
"Get to work, yer little hoodlums.
Mary Ellen, I tol' yer to darn them
stockin's 'fo it gets too late, an'
Johny, yer bring in dat bucket o'
water."
They would mumble to themselves
as they worked.
One bright morning as the sun was
just beginning to rise, another child
was born. It was a boy,
"My lan's!" exclaimed the fussy
old lady, "ain't ah got enough chillins
without gittin' another un?"
The boy grew up to be kind and
good. All the people that lived
around loved him. He was not like
his brothers and sisters at all. He
would go to the woods nearby and
make the wild animals his pets. He
had so many pets that at last he had
to build a house for them because his
mean mother would not let him bring
them home. He would save some of
his food for them.
His brothers. and sisters would not
go with him to the woods to see the
animals because they were too mean
and hateful to do anything except to
fuss and fight.
The boy would stay in the woods
from sunrise to sunset playing with
his pets. Soon they became so attach
ed to him that he had a hard time
keeping them from following him
home.
The boy was so gentle that soon
his mother became loving and kind
hearted too. She did not fuss any
longer. Then the children began to
get good and didn't fight for the toys.
The pets came to live with them.
They were good watchmen and would
not let anyone go near the cabin ex
cept the old lady and her children.
The home was now a happy irvs
and the boy had done it all.
The days went by and there was
no fussing or fighting In the little
cabin. And soon it seemed tc the
old lady that she was the happiest
woman in the land, just because she
lidn't fuss. And she realy was.
Kindness is happiness.
Are You Looking Old?
Old age comes quick enough with
out inviting it. Some look old at
forty. That is because they neglect
the liver and bowels. Keep your
bowels regular and your liver healthy
and you will not only feel younger
but look younger. When troubled
with constipation or biliousness take
Chamberlain's Tablets. They are in

SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNIC.
Boys and Girls of Fourth Division En,
joy Outing at Galvez.
girls of the fourth division, First Dis
trict Interdenominational Sunday
School Association, was held al
Galvez, in the beautiful woods, Sat
urday, Sept. 9.
Miss Verna Singletary, in charge of
the social hour, directed several good
games, after which was spread the
surxlptuous lunch provided by the girl,
and boys. After lunch we proceeded
with our program, but a heavy rain
fall caused us to retreat to the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Dugas, who kindly
let us use their spacious gallery for
our service. Miss Singletary led the
dev'otional service, taking as her Bible
lesson the story of Ruth, stressing
Ruth's loyalty.
The following subjects were pre
sented: Wesley Sibley gave a splen
did paper on "A Boy's Responsibility
to His School,"
Carl Muller presented a paper on
"A Boy's Responsibility to His God."
His principal thought was, a boy is
responsible to God for the way he
treats his body, and the way he im
proves himself. Miss Rowan talked
on "The Four-Fold Life."
"How I May Help to Make My Sun
day School a Better Sunday School"
was discussed by May Causey and,
Marshall Henry. They stressed reg
ular attendance, prepared lessons,
organized classes and working ,the
plan, urging the superintendent to
plan a helpful program every Sun
day; and by getti other boys and
girls to attend Su School.
Lena Kelley's papeli "What Shall
i See in Nature" help to bring us
nearer to God. She said: "God has
given all nature to us for our happi
ness and comfort, that through it we
might see Him and hear Him speak
to us."
Miss Singletary discussed "Organ
izing Our Class," giving reasons why
and methods how to organize the
class.
The following songs were render
ed: "The Sunday School Brigade,"'
by boys and girls of Mt. Zion school;
"Almost Persuaded," by boys and
girls of Faithful school. "Loyalty to
Christ," chosen as the *ng for the
mass meeting, was sun y all, only
as boys and girls can sing it. The
state association rally song, which is
so familiar to our boys and girls, was
thoroughly enjoyed.
After the benediction cake was
provided by the girls and lemonade
by the president of the division, G. C.
Williams.
There were nine boys and sixteen
irls registered. Five schools were
represented, viz: Broussard Grove,
Meadows, Chapel, Mt. Zion, Faithful
and Carpenter's Chapel. The boys
and girls went home eager for an
other meet.

D. S. LeBlane, justice of the peace,
Belle Rose, La., says: "I was in a
pretty bad way with kidney trouble.
Sometimes the kidney secretions were
unnatural and irregular in passage.
My back was stiff and painful. I had
dizzy spells also. Uric acid filled my
system and my left arm became so
stiff i couldn't move it. I used many
different medicines, but without
avail. Doan's Kidney Pills, however,
helped me from the first. They
strengthened my kidneys and the
rheumatic pains in my arms and
shoulder gradually left me. I have
been well now for a long time, al
though I occasionally take a box of

Woman a Tick Expert.
Every one knows how materially
the cattle tick affects the finances of
the southern agricultural district.
Thousands of dollars are lost annual
ly by the ravages of the tick pest.
Mrs. G. H Mather of Gadsden, Ala

inaugurated a campaign in her dis
trict to educate the farmers and erad
icate the ticks. She told them of
the commercial necessity for well-fed,
tick-free cattle. The quarantine laws
are very strict. Every carload of
southern cattle that is not from tick
free territory must be marked "Dis
eased Southern Cattle." These sick
cattle bring little prices and their
hides, being full of tick holes, have
small value. From a steer weighing

of the income of the State Teachers'
Association, which is controlled by
the men; also, they contribute the
greater part of the income of the
teachers' retirement fund, and every
time a male teacher is retired he gets
the maximum annuity, while the wo
man teacher may not get half as
much. The Trenton Times makes the
following comment on this condition:
"The woman teachers in the pubgic
schools have organized for their pro
tection. It is doubtful, howeir,
whether the wothen will be able to
get their rights through organization.
What they really need is the ballot,
which' influences legislators and the
boards of education to listen to the de
mands made by the men, who do ex
actly the same: work as the women
but at salaries that are prat~itally
doulble."

t ',k grand -wor th -vise- president °
of the Fraternal Orider of iagles,
and who was for six years prosecut
ing attorney for the state of Cali
fornia, is an ardent advocate of wo
man suffrage. .He says nearly all of
the women of California vote and
apparently find nothing distasteful in
so doing. Women gather together
and discuss political questions, and
vote, not as their forefathers did,
but as they themselves think. This
is different from the program of most
men, who vote as their "daddies" did
or as their party leaders tell them to.
