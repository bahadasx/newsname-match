inspect new inventions in the way of

WHAT WILL
BE DONE
TO BOYS?
: Ordinance Forbids Boys or Girls Under
Eighteen Years to Drive Motor Cars
Within City Limits
City officials are confronted with a
problem which will require study and
good judgment to solve and will likely
result in tho repeal of the ordinance
which provides that persons under
eighteen years of age shall not drive
automobiles or motor propelled vehi
cles within the limits of tho city of
Chickasha.
The impression has prevailed that
Ibis law affected only those under six
leeu. which age limit , was mentioned
hy Councilman Dul'oso when he inquir
ed of .tho council Thuri-duy night what
course would ba pursued in the matter
of permitting "kids" to run curs with
in the city limits. Children of tender
years are often permitted to handle
the steoria.t wheel, he said, and when
they g.it out on the country roads they
whoop it up. While that was not :i
matter of moment to (lie city council
ho was interested in knowing what
steps would be. taken to execute tno
law in Chickasha.
Mayor Coffman staled at the meet
ing that an ordinance was now in ef
fect limiting tho age at which motor
cars might br driven by persons iu
Chickasha and? that an examining
bourd had already been created by or
dinance but had not been active. A
discussion arose ts to the expediency
of the ordinance, sonio councilnien
stating that boys under sixteen weie
oftentimes more capable drivers than
their elders.
The mayor asked until the next reg
ular session to appoint an active board,
J one competent to pass upon ilie quali
fications of a chauffeur.
Investigation at the city hall this
morning revealed the fact that an age
limit of eighteen is prescribed by the
ordinance instead of sixteen and that
th penalty for its violation is a fine of
not under $fi nor exceeding $25 for
every violation. This matter will not
be pushed by the traffic officer, how
ever, until further and definite steps
are taken'by the council.
This ordinance was passed several
years ago when there were not a doz
en automobiles in the city. By the
tim the number of cars reached ap
preciable proportions the ordinance
was forgotten. At present many boys
and girls under eighteen are driving
cars and many of them are competent.
To eliminate thera as drivers would j
work an inconvenience on many fath-i
ers in Chickasha for whom their chil- j
dren call after business hours and who
drive them down to their offices in tho
j morning, returning the car to the gar
j age where it is placed at tho disposal
j of tho family during tho day. It is
pointed out that a girl ot sixteen or
seventeen is almost of age and thnt ,
many boys under fifteen are good driv
ers, and although not possessed of the
mature judgment of adults make fairly
safe drivers and often sit at the wheel (
i when accompanied by their parents. (
What seems to be the most probable '
course that the council will pursue a -
cording to those who are informed In
the premises, is the confirmation of a
competent examining board to be np
pointed by the mayor and the repeal of
the present ordinance so that only
those who can pass examinations aj
competent drivers may be permitted
to direct motor cars within the city
i limits reasonably irrespective of age. !
In determining upon the qualifies-j
i tions of such drivers the members of i
the board will be "shown" by the ap !
plicants and not vice versa. It will be I
no part of the duties of the board to j
instruct drivers but to judge whether
applicants can handle their cars with-'
out endangering the safety of the ;
era! public. Thereafter no one w ill be
permitted to drive a car without a li-1
cense should such legislation bo en-.
acted. , j
fin other fact which has developed In j
j the discussion f the roatfr is that no
: law at present exists for (he punish-!
jment in the city court of boys under;
sixteen in case of accident

Mayor Coffman Gathers in Shekel to
Amount of $873.50 This Month
and Expenses $G0O
When the police department of the
city the size of Chickasha nets that
city $273 over and above all operating
expenses it shows activity. That was
the showing which has been made by
the Chickasha department in cash re
ceipts taken by Mayor O. Carman, act
ing polico judge.
The mayor, with tho proceeds of ths
4 o'clock session of the police court
still to be heard from, has taken in
$S73..10 in cold cash this month iu
fines. 'The expnses of tha department
being but $G00 a neat profit was realiz
ed. But these receipts cannot be used
for any purpose this year beyond the
$1000 which is provided in tho budget.
All over that amount must bo held in
reserve to be accounted for at the end
of the fiscal year.
Notwithstanding this showing Mayor
Coffman reiterates that the depart
ment is not being run for revenue but
for the protection of the city and that
the surplus is a by-product.

eight weeks for one of these young
Britishers to develop from an unsteady
yellow fuzzy creature into a defiant
