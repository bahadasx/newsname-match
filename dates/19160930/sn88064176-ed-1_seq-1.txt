have prepared their report to the

7To the Honorable President and Mem
bers of the Police Jdry of Grant Par
ish, Louisiana:
Gentlemen--At a meeting of
the citizens of Grant parish held
in the Brinker Hotel at 7:30 p.
m. Sept. 26, pursuant to publish
ed call, the Grant Parish Jeffer
son Highway Association was or
ganized, and the undersigned
committee was appointed by the
association to ascertain the as
sessment value within the pro
posed Jefferson Highway District
No. 8, which you are asked to
create, and to report our findings
to your honorable body at your
meeting on Oct. 2, 1916.
We are able to find the exact
and definite assessed values as to
wards one, six and seven, but
have to estimate as to the ap
proximate value of the fractional
part of ward two asked to be in
cluded in the proposed district.
The total 5-mill special tax on
the whole of ward 2 was $3,534
and we estimate that about two
fifths of this value is included in
the fraction designated. We
therefore think it practically safe
to say that something near one
third of the value of the ward
can be rated, say $1250 for this
fraction. The territory embraced
in the proposed road district, on
a basis of 5 mills, will yield an
nually the following revenue:
W ard 1 ...............................$ 4,003 52
W ard 6 .............................. 2,500 00
Ward 7 ..................... .......... 3,150 00
Ward 2 fraction (estimated). 1,250 00
Total ................................ $10,9(03 52
Thirty times this amount would
be $327,105.60, which we regard
as ample to retire the annual
principal and interest of the
$150,000.00 issue of 30-year bonds
it is proposed to issue. It is pos
sible that the rate of taxation to
be levied can be decreased some
what below the 5-mill rate after
the matter has been looked into
and estimated by the police jury.

lution was adopted:
Whereas the Federal Govern

of National Farm Loan Banks for
the United States, and the loca
tion of those banks is now under I
consideration, and
Whereas the State of Louisiana
is recognized as one of the great
est agricultural States in the
Union, whose resources are un
limited, but needing development
and assistance; therefore, be it
Resolved by the citizens of
Colfax, parish of Grant, That the
Federal Farm Loan Bank system
be heartily endorsed; that its ob
jects, purposes and advantages
be encouraged; that the State of
Louisiana as a field for its useful
ness be called to the attention of
the proper authorities; and that
the City of New Orleans, because
of its position as the metropolis
of the South; because of its pres
tige as the second greatest port
in the United States; because of
its prominence as a cotton, cane,
rice, lumber and banking center
and its agricultural leadership,
and because of its ability to serve
the farmers of the South, be en
dorsed as a location and domicile
of one of the Federal Farm Loan
Banks and the Hon. Martin Behr
man, Mayor of New Orleans, is
respectfully requested to present
these resolutions to the Hon. Wm.

Loan Bank Committee.
