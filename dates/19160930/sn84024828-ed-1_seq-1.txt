NDORSE
PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 29. Un
qualifiedly endorsing President Wil
son, Governor Hunt, the Arizona
delegation in congress and all the
policies of both the national and state
Democratic administrations, the De
mocratic state platform was adopted
this afternoon by the state party
council. The platform is one of the
longest on record.
The platform points in glowing
terms to the administration of Presi
dent Wilson and commends his nat
ional record and the action of the
Democratic congress in passing the
'Adamson bill, the child labor bill, the
farm loan bill, and other popular De
mocratic measures.
Governor Hunf s policies, including
prison reform, the handling of labor
disputes, and what is termed the en
forcing of laws with equal justice to
rich and poor alike are commended.
Prohibition, woman suffrage and
good roads are endorsed, while the
workmen's compensation law, to be
voted on this fall, the "negative con
servation policy of Republicanism"
and legislative redistricting are con
demned. TO HOME IN EAST
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
After spending two weeks inspect
ing the district George J. Reiner left
last evening for his home in New
York. He is well known here, having,
financed the Oatman Southern and
Murdock Mining companies. His visit
here was for the purpose of looking
after the interests of these compan
ies and to inspect other properties
which he contemplates financing.
In an interview before leaving Oat
man last evening Mr. Reiner stated
that there is not another gold mining
section of the entire west which has
such a bright future as Oatman and
the entire San Francisco mining dis
trict, and that the' mineral resources
of the district have only slightly
scratched.
Mr. Reiner went into detail in ex
plaining the East's reluctance in com
ing into this district. This, he stated,
had been caused by the vast profits
which are being made in the so-called
"war babies," or war stocks. Mr.
Reiner is of the opinion that it will
be the individual investor and not
the stock broker of the East who will
bring money here to develop the vast
mineral resources. He is also of the
opinion that a vast amount of capital
will also be brought here from the
Pacific Coast.
"One thing which has done more
to keep capital out of the district
than anything else has been some
so-called expert reports which were
rendered by unscrupulous mining
engineers," said Mr. Reiner. "Every
proven property of the district is con
clusive evidence that the reports are
false: These reports give the dis
trict a 'black-eye' for a time but the
investing public has become educated
to the fact that Oatman is here to
stay and that there are yet undevelop
ed resources awaiting the man who
will develop them."
Mr. Reiner states that at the Mur
dock and Oatman Southern properties
operations will be resumed in a short
time with the object of exploring the
veins to the fullest extent. He is
fully confident that both properties
will be proven to be among the best
in the district. He thinks the Black
Range, Nellie and other properties
of the southern portion of the district
will make good in the very Bear fu
ture. HAULING MILL
The machinery for the Keystone
mill is being hauled from Chloride to
Mineral Park by teams. The rolls
weigh 33,000 pounds each. The work
5s being done by Frank and George
Chappell who recently bought out Tom
Ramsey. The mill will be as large
as that of the United Eastern.
TURNING OUT HIGH
E
From Wednesday"! Dailr Mlnerl
The mill of the Arizona Butte com
pany is turning out the highest grade
concentrates ever produced in Mohave
county. Samples taken from the bins
! show the concentrates to have a value
of 66 per cent lead, $45 gold and 12
ounces silver to the ton.
The null is running smoothly and
another shift was added Tuesday
night. It is the intention of the com
pany to keep the plant in operation

ARIZ. GDPPERFIEL05
TO
TO
William Barret Ridgely of New
York, president of the Arizona Cop-
perfields, Inc., is now in Salt Lake
City, Utah, cooperating with his as
sociates in the consolidation of the
Emma Copper company and the Old
Emma Mines company. These com
panies have contiguous properties in
the camp of Alta in the famous Cot
tonwood district, about 20 miles from
the Utah capital.
Mr. Ridgely is president of the Em
ma Copper company and Mr. C. S.
Herzig is its managing director and
consulting engineer. The latter is also
consulting engineer of the Arizona
Copperfields, Inc., the holdings of
which are located in the Mineral Park
quadrangle in the Cerbat mountains,
about 15 miles north of Kingman. The
successful and famous Utah mining
operator, Jesse Knight, is president
and the controlling stockholder of the
Old Emma Mines company. The Old
Emma occupies a very limited area
and is entirely surrounded by the
more pretentious area of the Emma
Copper company.
In. the late 70's the Old Emma was
a famous bonanza silver-lead producer
for several years. The richest ore
shoot was suddenly cut off by a fault.
Notwithstanding this unfortunate oc
currence, the Old Emma and the prop
erty now held by the Emma Copper
company were worked intermittently
for the succeeding 40 years on lean
ores left standing or adjacent low
grade material. AH those years ex-
poratory work was indefatigably but
unsuccessfully carried on to locate the
continuation of the famous faulted
orebody.
A few months ago President Knight
gave several stockholders of the Em
ma Copper company a long-time lease
on the property of the Old Emma.
For purposes of economical and scien
tific development, the owners of the
lease combined with the Emma Cop-
per company in a comprehensive dia
mond drilling campaign in an effort
to find the lost bonanza orebody., En
gineer Herzig was given a free hand,
in consequence of which two diamond
drill outfits were immediately installed
and work vigorously prosecuted.
While Mr. Ridgely was in Kingman
recently he received a telegram from
Mr. Herzig announcing the glad tid
ings that one drill had penetrated 27
feet of high grade silver-lead ore, as
saying $90 per ton. Another drill sub
sequently pierced 18 feet of practically
the same grade of ore without dis
closing the bottom of the orebody,
which lies in bedded planes of soluble
limestone. Thus after being lost for
more than 40 years, the famous bo
nanza has been recovered and Mr.
Herzig"s reputation as a geologist and
ore finder sustained in no uncertain
measure.
Plans for the consolidation of the
two companies named above have been
practically marked out and Messrs.
Ridgely and Herzig are expected in
Kingman early next month to perfect
plans for the comprehensive explora
tion and development of the property
of the Arizona Copperfields, Inc.
CHLORIDE HIGHWAY IS
NEARING COMPLETION
The new road between Kingman and
Chloride is fast approaching comple
tion. Grading of the section between
McConnico and Union will soon be
under way. All the law places are to
be protected with culverts. When a
good rain falls on it and packs down
the road will be one of the best in the
county and will be as extensively
traveled as any piece of road in the
state.
RETURNS HOME FROM A
VISIT TO CAMP OF JEROME
George Bethune, a well known as-
sayer and mining man of Kingman,
returned yesterday morning from Je
rome, where he was called several
weeks ago to make an examination of
a property. He reports the big cop
per camp enjoying boom times, every
prospect being taken over and oper
ated by recently organized mining
mining companies. The shares of the
important mining companies are being
bid up in the market and many people
in Jerome and Clarkdale have acquired
fortunes from the enhanced values.
J. C. Sievert arrived from the Tung
sten mines yesterday.
KINGMAN
CONTRIBUTIONS TO
DEMOCRATIC F
ARE BEING RECEIVED
NEW YORK, Sept. 29. A fund of
$1,500,000 will be required to conduct
the Democratic national campaign,
according to a statement made here
tonight by Henry Morgenthau, treas
urer of the national campaign com
mittee. He declared New York was
expected to contribute about one
third of this amount, which exceeds by
about $400,000 the sum spent in the
1912 campaign.
As an example of the increased cost
of the present campaign, Mr. Mor
genthau said that the printing bill
alone would be three times as much
as it was in 1912 because of the in
creased price of paper. He announced
that contributions thus far received
exceeded by 65 per cent those which
had been sent in up to the same date!
in 1912. There have been several
contributions of $10,000 each but
only three of more than that amount,
he said.
REPUBLICANS WILL

SECY WILSON SAYS
CHILD LAROR LAW
BE
WASHINGTON, Sept 29. Secre
tary Wilson, a member of the board
of three cabinet members designated
to draft regulations putting the new
child labor law into effect, issued a
statement tonight, replying to asser
tions that the law could be evaded
easily by holding products in storage
for 30 days after their manufacture.
Those who attacked the law, he said,
failed to distinguish between produc
ing plants and warehouses, which
might be located under the same roof
and still be distinct under the mean
ing of the provision barring from in
terstate commerce any product re
moved from a plant in which child
labor had been employed within the
30 days previous.
Secretary Wilson declared that any
removal, therefore, of a commodity
from the plant where it was produced
by child labor, even though it was
stored a foot away for 30 days or any
other period, would make it forever
inacceptable in interstate commerce.
L. R. Hare and family of Oatman
are in town.
ELKS' THEATRE
Tonight at the Elks' theatre, "Hoo
doo Ann," a Triangle picture with Mae
Marsh and Robert Harron m the lead
ing roles, will be presented. The play

which all ends well and "Hoodoo Ann"
becomes happily married and later
known as "Sunshine Ann."
TO PLAY CHLORIDE
"The Old Homestead" company,
which played at the Elks' theatre Wed
nesday night, will go to Chloride Sun
day to give a performance there that
evening. The people of that town
should turn out and see the show, as
it is one of the best given in this sec
tion for some time.
E REPORT ON
E
The Chloride Central Mines com
pany, the property of which is located
in the camp of Chloride near the Ten
nessee mine, has engaged George A.
Bethune of Kingman, formerly mining
expert for the Northern Pacific Rail
road company, to make a thorough
inspection of the report upon its hold
ings.
It is announced that it is the in
tention of the company to erect an oil
'flotation plant of good capacity and
to increase its size as developments
in the mine justify. The company in
tends later on to construct a plant
for the refining of the product of the
mill, using the sulphuric acid process
to extract the gold, silver and zinc,
which method is used by the Anacon
da Copper company at Butte, Mont.

1 LAW
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 29. Sena
tor James Hamilton Lewis of Illionis,
who was elected to congress from this
state 20 years ago, and who left Seat
tle for Chicago 15 years ago, received
an ovation when he was introduced
to address a tig Wilson and Marshall
meeting here tonight.
The senator reviewed the achieve
ments of the Democratic administra
tion and then discussed at some length
Charles E. Hughes' criticism of the
railroad settlement, saying:
"Judge Hughes says there should
have been arbitration. I answer,
there was no law in existence provid
ing for arbitration. There was not
time to enforce any arbitration. I re
mind Judge Hughes that his party
came into power after Cleveland at
the end of the great Pullman car
strike.
"They were also in power when the
telegraphers had their universal strike.
But his party passed no law to pre
vent a repetition of such strikes or to
provide arbitration. I ask Judge
Hughes, under what law was there
to be arbitration? Who were to be
the arbitrators? And what does he
say would have been done to prevent
the strike while the attempt at arbi
tration which had been progressing
for months without success continued?
"Judge Hughes says the people will
pay. Why will the people pay any
more than they have been paying?
The railroads have already made the
people pay. The last returns by the
railroads, made under oath, show that
for the last railroad year, ending the
first of last month, 55 railroads, one
third of the total in the United States,
had made net over $1,000,000,000. If
it is true, as they claim, that $50,000,-
000 are to be taken from the public
to pay the increased wages under the
eight-hour law, which might give more
food, better clothes and better condi
tions to the toilers, let it be seen that
even the roads are still in possession
of a net profit of $950,000,000 and this
but one-third of them. Is not this
enough?"
PHILIP WISEMAN AND
WIFE ARE VISITORS
Philip Wiseman and wife of Los
Angeles are registered at the Bruns
wick Hotel in Kingman. Mr. Wise
man is the head of the United Eastern
Mining company and is here to look
over the property. The company is
getting its big milling plant lined up
and expects to have it in commission
within the next ninety days.
A few years ago Mr. Wiseman was
superintendent of the Banner mine,
at Stockton Hill, now incorporated in
the holdings of the Arizona Butte
Mines company and left that position
to go to Ray, where he is reputed to
have cleaned up about $2,000,000. In
the United Eastern, it would appear,
he will make as large a. cleanup.
