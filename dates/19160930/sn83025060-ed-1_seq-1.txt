LABOR VOTE NOT DELIVERABLE.
This Is the Outstanding Fact Which
Political Philosophers Deduce From
the Defeat in Maine of Repre
sentative McGllllcuddy.
From among tho numerous lesson
or, conclusions which the political phi
losophers can draw from the Maine
election one lesson or conclusion
stuntls out more sharply defined thun
ay other. It Jumps at you.
The labor vote, for the sake of
which the Poltroon Congress tarred
and feathered Itself wlUi Its own
hands only a dozen days ago, Is not
deliverable by the traders who pre
tended to sell It.
This salient fact of the election Is
Illustrated conspicuously In the Sec
ond ConRiess district. There are few
places within the confines of our
republic where labor is relatively
stronger than In tho city of Lewiston,
the homo city of Itcprcseiitallve Mc
Gllllcuddy, and he has made a spe
cialty of It In his own political piac
tlce. In the Second Maine, if any
where, would there bo Indications of
any return, In the shape of votes, for
the surrender of Congress to tho four
Brotherhoods. After a campulgn
which might almost be called desper
ate in Its effort to save McGllllcuddy
und ono Democratic seat In the House
from the Republican onset, Mr. Mc
Gllllcuddy was defeated by nn ad
verse plurality of nearly 400, whereas
he had beon elected to the Sixty
second Congress by n plurality of l.tlSi)
and to the Sixty-third by 1,281.

NOT AN EIQHT-HOUn LAW.
... ...
Recent Hold. Up Legislation Does
Not Shorten Workday a
Minute.
As n matter of fact, It Is not
bu eight-hour law at all. It does
not curtail tho trainmen's work
day by a single minute. If nn
engineer has been receiving $K
for working ten hours a day, this
law will raise his pay to 50.25;
but It will not shorten his woi It
day even the tenth part of a sec
ond. This Is no more like the
true eight-hour principle than
chalk is like cheese.
Tho reason why peoplo call
this an eight-hour law Is be
cause it says that la the case
of railroad trainmen they shall
get their day's pay for the first
eight hours' work, and all the
rest Is .to bo considered over
time. Do not tell mo that this strike.
could not have been called off or
postponed if President Wilson
had shown that he meant busi

believe that those four brotlwr
hood leaders started the hlta

put It out. One of them ad
mitted that he could put It oat
so far an his' o n brotherhood

to do so. Statement of Con
