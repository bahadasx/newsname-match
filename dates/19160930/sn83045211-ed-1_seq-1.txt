OPEN GRIDIRON SEASON AT PENN TODAY
FORTY-FIVE VILLAGES TAKEN
BY ALLIES SINCE LAUNCHING
OF GREAT SOMME DRIVE
LONDON, Sept. 80.
British troops Improved their positions
at Stuff redoubt, north of Thlepval, and
beat off German counter-attacks at the
Hessian trench last night, CJcneral Halg
reported this afternoon.
The fighting- In the latter placo was very
severe, despite a heavy downpour of rain
that converted the shell-wrecked trenches
Into great pools of mud and water In
which Germans and British fought.
The Germans shelled British, positions
south of the Ancre, from the Dentrcmont
farm to a point southwest of L.e Sars vil
lage, toward which Halg's men are ap
proaching. Despite this artillery attack, the
British continue to Improve tholr positions
on the whole Thlepval sector.
The French, today's official Tarls report
showed, made further progress north of
Rancourt last night, but elsewhere wero
held up by weather conditions.
South of Keuvillo St. Vaast the. British
made a successful raid last night
In the first thirteen weeks of tho Somme
offensive the JTrench and British have cap
tured more ground than has been taken by
the Germans In moro than six months of
battling at Verdun.
A survey of the results of the great
allied drive, halted, temporarily yesterday
by a, terrific downpour of rain, shows that
the Allies have reconquered 285 square
kilometers of French territory (about
ninety-two square miles), exceeding by fif
teen kilometers the territory gained by the
i Germans at Verdun.
Forty-flye villages, each one organized
Into a veritable fortress by the Teutons,
have fallen before the nattering of French
and British artillery. In every Instance
the demon position was so strong that
It had to be broken down by shell-fire be
fore Infantry could stormlt.
A total of 82,000 prisoners, 285 cannon,
halt of which are heavy artillery , pieces,
and more than one thousand machine guns

UP-TO-DATE STANDINGS
W. L. P.C.
Phillies 89 57 .60958
Brooklyn 90 59 .60402
These standings include morning
game.
By CHANDLER D. MCHTER
KBBETS FIELD, Brooklyn, Sept. JO.
Eppa Rtxey Pitched the Phillies Into first
place over the Dodgers In this morning's
game. The final score was 7 to 2.
Captain Fred Luderus was' the big noise,
with a homer, two doubles and three runs.
He also played a wonderful game on the
defense.
The box score shows three errors for the
Phillies and only one for Brooklyn, never
theless Pat Moran's champs really played
their greatest game when they completely
outclassed Brooklyn this morning and
went Into first place in the National Lcacuo
race by winning, 7 to 2,
It was apparent from the start that
Brooklyn was outclassed. Robinson's team
went to pieces after the Phillies had taken
the lead, and the former team's nerve and
fighting spirit vanished.
Grover Cleveland Alexander wanted to
pitch both games today, but after'tie and
Eppa Itlxey had. warmed up, Moran decided
that It was Itlxes day. Moran's judgment
In selecting Itlxey was justified, as the
fanky Virginian never looked better, lie
toyed with the lloblns throughout the game
and they only got five hts, two of which
were scratches and the two runs were
scored only because the Phils played the
game safe after getting an early lead.
As we prophetled this morning, Ed
Pf effer was a mark for the Phillies. Moran's
men hit and ran as they pleased and prob
ably would have doubled the score had It
been necessary,
A wonderful drive by Fred XUderus, who
played, the greatest gams ef 'his entire
career, easily was the feature of tlie game,
It the sixth Inning, Just when the Dedgsrs
had eewted upon staVng a rally, Luderus
took all the fight out of Reslnson's rnsn by
llftleg an awful smash overt he rlght-AeM
fence. It the same drive had been hit at
(ttilbe Park it would have landed, on the

Tragedy
NEPHEW HELPS DEFENSE
.Mrs. Joseph C. Io Due, of Chicago, who
was wounded In the Hotel Walton shooting,
when Sirs. Margaret Belzer, of New York,
shot and killed Joseph C. Oraveur, a New
York garage owner, and herself, will be set
freo by Coroner Knight 'at tho Inquest unless
unexpected developments come to light
Tho announcement was made today by
Coroner Knight at the same time that he
positively denied that any friction existed
between his ofilce and the Detective Bureau
over the manner In which tho police handled
the case.
"I shall set Mrs. Le Due at liberty at the
Inquest If the testimony given then tallies
with the facts now known." said the Cor
oner. "The action will, of course, be con
tingent upon the testimony presented at the
Inquest, but unless new testimony Is pre
sented which will materially alter the pres
ent status of the case, Mrs. Le Due will be
allowed to return to Chicago.
"I am not Interested in domestle affairs!
It makes no difference It Mrs. Le Due
knew Oraveur one year ago or two years
ago,"
Mrs. Le Due now Is under guard as a
material witness at the Jefferson Hospital,
a police guard having been detailed by
Captain of Detectives Tate, who decided
to hold her for the action of the coroner.
Ths Identity of the oft-mentioned
nephew of Mrs. Xe Due, with whom she
asserted she came to Philadelphia to visit,
became known today. Ha Is It R. IteutHn
ger, a coal dealer, with offices In the Com--merclal
Trust Building, and a home at 125
South Sixty-third street
Both he and Joseph C. Le Due, husband
of the wounded woman, today said that
It was their belief that Mrs. Lo Duo was
the victim of a "freme-up" on the part
of Oraveur, whom they accused ot using
her as a means to rid himself of the at
tentions of Mrs. Belzer, spurned hy the
garage man. Iteutllnger corroborated part
of Mrs. Le Due's story, to the effect that
she did come to Philadelphia, to visit him
and did not accompany Oraveur to Atlantlo
City and Phlladelpha.
DINED WITH GlUVKUn.
"My aunt came to Philadelphia Friday
to visit me atid my wife," said Iteutllnger.
"She came to the house Friday and re
malned here until Tuesday afternoon, some
ten hours before the shooting, Tuesday
afternoon about 3 o'clock she received a
telephone message from Oraveur, Inviting
her to take dinner with him. She accepted.
"Before leaving our house Mrs. Le Duo
told my wife that she Intended taking a
9 o'clock train for New York after dinner.
It she missed the train, however, she said,
she would return to ths house for the night
She took her handbag with her, That
was ths last we heard of her until ths
trsgedy bscams known.

(Coprrltht. llt.)
TAUIS, Sept. 2 J. It "wns my prlvlleee t
day to obtain an Interview with an eminent
Frenchman, a diplomat of International re
nown, n, .historian and man of letters, -who,
with voice and pen, has perhaps con
tributed, more than any single individual to
the cause of France alnco the beginning; of
the war Gabriel Hanotaux, of the Aca
deme Francalse, and ex-Forelen Secretary
of France.
WM. Hanotaux received me in the salon of
his apartment In l'arls, and, after speaklnr
feelingly ot the appreciation of France and'
Frenchmen at the many evidences of Amer
ican sympathy with tho cause for which
his country Is flghttnrr, he turned to the
question uppermost 'In his mind, the entry
of numanln. Into the war upon the side of
France and her allies.
"I think," he said, "that the Balkan situa
tion In ths entry of Rumania Into the con
flict has reached its most significant climax,
and with It the turning point of all ths
Balkan future. In my opinion, the taking
up of arms against our enemies by Rumania
determines, under existing and co-operating
circumstances, tho destiny of the Balkan
Peninsula. This, ot course, was clarified'
ill iaisq uifcivu uy ..o uftivuiuua vmijr ui .i:
Bulgaria Into the war upon the aids ox T
the Teutonic allies. But now It Is writ
Urge nnd clear upon tho wall.
"Previous to Bulgaria's taking up arms,
the eternal principle of the Balkan Penin
sula for the Balkans was seemingly Im- ' 'i
possible of satisfactory solution, because of
the temperaments ot four nations, each of
about equal strength and each with dif
ference Ideas as to Its particular methods'
of seeking happiness; for the seeking of,
happiness .In some form Is, after all, tho
uUhnato aim of all diplomacy, of alt' po
litical dispute and of all (he wars history
records, as fully as It Is the alpha an-t
omega of the Individual, be his face what
It may.
DOOM OF BULaARlA
"I say four , nations, because we can,
leave Turkey out and consider only Bul
garia, Serbia, Greece and Rumania. Bui-,
curia has sealed her own doom, and In the
sealing has relieved the general political
situation In the Balkans of one of Its
most vexatious problems the sentimental
associations that, through Slavic blood, ex
isted between Bulgaria and Russia. The
Russians are no longer under the Illusion
of a blood tie with Bulgaria.. The most
Slavophile of the Russian empire have real-,
lied and sensed the evidences before them
of Bulgarian Ingratitude. With Rusla
and the Russians the sentiments of blood
and race ties with Bulgaria can no longer
act as a' factor In the consideration of any,
Balkan diplomatic or political question.
For good and all that point Is settled, la
my opinion.
"Greece, deceived and cajoled by a politi
cal Intrigue that practically purchased Its
end, took the line of passive resistance,
which might wclL even now, make her
