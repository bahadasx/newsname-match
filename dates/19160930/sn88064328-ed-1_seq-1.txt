THE PARISH FAIR.
THOUSANDS SAW THE EXHIBITS.
It must b e a source of gratifica
tion to the Board of Directors
the Parish Fair Association that
their efforts this year, to give the
people of this section a Parish
Fair that would do justice to any
section of the United States has
met with such response 011 the
part of the people in
The doors of the Fair were thrown
open to visitors on Thursday
morning, although many of the
exhibitors did not uet their ex
hibits placed until later on in the
afternoon, thinking they would
have ample time to have their ex
hibits seen bv the throngs who
were expected. The first days
attendance was not near as large
as was anticipated, but this can
readily be accounted for because
it will be open to the public until
to-morrow nisrht. Every depart
ment. with possihlv the exception
of the live stocik. showed a larser
number of entries, but this be
sneaks much for the farmers of
Iberia. St. Martin and St. Marv
as no effort was made this
to secure stock from more distant
points, as was done last season.
The exhibits are purely local and
it shows to what extent our sec
tion has thrived alonar agricul
tural lines. The corn, the cane,
the cotton as well as hundreds of
other varieties of forage crops
and vegetables, all seemed to sur
pass the displays of last year.
Every farmer that could find it
convenient to send in something
did his best to help swell the dis
plays, and not only did they send
' in their products, but many of
them volunteered their services
to assist the committee on manage
ment in making the show a suc
cess. As we go to press nearly
every business house in New 'Ibe
ria is beautifully decorated and
an air of welcome predominates
every establishment in our City, j
Plenty of ice water is being dis- '
pensed free to every one
wants to quench their thirst, and |
we are satisfied none of our vis-J
itors who have taken the trouble!
to come to New Iberia will regret j
their visit to our hospitable little
City. One of the noticeable
facts about the Fair is that
that every citizen of our Parish
and Citv feels that the Fair, as,
conducted by the Board of man
a «rement, is everybody's Fair and
no one, two or dozen individuals
are trying to get the credit for
it. Those of our citizens who
did not make financial contribu
tions towards its success have
£iven their own personal time to
assist tho Board, or brought out
some relic and placed it on exhi
bition to show their interest in its
.-uccess. After all, without the
concerted help of every citizen
the Fair would never be the un
fiualified success that it is. and
contributions in money—while es
sentiallv necessarv. without the

would not go far in making a
of'food showing. Up to going to
press the attendance has been
exceedingly good, but to-day and
I Sunday there should be without
I any exaggeration, fully fifteen
thousand people in New Iberia
j witnessing the remarkable ex
general.!hibits on display. .Excursions
from every point from Port Ar
thur, 1 exas, east, a s far as ->e\\
Orleans will bring in thousands
of people and we feel assured
every one of them will be sur
prised at the second efforts of the
citizens of this Parish to hold a
demonstration of this kind.
Among those of our business
men who have booths at the Fair.
advertising the different articles
manufactured in this City and,
hereabouts, our special reporter,
(who tried not to overlook any
one), handed in the following as
we closed our forms on Fridav

do credit to anv State Fair in the!

of anv one and none should miss
