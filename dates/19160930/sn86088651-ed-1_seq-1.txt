Seven years ago today the First
Stale Bank and Trust Company of
Bryan was organized and opened Its
doors for business, I'ndcr tho watch
ful and keen f ye of Its president, Mr.
Ed Hall, the Institution has with the
motto, "Service and Safety," prosper
ed and grown to be one of the largest
tate banking Institutions In Texas.
At the close of business last night, tho
last day of seven years In business,
the announcement was made that a
little mora than one half million dol
lars' was on deposit ny cltlxens of
Braios and adjoining counties, which
is evidence Itself that all faith and
confidence la placed In the heads of
this concern.
At the time the bank was organized
the capltel stock was $."0,000 and now
It Is 1100.000, with 123.000 surplus and
undivided profits. At the, time of the
organization Mr. Ed Hall was select
ed by the board of directors as their
leader, their president, and this gen
tleman has so conducted the affairs
of the bank that he has succeeded
lmactf each year at the annual elec
tion of officers, the same applying to
Mr. W. II. Cole., who has been cashier
since , the organization. Mr. R. H.
Seale of Denrhlcy has also been re
tained as a vice president since the
bank was opened.
The oMcers of this Institution have
also as helpers In making the bank
what It Is, Mr. J. Nelson Dulaney,
whose record as bookkeeper for them
has been excellent, and a new addi
tion Is Mr. Pat Newton, whose affable
disposition will no doubt cause his
advancement In this Institution right
from the start.
The growth of this bank is attribut
ed to many sources. The fact that Its
management has been Ideal, the cour
tesies they have extended their pa
trons, the aafety they offer their de
positors and a number of other
things could be mentioned, coupled
with the fact that they are located in
the best town on the map and In the
best county In Texas, could all be
given as reasons for Its great pros
perity. The present directorate Is composed
of the following gentlemen: John YV.
Coulter, J. n. 8andera. H. P. Dansby.
Samuel Ivy, E. J. Jenkins. Walter J.
Coulter. R. II. 8ea1e,YY. H. Cole and
