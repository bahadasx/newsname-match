KATE DREXEL DEVOTES LIFE
AND FORTUNE TO MISSION
, WORK.
The Woman Who Has Spent Thirty 1
Years in Uplighting Negro and I
Indian Children Would Have
Preferred to Ride on a
Street Car.
Mother Katherine, formerly Miss
Kate Krexel of Philadelphia, who has
given her life and 7 million dollars
to the work of educating and uplift
ing. nerQ and Indian, children-, stopped
off in Kansas "City today from 7 to 11
o'clock, to visit St. Monica Mission,
Seventeenth street and Lydia avenue.
The little negro mission was filled
during th ose hours by a stream oi
parishioners, principally women, who
called to touch the fingers of the veiled
figure and receive her blessing. For
Mother Katherine really Is the patron
saint of St. Monica Mission. Part of
the Drexel millians bought the ground
on which the little mission stands, and
her life has been the Inspiring factor
In St. Monica's church and school
work.
Wanted to Use Street Car.
Modest, retiring, self-effacing. Moth
er Katherine murmured a protest
when a huge green motor car m'et her
at the Union Station. She preferred
to ride on the street car. she said.
But her protest was overruled and the
motor car carried her direct to the
mission door. She wore the simple
black habit of Catholic sisterhood,
with nothing to distinguish her as the
head of the Order of the Blessed
Sacrament, which she founded.
Back of her assumed humanity, how
ever, there was a forcefulness ot pur
pose and action that might have been
characteristic of the Drexels. Con
cealed beneath her black hood and
starched collar was a spark of energy
and initiative that bespoko the power
and ability to organize.
A Chain of Missions.

votion to her work the last twenty
years. Her vow provides that she

its leadership to take the country
along the way of adaptation to new

should have no pride In representing
it. But the party of Lincoln is re
united today and we cossecrato it to
tho Ideals ot Lincoln, and those Ideals
are permanent. These are the ideals
ot the success of the plain people.
They are the Ideals ot the achieve

LINCOLN'S HOME.
Washington, D. C The cabin
which was Lincoln's first home, now
standing on its original site near
Hodgensvilie, Kq., became the other
day the property of the Nation. A
man who sees it, and later sees the
completed great marble memorial to
Lincoln on the bank of the Potomac
at Washington, will have seen typical
edifices of the most symbolic career
yet known to the republic.
The one Is ten logs high on a side,
is plastered with soil and has an
outer chimney of logs, sticks and
mud. The other is to cost millions,
be made and adorned by artists of
distinction, and become, next to Mt
Vernon, the homo of Washington, the
most frequented of all American civic
temples.
What enduring monuments these
are, not only to Lincoln, but to the
10,000,000 Black men and women and
children in America it was because
of the Emancipation Proclamation
that Lincoln will longest be remembered.
