BERLIN, Sept. 30. The most influentiil orpns throughout Get

important bearing on the future conduct of the war.

attacks on American neutrality appear'
Helchitag speech on Thursday.
Amonar thoee nh itmt
meeting of this main committee of
the Reichstag besides the Chancellor
were Foreign Secretary on Jago.,
Vice Chancellor Helrferleb, Admiral
von Ca pll, successor to von Tirplta;
Dr. Llsco, Secretary of Justice, and
Count von Hoedsrn. Secretary of tne
Treasury.
On tha avtcome of this conference
will depend whether Dethmann-IIotl-wss;'s
opponents will continue to wage
open war on Mm when the Helchstag
reconvenes next week.
Though levers! newspaper critics
attacked the Chancellor for falling to
outline more specifically the Govern
ment's intentions toward England In
his Reichstag speech, these sentiments
were not shared by the majority of Ms
H'lehitag opponents. They realised,
they said before to-day's conference be
gan, that the Chancellor was speaking
under the greatest dlfBculUts. with
hostile nem-spspers waiting to pounce
on any utterance and misconstrue It
to suit their own ends.
The Chancellor's supporters wer
confident that in a frank talk In pri
vate with tha Ht-lchslag commission
to-day he would silence the attacks
of the majority of his critics. If he
falls to do so, Uethmann-Hollweg
does not Intend to remain on the do
finslve, they said. If necessary he
will go before tho Hetchstag again,
with a. public address Justifying hu
course. The Chancellor is known to
have the support of von Hlndonburg
and a strong bold on popular opiulon.
Tho newapapora are making their
demand for the vlgcroua renewal of
U-boat operatlor.r because of tho ac
tivities of the American ao.'ll squad
ron in the French army and tho con
tinued shipment of war munitions to
the allies.
