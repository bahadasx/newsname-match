The Golden Beit Fair
FROM THURSDAY'S DAILY
The Golden Belt Fair grour.d has the
most artistically picturesque setting,
and is perhaps' the most perfectly or
dered fair ground in America. People
from other states, those who are used to
seeiDg fairs that have taken a hundred
years to design and deve.lop, are free to j
say, "We have never seen anything like
this." Even a Hutchinson man and j
men from this city claim ever3Tthing in j
sight took off his hat and exclaimed j
"You have us skinned a mile!"
If you will go to the large open win- i
dow of the Fort Hays Normal building 1
and study the view obtained from i
there, your artistic passion will be j
stirred. I call your attention to the
sweeping, meandering Big Creek which
is set all about with oaks, elms, and
hackberry trees. Many of these trees
are hundreds of years old and have
branches stretching for seventy-five
feet, making a canopy of living beauty.
Further to the South, the remains of
the rrim old fort rears its bristling
head, reminding you of early border
days, when Custer, Sheridan, and big
red Indians were contesting the rights
of this eminent domain. The great
Experimental Station .with its hun
dreds of buildings, plots and designs
add much to the landscape. If you
will look to the west, just as the sun
is setting you will behold the great
white piles of stone representing the
Fort Hays Normal. -Standing to the
left of this striking scene is the mag
nificent new Sheridan Coliseum and
further to the west, the administration
Duilding, library and high school agri
cultural hall stand out in their beauty.
Now look to the north, and the city of
Hays presents -a. view that would make
an artist rejoice. There before you
looms the High School building, St.
Joseph's church, while the tall water
towers stand up above the city like an
cient sentinels guardingthe v approach;
while the 250,000 bushel elevator white
and beautiful .speaks of Ellis county
prosperity. The hum of the 1,000 bar
rel mill can be distinctly heard.
The fair grounds have 40 acres of
perfectly level sod dotted here and
there by stock barns, administration
building, the Fort Hays Normal build
ing, a grand stand that will seat 3,500
people and a" half mile track that is not
surpassed west of the Mississsippi.
The fair ia now on. Thousands upon
thousands of people are pouring through
the gates, dressed in gala attire,
all wearing smiles of good cheer, all
with pockets full.of coin to spend, as
they pass down the Golden Belt Mid
way. If you are a student of human nature,
J you have your chance to study the
j psychology of the crowd. Tha boys
I like the duck pond, the girls tb.3 rner-
ry-go-round what would a county fair
be without a honking, squeaking, hum
ming merry-go-round? and the old
men spend their time discussing cattle,
hogs, farm machinery, wheat and the
pumpkin display each according to in
terest and taste.
But if you want to go where things
are doing, where each exhibit ha3 on
its finest dress and is most appealing
to the "inner man" as well as to his
love for the beautiful, just spend an
hour in the culinary v department. It
truly would be gratifying to know that
all "good eats" were always as invifc
ing as the display at this fair. But
never aain will the eocd women of
the coanty go back to poor cooking
since this week's showing. No more
burnt bread, tough steaks, poorly pre
pared canned stun"; no more poor cakes
and heavy doughnuts. The fair has
"opened our eyes" and the men are re
joicing as never before because of this
cooking display and its inspiration to
the housewife.
If you are interested in tatting, quilt
ing, though being a mere man, we
never could see any sense in crochet
ing and other fine flummadoodles,
then go to the domestic art section and
you will weep for joy.
Any old eastern "rube" who thinks
the west has no bjaatifal tradi
tionsold things, worn out things, but
most valuable because of ancient asso
ciations, would have been "awfully
fooled" if he had spent an hour rum
maging about the fine art department.
This department also includes - china
and mural paintings and flowers. It
was a "thing of beauty and a joy
forever."
NOTES
What would the fair be without the
everlasting toot, whistle, jangle and
whirr of the old merry-go-round?
Most people like the crazy thing, but
I no one can tell why.
The paw-paws displayed by Mr.
George Hubbell were a curiosity to
most folks. But if you had been
watching you could tell the people who
werejrora Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky
and Tennessee, as they passed this
fruit. They knew, for the most of
them that came from these" states
were raised on paw-paws.
The collection of Kansas antiques by
Prof. Ward Sullivan of the Normal, at
tracted much attention. It was kind
of Mr. Sullivan to make such a fine
showing for the " curious eyes of the
general public. - . -
.Much executive ability has been
manifest in this fair ground business.
It is wonderful what one man like
C. G. Cochran can do for a community.
Four years ago this county was living
in little cliques and clan with pride pre
judices that were almost appalling, but
one big man, with a real soul of pro
gress came into our business world and
today all misunderstandings are vanish
ing away, and we are beholding the old
passing and the new coming because
one man took an interest in a county's
welfare. There will be no more fights
for place, and politics and little things
are giving away to brotherhood.
I am sure rubber bails, wife-beaters
and confetti should not be. permitted to
be sold on the ground. They seem to
make the crowd uneasy, and in many
instances they become very offensive.
It was a striking feature to see Bill
Philip Alex Philip aad George Philip
ride their slow steeds over the ground,
giving direction to make things go.
W alter Miller won first prize in curios
in the boy's department. Walter has
spent mucn time in mamng ms collec
tion. He is to be congratulated. Not
many young boys take such an interest
in antiques.
The blacksmith display made by Mr. !
Wood, of the Normal, was very favor-'
ably commented upon by the passing
farmers. They saw m this work what
their boys were getting while attending
the Normal and under his instruction.
The "get together" spirit manifested
by all classes was highly demonstrated.
It must be given to C. G. Cochran for
this development of community interest.
Now if the spirit of the Golden Belt
can do so much for us, what will we be
able to do when we move for bigger
things in the future for community
interest?
P. J. Deane, the secretary, has prov
en himself to be the right man. It
takes a secretary to make a fair ground
job a success. "Three cheers and a
tiger for Deane!
The time and energy used by George
Philip, Jr. show that the president was
weK chosen. He is a man of good busi
ness ability. Keep him in his office.
Rooks county came to "the fair on
Thursday. 200 cars were parked.
1000 were from that county as visitors.
Now that is real neighborly. We were
glad to see you, and remember next
year we will be at Stockton. Sush
county visiting makes for bigger and
better Kansas.
That little scout who "fearlessly ran
up the flag staff and planted "old
glory" so it could fly to the breeze on
Wednesday afternoon, was cheered to
the echo by the thousands who wit
nessed it and then the band played
"The Star Spangled Banner" and
every one in the grand stand, arose a3
one man.
There was an old man down on the
grounds who is thought to be almost
blind when walking on the streets of
the city. He cannot tell a friend a rod
away, but when the horses were coming
do wn the track, their noses looking like
a row of marbles, the blood of contest
commenced to stir his veins, he jumped
up and shouted, "I'll bet ten on the
gray"! WThen a county-fair will make
the blind to see, you may rest assured
it is a good thing.
While we appreciate the big pump
kins, nicely plumed chickens, too fat
to squeal pigs, well grccmed horses
and beef cattle, they are not in it when
you ccme to stud7 the fair. To my no
tion the community work done through
the Boy Scouts under the direction of
Mr.Harris.Mr.Frey and Mr. McKnight,
is far more beneScal, helpful. and far-
reaching than any display made at the
fair. The splendid work, the keen com
petition, the patriotic enthusiasm, the
courteous u.gmLy nu tu Ku
cai enaurance maiuiesi u&e it aii ia i
li was the most promising, up-lifting
and lasting of anything shown during
tha wonderful fair week.
Butts-In&keep.
Miss Zetta Butts, daughter of Hr.
and Mrs. VT. D. Butt3 of this city, was
married to Mr. Frank Inskeep of Co
Ijmbu?, Ohio, Thursday evening, the
twenty-first, at the home of her father.
It was a quiet home wedding, only
her immediate relatives and a few girl
friends were present.
The bride wore a beautiful gown of
white crepe meteor, with lace and chif-
fon trimmings. - Her bouquet was of
deep cream roses and the bridal wreath
was of white forget-me-nots.
Mis3 Fern Reemsnyder, a -classmate
of the bride, acted as bridesmaid and
was dressed in nile green crepe de ehine.
Mr. William Shutts was best man.
At six o'clock the assembled guest3 J
gathered in the reception room, and as i
Miss Lueile Felten played Lohengrin s j
wedding inarch, the bride and groom -
and their attendants took their places j
under an arch of smilax and asters I
banked with ferns. '
The ceremony was performed by!
Rev. E. O. Rogers, p'astor of the Bap-1
tist church, who used the beautiful ring j
service. j

WHY CHILDREN HAVE ADENOIDS.
Many authors tell of the trouble
caused by adenoids, but there they stop,
they do not go on back and explain why
adenoids exist.
These abnormal growths of tissue in
children cause ceafness, earache, in
distinct enunciation, stuttering or stam
mering enuresis, m outh-breathing and
snoring at night.
Everyone is familiar with the poor
little drawn face, with its pinched ex
pression. The -lips are usually thick
and swollen.
Of.course no one child has all of these
symptons, but every case of adenoids
has some of them. The severity of the
symptons depend upon the location, as
well as the extent of the growth, for
instance: if the growth were at the
enstanchean orifice a very small area
being involved would produce deafness.
A large area elsewhere would not effect
the hearing.
Children who have adenoids have fre
quent colds and bronchial trouble. hey
are also much less immune to contage
ous diseases than others.
Authorities on childrens diseases will
tell you all the above and will advocate
operation. They will, also state that,
"in spite of the most careful operation
adenoids will frequently recur."
They have told you nothing of the
etiology of adenoids.
Osteopathy explains the presence of
adenoid growth and remover the cause
for it, this being eliminated there can
be no recurrence.
In infancy and childhood just a3 in
young plant life, the tissues are very
tender and susceptible to change and
outware influence. Exposure, catching
severe cold3. unsuitable diet, are con
tributing causes of these growths, but
the real primary cause in nearly every
case is some form of injury to the tis
sues about the neck, upper part of the
chest, or shoulders.
This injury may occur at birth
through some unavoidable difficulty and
will not be known at the time. Every
child from the time it is born is having
all sorts of falls off of beds, couch
es, out of chairs, all of these are
forgotten as soon as baby's crying
stops, but very few get through this
age without injuries of more or les3
importance. Some of the little ribs,
or collar bone, are wrenched or twisted.
Falling on heads or shoulders causes a
violent wrenching and straining of the
vertebrae and tender muscles and other
tissues of the neck and throat. j
In babies and children the lymph!
glands are relatively much larger and i
more numeroue than in adults. The
lymph and blood vessels in growing !
children are very tender and suscepti-
ble to change. Injury of the neck will
interfere with the vasomotor nerves
(controlling size of vessels) causing a
change in the 'caliber of the vessels in
she naso-pharynx (membrane at the
back part of the nasal passages and
mouth.)
Irritation to the motor nerves caused
by colds, fatigue or injury produces
muscular contraction which in turn
makes pressure upon the blood and
lymph vessels. Cell formation is so ix
pii in a small child, that if for any
reason too much blood, unless it be in
active inflammation, is kept in one re
gion, it causes abnormal growth. This
is what occurs in the adenoid tissue of
the naso-pharyngeal membrane.
Osteopathic treatment will correct j
the position of the ribs and clavicles I
(collar iones,) relax and normalize the
j tissues of the neck and throat, allowing
!
a free and natural flow of blood end
lymph. This will usually cause the ade
noid growth to disappear or reduce it in
size until it will cau3e no further trou
ble. If it is necessary to remove some
remaining tissue after treatment is fin
ished, there will be no danger of recur
rence, the primary cause having been
removed. Dr. T. H. Clover.
The first day of the Golden Belt Fair
W2s a success. Thousands thronged
the Midway till a late hour last night
and the management labored until the
"wee sma" hours to prepare for to
day's events. No stone . was left un
turned in preparation for the crowds
which swarm up and down the Midway.
Added attractions, new entries, better
accommodations are the thoughts that
are uppermost in the minds of the
management. The financial system has
been brought to a science and all indi-
cations are for one of the biggest fairs j
in the state, not excepting the state
fair. Free telephone service ha3 been
furnished by the united telephone Co.,
and each" building has a telephone. A
real rest room ha3 been provided in the
Normal building the kind for tired
people who only want to rest with
rocking chairs and fan3 and music, ard
at the came time a view of the entire
fair eroun&a. Tea is served hv rtrettv

. THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK
A Sudden Death.
There is a great shock that comes to
a community when they hear of a strong
robust person taken away by death
without warning. Such was the case
Sunday morning when the death of
Alex Brungardt of Victoria, was made
known. Mr. Brungardt is a son of P. I
P. Brungardt. A member of a great
family that is so well and favorably
known in this county. They have been
identified with the growth and progress
of Ellis Count- for a number of years.
Mr. Brungardt had beento Kansas
City, to bring home a motor oil track
used by the Standard Oil Company, in
whose employ he has been engaged for
some time. He was accompanied by
John Brungardt a cousin3 son. They
stopped at Manhattan for lunch and he
ate some canned fish which contained
the deadly poison. He was taken with
severe cramps shortly after eating.
They resumed their journey homeward
and reached Salina, where they went
immediately to Dr. Brungardt, a
brother of Mr. Brungardt. Miss Brun
gardt a sister, was also there. A physi
cian was hastily summoned, he pro
nounced it ptomain poisoning. It's
said he felt better after being
treated and wished to continue his
journey but was persuaded to re
main and never regained consciousness
again. He died at about six o'clock
Saturday evening. Mr. Alex Brun
gardt was forty-five years old. He is
the father of eleven living children.
A sister teaching in the schools of An
tonino, is a member of hi3 family. The
funeral occurred Tuesday morning at
Herzog. Mr. Erungart was a member of
the Kniehts of Columbus and a number j
of the members of that organization

The sympathy of all goes out to to the

of N. M. Schlyer of this city, was knock

is not otherwise injured. She is doing
nicely and if no complications set in
will soon recover.
Howard Marty is here from Sharon

Howard, as a musician, a band organ
