BY LEON STARMONT.
Detroit, Mich., Sept. 29.—Detroit is
spending money like a magnified and
highly veneered western mining
town!
Spending her money—and getting
her money's worth.
Rents are soaring to New York
prices—but houses and flats are not
the thin shells built-to-order in most
towns growing rapidly.
Clothes come high, but Detroit for
years has boasted of being six or
eight months ahead of Chicago in
fashions.
Face Massage.
A "face massage" costs 5ft cents,
but covers the upper chest and back
of the neck.
There are three-cent oar linen here,
but most regular Detroiters pay a
nickel for 4-cent service.
Detroit claims the classiest night
life between the coasts!
This centers about the Japanese
room in the Cadillac, where a run­
way provides a platform for chorus
girls and dancing and singing prin­
cipals to approach the tables closely.
Between numbers on the runway, the
patrons trip the latest dances.
Henry P. Stumme, maitre d'hotel,
formerly of the Statler in Cleveland,
says money flows in a steady stream
in Detroit, and everybody, seems to
JlUVH it.
There's a noisier crowd in the Cafe
Frontenac, under the Berghoff. Here
a pickaninny in gold and brass pulls
aside a silken cord to let you pass.
Ragging steps are popular. A "na­
ture dancer" in a filmy cloud, pos­
tures and twists for the wine-fed audi­
ence.
The flamingo room of the Pontchar
trian is as full of ankles as Chicago's
"Peacock alley."
Downtown streets are alive with
ogling eyes. Washinglton-blvd., tihe
"great dark way," between the Tul
ler and the Cadillac, is filled with cou­
ples making dates.
The recently reopened segregated
district is populous and prosperous.
Sunday is as wide open as any
other day.
At the same time Detroit has the
largest Y. M. C. A. in the world, with
7.300 members.
Billy Sunday There.
After Billy Sunday came to town
one favorite night spot was closed
—the roof garden of the Tuller. But
Lew Tuller says Sunday had nothing
to do with this.
Woodwarfl-av. from the Campus
Martius far beyond the ford plant
in Highland park is a continuous 10
mile stream of automobiles. So is the
boulevard* which encircles the town.
Tom Waugh, who pulls an express
train to Grand Rapids and back, ex­
presses the laboring man's love for
the "miracle city"—"It's the one city
where the man who works can drive
his own car, and afford to!"
Detroit is preparing to spread its
through a "country clearing house"
that shall act for the banks of the
state, according- to ftobert Locke,
manager of the Detroit Clearing House
association, which is fathering the
new plan.
Theatrical men call Detroit the best
show town in America. A week's
business of $20,000 is not unusual.
B. C. Whitney is preparing to build
a million-dollar opera house.
Millionaires are made over-night,
or at least between ends of a year.
The town is full of young men who
used to be clerks or mechanics, and
who get in right in the auto game,
or stoves or steel or real estate.
Norvell Hawkins and B. F. Steph­
enson, Ford aides, became rich by the
simple plan of buying a farm and pro­
jecting a street railway through it.
In 1905 there was a real estate
boom. Building lots were sold 'way
out beyond the boulevard. In a year
or so the buyers began kicking them­
selves. About 20 per cent of the pur­
chasers held on, and took over their
neighbors' property. Today these lots
are covered by fine residences or auto
factories.
Nowadays stenographers and me­
chanics and drygoods clerks are sell­
ing real estate on the side, and many
of them making mop«jy at it.
WILL ERECT $20,000 PLANT
Jamestown, N. D., Sept. 29.—Ed­
ward Senkmp, owner of the Ellendale
Creamery company, has announced
that he will erect a $20,000 plant in
that city, plans and specifications
which will soon be out, to care for
his increase in business.
Reporter
EDITOR OF PAPER
IS ALSO ARRESTED
Thompson Falls, Mont.. Sept. 29.—
A. C. Thomas, chairman of the Re­
publican central committee of Sanders
county, died in a hospital at Missoula
today, from a pistol shot fired by
Miss Edith Colby, a reporter on a
local paper. Miss Colby is in jail.
Makes No Statement.
Thomas died without making any
statement regarding the shooting.
Senator Edward Donlan, of Missoula,
a friend of Thomas, said the affair
was the result of a long political fight.
The preliminary hearing of Miss
Colby was continued today until Oc­
tober 5.
An attorney from Spokane arrived
here to defend Miss Colby, and on
his advice she did not enter a plea
when taken into court. She did not
ask to be released on bail and was
returned to jail. Thomas' body will
be returned here from Missoula to­
morrow for burial.
Editor Also Arrested.
Miss Colby has stated that Thom­
as had made remarks that reflected on
her character. J. Manire, editor of
the newspaper that employed Miss
Colby, also has been arrested and is
in jail. The sheriff announced that
he had been told by Miss Colby that
Manire had advised her to kill Thom­
as, who was opposed politically to
Manire.
COURTENAY RESIDENTS MISS
USUAL MORNING HOWL
Jamestown, N. D., Sept. 29.—A howl
once familiar to every resident of
Courtenay and which was heard on
every Sunday morning for years, was
missed last Sunday for the first time
in several years.
It was customary with the ringing
of the bell for Douglas, a dog owned
by Loran Nichols of the village, to
set up a howl which lasted during the
time that bell was rung.
Douglas died last week much to the
satisfaction of the residents of the
village.

Off Maine Coast

Fisherman Sees What He Be­

Vessel
Portland, Me., Sept. 29.—A life pre­
server marked "Bremen," the name of
the German submarine freighter,
which has been generally expected to
arrive at some Atlantic Coast port
for the last week or more, was picked
up on the ocean side of Cape Eliza­
beth today.
The name "Bremen" was stenciled
in black letters two inches high' on
both sides of the Buoy. Qn one side
of the canvas covering was printed
a small crown.
Over this were the words "Shutz
Marke," meaning patented, or trade­
mark. Beneath were the words, "V.
Epping-hoven, Wilhelmshaven." This
indicated apparently the name of the
maker.
Preserver Appears New.
The preserver seemed to he new
and apparently had not been in the
water a great length of time. It was
stained with oil. An officer of the
coast guard cutter service, who ex­
amined the buoy, said that if the
preserver had been thrown overboard
by someone thought to play a practical
joke, he had done a very goocj job.
The preserver was well jnade and
the lettering and the ink were of the
best quality.
Buoy Is Photographed.
The buoy was picked up at a small
place known as Maiden Cove, by a
ten year old lad, of Westbrook. A
number of other persons were near
at the time and saw the boy pick up
the object from the beach near the
water's edge. Later, it was taken
to a newspaper office, w.hei f* it wa«
photographed and examined by many
seafaring men.
Sights Submarine.
Westerly, 11. I., Sept. 29.—A fisher­
man at. Pleasant View, near Watch
Hill, overlooking Long Island Sound,
reported tonight that he had seen
with his marine glasses, a large suo
marine proceeding in the direction of
New London, where the German sub­
marine, Bremen, has been expected
for more than a week. She was then
27 miles east of New London and
showed on her mast a bright., white
light above a green light.
These lights, according to the ob­
server, were the ones he had been
told by Captain Robinson, of the tug,
Westerly, would be carried by the
German submarine, which the tug
some days ago had been ordered to
look for.
The submarine was unaccompanied
and displayed no flag. The observer,
who professed to be familiar with the
appearance of American submarines,
which have their base at New Lon­
don, said she was of a different type
from any he had seen. The boat was
about two miles off shore and was
going at a moderate rate of speed.
The sea was very choppy.
WILL HOLD LAND SALE
Jamestown, N. D., Sept. 29.—Super­
intendent Covey in charge of the

EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY
Hornell, N. Y„ Sept. 29.—Charles E.
Hughes vent through the southern
tier of countios in New York state
today, over his political battleground
of ten years ago. He spoke in four
cities and greeted with handshakes
or a few words, ten audiences in
smaller towns.
Mr. Hughes repeated his views on
the protective tariff, the Adamson
1
law, the maintenance of American
rights and other issues of the cam­
paign. He again assailed the admin­
istration for "surrender to force," for
"broken pledges," and for "extrava­
gant claims."
In his speech at Binghamton and
again at Elmira and Corning, the nom­
inee went further than he had gone
in making known his views on the
eight hour day.
"I am not opposed to the principle
of the eight hour day," Mr. Hughes
said. "1 favor the general principle
of the eight hour day. I should like
to see an eight hour work day."

Austro-Germans Repulse Rou­

Sector
London, Sept. 29.—Steadily the Brit*
ish troops are pushing forward to*
ward the Peronne-Bapume road, the
main artery immediately behind tbe
German lines north of Combles. Af­
ter taking five hundred yards of
trenches southwest of Lesars, General
Sir Douglas Haig's men made addi­
tional progress in the capture of five
hundred yards of German trenches
east of Lesbouefs.
The British occupancy of the terri­
tory between Thiepval and the Ancre
is being contested strongly by tbe
Germans. A German counter attack,
after the entry of the British into a
section of the Hessian trench, result­
ed in the forcing out of the holders.
The section was regained later, how­
ever, by the British, London says.
Heavy fighting also has occurred
around the Stuff redoubt.
Rain Hampers Operations,
There has been no great activity on
any of the other fronts in Europe,
except in fransylvania, where the
Austro-Germans have repulsed the
Roumanians at Hermanstadt. Vienna
.also says the Teutonic forces have
occupied the heights east and south
least of the town after violent fight*
ing. The battle in this Bection, how
,ever, has not yet been finished.
I The intense fighting in the region
of Korynltza, on the eastern front tat
Russia, appears to. have come to an
*nd.f Beilm and Vienna says that
the Russian prisoners have increased
to 41 officers, and 3,600 men. The
forces under Prince Leopold of Bava­
ria here also took two cannon and
thirty-three machine guns. Berlin
records the repulse of a Russian ad­
vance near Goduzischki, and Petrograd
claims the defeat of a German attack
near Gukalof. Fighting continues In
the Carpathians, but there has been
no change in the battle line.
In Macedonia the Entente allied
troops are withstanding Bulgarian at­
tacks. The Serbians have checked
four attacks against positions on the
Kaimakielan plateau and the French
have withstood assaults along the
Broda river.
Efforts are Fruitless.
Crown Prince Rupprecht, of Bava­
ria, commander of the German forces
on the Somme front, and Dr. von
Bethmann Hollwegg, the Imperial
Chancellor, both declare that the ef­
forts of the French and British to
force a breach in the German lines
on the Somme have been fruitless.
The Entente troops will have to go
somme and continue their efforts next
year, Crown Prince Ruppercht is
quoted as saying. The Imperial Chan­
cellor, in an address to the Reichstag,
declared that the German front there
"stands firm and unshaken," and add­
ed that the "end is not yet in sight.**
Criticize United States.
Berlin, via London, Sept. 29.—Im­
mediately on the heels of the utter*
ances of tha imperial chancellor in
the reichstag concerning the. subma­
rine campaign, the afternoon newspa­
pers generally print strong criticisms
of the neutrality of the United States
based on the news of the death of the
American aviator, Rockwell, and the
presence of other American aviators
on the western front.
They connect this evidence of Am*
erican sympathy for the Entente Al­
lies and the supplying-.of war materi­
als by firms in the United States as
an indication of the futility of conces­
sions to the American standpoint
with regard to submarines. They de­
clare that these facts show how Am­
erican respect for neutrality is van­
ishing and how America is using the
present form of submarine warfare to
cover the active participation of Am­
erican concerns in the war on tbe
side of the Entente Allies.
CLAY COUNTY OFFICIALS GET

Moorhead, Minn., Sept. 29.—Sixty*
five cases of beer, twenty-one casks
of the same fluid, and one cask of
whiskey, were obtained by Clay coun­
ty authorities in a raid on the North*
em Pacific freight and express depot
here yesterday afternoon.
The railroad company is chsrged In
