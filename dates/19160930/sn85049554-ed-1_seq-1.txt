&•" The Roumanian Invasion of Tran
sylvania has met with a setback In
the Hermanstadt region, some
twenty miles north of the Rouma
nian border, according: to Berlin. A
victory over the strong Roumanian
'forces by troops under General von
Falkenhagrne is announced.
General von Falkhaynfl Is one of
the most-noted of German military
commanders and was chief of the
general staff until recently, when
ho was displaced by Field Marshal
von Hlndenberg. Today's mention
of his name in an official statement
was the finft Intimation that he was
in active service in the field.
The fact that a general of such note
has been given command in Tran
sylvania apparently meana that an
important campaign in this terri
tory launder way. A\new Teutonic
offensive successfully pressed there
would place Roumania betwee^ two
fires, as a large German force is in
Dubrudja, under another of Ger

shal van Mackensen.

»*»*-•.
the conversations he had with Herr
von Holleben, the German ambassador,
and tne abrupt change tl policy by the
German imperial government when It
learned of the orders to Admiral
Dewey's fleet.
This abrupt charge is attributed, in
a letter of one A. W. Callisen, which
Colonel Roosevelt quotes to the ad
vice of Dr. Karl Buens. then German
consul general in New York, who told
the ambassador "that Colonel Roose
velt was not bluffing and that he could
count on his doing as he ihreatened
and that in a conversation, Roosevelt
had shown that he had an intimate
knowledge of the strength and condi
tion of the Goman fleet, which was
no match for ours."
The letter which Colonel Roosevelt
quotes then continues to state that
"Holleben was oblige*^ to eat his own
words and te)egraph in hot haste to
Berlin, vhere his mcsaagG fell like a
bombshell," and the letter attributes
Holleben's recall and dismissal from
the diplomatic service to this circum
stance.
Dr. Buenz when he was shown the
statement of Colonel Roosevelt today
did not recollect the conversations at
tributes ti h'm, altho he did not deny
that thev might Isave taken place.
"It Is true that I war introduced to
Mr. Roosevelt by Mr. Calllson and that
I visited him subsequently at Saga
more Hill,^ he said, "but I do not re
member discussing the German or
American navies with him. Mr. "Roose
velt himself states with regard to me
that he had no idea that he had any
knowledge whatever of this phase of
the Venezuela affair«until after Mr.
Thayer's book appeared.
"However, I do not mean to deny
any of the assertions of Mr. Roosevelt
or Mr. Callisen, as my familiarity with
the Venezuela matter came later when
I represented the German government
at the negotiations before The Hague
tribunal and earlier conversations
may have slipped my mind."

Battle Creek, Mich., Sept 30.—Thou
sands of people of Battle Creek and
surrounding sections of Michigan
massed along gaily decorated streets
and gave Theodore Roosevelt a noisy
greeting here late today. This was to
be Colonel Roosevelt's first campaign
speech in Michigan for Charles E.
Hughes and the second he has made
thus far on behalf of the republican
presidential candidate.
Colonel Roosevelt reviewed a long
parade and held a public reception.
Then while he was taking two hours'
rest a great crowd flooked to a circus
tent where the speech was delivered.
He began his speech shortly after 4
o'clock. He said in part:
"I never uttered one word of criti
cism of President Wilson until a year
and a half afteir he was elected presi
dent. If he had stood by the honor
and the interest of the American peo
ple, I would have thrown up my hat for
him, and would have supported him
heart and soul. I not merely kept sil
ent during the first eighteen months or
two.years. I tried actively to sup
port him. The only errors I tfave made
in connection with Mr. Wilson were
due to incautiously accepting his state
ments and supporting his policies in
the effort to 'stand by the president.'
It was with deep reluctance that I was
forced to the conclusion that the ef
fort to stand by him was incompatible
with standing by the lntererts of man
kind, and the honor of this "nation. But
in my view there was no alternative
for any honorable man, when once I
became convinced,'-as I am convinced,
that the conscience of this people has
been seared, and .Its moral sense dulled
by the leadership of the administra
tion and of congress during the last
three years. These false servants of
the people have taught us to enjoy
soft ease and swollen wealth In the
present without taking one effective
step, to ward off .rulnpuf: disaster
the future. These false servanta-of the'
people have betrayed the soul of. the
nation.
"The supporters of Mr. Wilson say
that the American people should vote
for him because he has kej|(t us out of
war.' It is worth wtyle to -remember
that this a claim that can not be ad
vanced either on behalf of "Washington
or of Lincoln. Neither Washington
nor Lincoln kept us out of war. Amer
icans, and the people of the world at
large, now reverence the memories of
these two men, because, and only be
cause, they put righteousness before
peace. They abhorred war. They
shunned unjust or wanton or reckless
war. But they possessed that stern
valor of patriotism which bade them
put duty first not safety first which
bade them accept war rather than an
unrighteous and disastrous peace.
There were peace-at-any-price nieta in
the days of Washington. They were the
torles. There were peace-at-any-price
men in the days of Lincoln. They were
the 5*pperheads. The men who now
with timid hearts and quavering voices
praise Mr. Wilson for having kept us
out of war, are the spiritual heirs of
the tories of 1776, and the copperheads
of 1864. The men who followed Wash
ington at Trenton and Yorktown, and
who suffered with him thru the wln
\ter at Valley Forge and the men who
wore the blue under Grant and the
gray under Lee were men of-valor,
who sacrificed^ everything to serve the
right as It was given them to see the
right. They spurned with contemptu
ous indignation the counsels of the
feeble and cowardly folk who In their
day spoke for peace-at-any-prlce.
Policy of Tame Submiaaion.
"President Wilson by his policy of
tame submission to insult and injury
from all whom he feared has Invited
the murder of our men, women, and
children by Mexican bandits on land,
and by German submarines on the sea.
He has spoken much ofv the 'New
Freedom. In International practice
this has meant freedom for the repre
sentatives of any foreign power to
murder American men, and outrage
American women unchecked by the
president President Wilson has count
ed upon his belief that the American
people are indifferent to their duties,
because they are too much absorbed In
profits, too much pleased with the un
healthy prosperity which flourishes
because others are suffering too
greedily content with a momentary
immunity from danger, due to the fact
that all possible foes are otherwise en
gaged. He has believed that our^ peo
ple will not look ahead. He has lia-'
lioivfirt that they will remain blind to
the fact that disaster will surety in the
end overtake them if they shirk thelt'
duties in the present. He believes that
If they are allowed -to enjoy good pro
fits and high wages, and go to the
movies, and purchase automobiles,
they will pay no thought to, the possi
bility of future ruin, and no thought
to Ithe sufferings of their fellow-coun
trymen and countrywomen who, at the
present moment suffer the last ex
tremities of torture and outrage.

"The other day, discussing- his Mr

fuse to extend the hand of welcome
to any one who obtains power In a
sister republic by treachery and vio
lence.' Fine words only, as usual,
they are contradicted by iMr. Wilson's
deeds. Let this statement about Huerta
be tested by iMr. Wilson's record in
exactly, similar cases when dealing
wtlh other men. In February, 1914, at
the very time he was refusing to rec
ognise Huerta In iMexico, President
Wilson recognised: Colonel Benavldes
in Peru altho Bettsvldes had obtained
his power by the^akact means which
Mr. Wilson denoiideed in the case ot
Huerta. The government of Benavldes
was founded on assassination, and had
no vestige of constitutional authority
back of It. It cameinto power In Feb
ruary, 1914, wb,oi Colonel Benavldes
led the garrlson iBBops against the
president's pa^acep Imprisoned the
president and assalislnated the min
ister of war, jtnd various "Others. Min
ister McMillan reported these facts
fully to the president. The case against
Benavldes was far. more flagrant
f.hain
that against Huerta but President
Wilson boldly 'extended the hand of
welcome to the man who obtained
power in a sister republic by treach
ery and violence, and whose title was
based upon assassination and Intrigue.*
It Is absolutely impossible to accept
Mr. Wilson's statement as a justifi
cation in the case of Huerta, unless
we admit that that very statement ir
retrievably condemns him In the case
of Benavldes. The only other explan
ation Is that Mr. Wilson's statement
in the Huerta matter was not Intended
to correspond with the facts, but mere
ly to impress well-meaning persons
who were Ignorant of the facts.
"In both San Domingo and Haiti
President Wilsofi intervened by force
on behalf of men who had obtained
power precisely as Mr. Huerta ob
tained it Indeed, ht the case of Haiti,
President Zamor -was guilty of far
•worse conduct. Birt San Domingo and
Haiti were weak and President Wilson
was willing to act as regards them as
"he did not venture to act In Mexico.
Applies Acid Teat.
"But it is -Mr. WlIson's recognition of
Carranza which nfirre than anything
©lse applies the 'acid test,' of which
Mr. Wilson is sofond of speaking, to
Mr. Wilson's own aillegations as to why
he did not recognize Huerta. Every
argument against Huerta applied with
tenfold more truth and weight against
Carranza. Immediately after Mr. Wil
son recognized Carranza, the latter
courtmartlaled and shot a former
member of Huerta's cabinet, Garcia
Grandos, who had committed no crime
whatever except having served in
Huerta's cabinet. It was a deliberate
murder of a man of good character
who was at the time in private life
and Carranza ha^ already permitted
tils followers to assassinate members
of the house and members of the
senate of the Mexican congress. For
full particulana refer you to the
speech of Senator Fill on June 2, last.
•On April 3, WIS, the Americans resi
dent in the City of Mexico sent to the
•department 6f state a letter setting
•forth that:
Carranza's tro^gs had with-
'aut chedutby him, and acting by his
orders, kiSed men, outraged "W9«nen

solders in September, 1&16, invaded
American territory at several different
-points, and engaged in burning and
looting American property and killing
'American citizens and, says Mr. Wil
son thru his secretary of state, "not
only were these murders characterized
toy ruthless brutality, but uncivilized
acts of mutilation were perpetrated."
One of these "uncivilized" acts was
committed on Sept. 29, when some of
Carranaa's soldiers captured an Ameri
can trooper, killed :him and cut off his
bead and ears. Exactly twenty days
later, on Oct. 19, Mr. Wilson expressed
"pleasure" in informing Carranza that
ho recognized him! Since the recog
nition Carranza's troops by his orders
have treacherously attacked and
murdered American soldiers on at
•least tiwo occasions. If the acts above
recited—which are merely samples/ of
'the course of conduct Carranza has al
ready pursued—do not constitute "In
trigue and assaslnatlon, treachery
and violence," then the words have
lost their meaning. Mr. Wilson took
pleasure" in extending the hand of
•welcome" to Carranza, whose own
hand Is red with the blood of murdered
•men and wo«ien of his own nation, and
whose hands, unlike the hands of
fauerta, were also red with the blood
of murdered Americans, of murdered
American civilians, and of murdered
'American soldiers wearing the Ameri
can uniform. But President Wilson
cared as little for the deaths of these
men as he cared for the honor of the
uniform. He with "pleasure" "ex
pended the hand of welcome" to the
man guilty of their murder."
