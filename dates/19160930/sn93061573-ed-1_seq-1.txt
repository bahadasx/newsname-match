by the llrst speaking tours of the

The l'ecos Valley was iuvadeil by
Governor Mel otiald. Lieutenant
Governor, K. C. do liara, Democratic
candidate for governor, and former
Governor M. A. Otero, Democratic
candidate for slate auditor, and
their trip was a series of ovations.
In his speech at Itoswell, Lieutenant
Governor tie Haca, the able, honest,
upstanding, fearless American that
the people of New Mexico are going
to place in the executive office, made
a tremendous bit. Among other
things be said: "Enemies of mine
say I Bin too partisan to be a fair
governor. In my home county of
w Miguel, to be a democrat is to
i martyr. I have always fought

by Frank W. Clancy, then district

In his speeches in the Pecos val
ley, Governor McDonald, drove
home the fact that the Republican
. candidates cannot get away from
the records .they have made; that
they must stand on them in this
campaign.

of the Democratis candidates A. A.
Jones, Antonio Lucero, W. B. Wal
ton, II. L. Hall, Felix Garcia, Harry
L. Patton, George A. Davisson, and
J. L. G. Swinny were together for
much of the time, and the recep
tions tendered them were splendid.
New Democratic history will bo
made this year in Taos and Rio'Ar-
up for A. A. Jones and the rest of the i
Democratic- candidates.
The northern trip ended at Gallup
where Jones. Walton and Lucero
spoke before the greatest political
meeting in the history of Mckinley
county. The Democrats of Mckin
ley are Hiis year conlident. of plac
ing the county in the Democratic
column and purging it of political
I'olteliliess by electing a Democrat
ic county ticket.

Hubbell has evidenced bis IUiicm
for the dignified position of United

Democratic candidates; by mud
slinging of the rankest sort: by re
ferring to Governor McDonald, as
a "devil wiBh horn." Even the
nerve of the Republican press bu
reau hasn't been equal to putting
out anything that Hubbell has said.
The Republican gang of New Mex
ico is without an issue in this cam
paign. It-has nothing to fight with
but misrepresentation and political
slander, falsehood and intimidation.
Its euttle-nsh press bureau is des
perately endeavoring to muddy the
waters, but the people of Xew Mex
ico ure not to be deceived. They
have been hoodwinked for the last
time. They are determined this
year to repudiate, decisively and fin
ally, the Republican gangsters who
áre seeking power solely with the
object of exploiting the state for
neifish and unscrupulous ends.

SCHOOL NOTES
The school liuilding is not open
to school children until 8:30. It
would be very much better if par
ents would not permit their child
ren to come to school until that
time.
A sturdy period lias been establish
ed in all departments of the school
from 8:30 until 9:00. This period is
not compulsory on the part of the
pupil, but all teachers are requir
ed to be in their rooms to take char
ge of the work and give individual
assistance to pupils who need it.
This is one of the mos helpful per
iods of the day and pupils who need
help should improve the opportun
ity. The class in typewriting is pro
gressing nicely. Besides the pupils
of the High School a number of the
teachers have entered the class,
'ihree Standard typewriters have
been procured and every available
period is being utilized during the
regular school session as well as the
periods after school.
Another course which is being re
ceived enthusiastically is the vocal
music. Every department in the
school, both High school and Com
mon is receiving systematic instruc
tion in the subject. Quartettes and
Glee clubs are being organized in
'the High School and a pleasant and
During the past week, Pennington
and Talbot, the enterprising real
estate men. purchased the famous
Palo Ulanco sheep ranch near Glad
stone. The purchase amounts to
1100 acres of deeded laud, and 1800
acres of lease from the state. There
is no finer land in New Mexico. The
tract is now on the market in par- (
eels or lots to suit purchaser.
BOB, AND (?)
David Kellen of Shattuck, Okla
homa, an old time friend of The
Xews man and now democratic nom
inee for county treasurer of Ellis
county, spent, several days in Clay
ton this week. About a year ago
Mr. Kellen purchased a section of
land from the State of New Mexico,
under the regime of Ervien, and
now the same Ervien has notified
him that there is nothing doing and
has returned his money. It seems
that one of Bob's friends found out
that he wanted the land, and thus
a bona fide settler must get out of
the way. . Under the present admin
istration of stale lands, everything
seems to be reserved for Bob and
his friends.
WLKOFF GARAGE ABOUT DONE
The Wikoff Garage on Third Street
is being rushed to completion as
rapidly as possible. The workmen
are putting the rafters in place this
week. When , completed this will
be one of the finest garages in the
state, as it has all the modern con
veniences , '

ra Massey of near Stead, was a
business visitor and trader in the
city. Wednesday and Thursday. It
doesn't take Ira long to give his
reason for being a Wilson man. The
llrst of the week he sold his broom
corn crop for $170. a ton, and as he
puts it; "If Wilson hadn't put a stop
to the railroad strike I couldn't have
sold it'for a d a."
G. V. Cole, formerly of Sedan, but
now of Staunton, met with a very
serious accident last Sunday. Mr.

and threw Mr. Cole to the ground,
lacerating his thigh very seriously,
also causing an ugly scalp wound.
Dr. Steel of Folsom, was called and
dressed the wounds, and reports Mr.
Cole resting as easy as eould be expected.
