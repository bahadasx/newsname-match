AS1I1NUTON. 1" tlw city
nf Washington, fndng the
Mall und situated next to
the Continental hall of the
Daughters of tho Ameri
can Revolution, Is what
iimiiy Judges of tho lino In
architecture have declared to lie the
most beautiful building in the capital
of the United States. It Is the homo
of tbe Pnn-Ainerlcnn union, of which
John Barrett Is the director general.
In this building every little while
there Is a meeting which has no coun
terpart In any other country of the
world. In n beautiful hull nnd about
1 magnificent table made of South
American woods gather the nmlmssa
hirs nnd ministers ot all the American
republics. Tho secretary of state of
the United Status nf America presides
at the meeting.
In foreign countries n few diplo
mas sometimes meet to discuss mut
ters ot grave moment to their cotin
'.rlos. There Is no general meeting
'inch ns that which takes plnce In the
ll ty of Washington. Only on the rarest
occasions In the European capitals do
the representatives ot all tho coun
ries gather for a conclave. The
Ihrent -of war generally brings the
foreign representatives together in
most ot the capitals or the world.
In tho city of Washington, In the
Pnn-Amerlcnn union building, the
ambassadors and ministers of the
South American countries meet tn con
fer with one nnnther and with the
secretary of state of the United States
on subjects nf peace and amity nnd
In the endeavor tn make stronger tho
bonds of union which hold together
all the republics of the West.
The Pan-American union wis or
ganized 20 years ago. In that year
there wns a Pan-American conference
following a former conference which
wns held In Washington In the winter
nf tho year previous. James G. Blnlne,
then secretary of state, presided nt
the first conference. To Blaine per
haps more thnn to nny other American
Is due the credit for tho Inception of
the Idea of nn organlzntlmi which
would bind closely together the west
ern republics. For a long time the
organization was known ns the "Bu
reau of American Republics."
In writing about Pun-Americanism
nnd the Pnn-Amerlcnn union, John
Barrett, tho present director, said:
"Beginning on n small scale, it has
now grown Into n position of power
nnd usefulness where It can bo de
scribed as the most comprehensive
nnd practical International Institution
nt least It has been so described by
eminent statesmen not only In the
Unlt"d States, but In Europe. As evi
dence nf the way It Is regarded In Eu
rope, It can be cited that recently one
of the most prominent English states
men remarked that, 'If there had been
a Pun-European union, fashioned upon
the Pan-Amerlcnn union nt Wnshlng
tlon, with Its hendquarters 'n London,
or Purls, or Berlin, or Vienna, there
never would have been a European
war.' "
The present homo of the Pan-Amerl-enn
union was built In the years lPDS
0!). The corner stone wns laid In tho
spring of 10OS In tho presence of 5,000
persons, nmong whom were the mem
bers of the Supreme court, the cabinet,
the house and senate, tho diplomatic
corps nnd President Roosevelt, Sec
retary of Stnte Root, Bishop Cran
ston of the Methodist church, Cardinal
Gibbons of the Roman Catholic church
nnd Andrew Carnegie, the lntter of
whom mnde tho Paii-Aiuerlcan union
building possible by the ?lft of n large
sum of money.
Ono gets from what Ellhu Root said
on the occasion of tho lnylng of the
corner stone an Idea of tho seopo of
the work nt the Institution and of tho
spirit which keeps It alive.
Mr. Root said: "This building is to
bo In Its most manifest utilitarian serv
ice, n convenient Instrument for asso
ciation nnd growth of mutual knowl
edge among the peoplo of the different
republics. The library maintained
here, the books nnd journals acces
sible here, the useful and Interesting
publications of tho bureau, the enor
mous correspondence carried on with
seekers for knowledge about Ameri
can countries, tho opportunities now

"Has your hou selected any special

"Suro ho hns, Ho's got u good Job

How all the American Republics twenty odd
have worked together for the promotion of peace
and prosperity among themselves is told here
by Edward B. Clark 3urh an organization
in Europe might hv - ented the war
afl'iirdeil for further growth in all
those activities. Justify the pains and
the expense.
"Thu building, however, Is more Im
portant as the symbol, tho ever-present
reminder, the perpetual nssertlon
of unity of common Interest nnd pur
Ioso nnd hope among all the republics.
This building is a confession of faith,
a covenant of fraternal duty, n decla
ration of allegiance to an Ideal. Tho
members of The Hague conference de
scribed that conference In the pre
amble of lis great arbitration conven
tion ns:
, " 'Animated by the slncero desire to
work for tho maintenance of general
peace.
" 'Resolved to promote by nil the
efTdrts1 In their power tho friendly set
tlement of International disputes.
"'Recognizing the solidarity uniting
fhe members of tho society of civilized
nations.
" 'Desirous nf extending tho empire
