STATE BOARD
OF AFFAIRS WILL
PUSH AMENDMENT.
»
til
in
ill
That the proponents of the
amendment creating the State
Hoard of Aflairs will make a vig
emus effoit to demonstrate (lie
absolute necessity for a measure
oi i ins kind, is taken for granted
since some signs of opposition
have appeared. There eeems to
be a complete iniHundeieianding
of (lie purpose id the amendment,
according to those who believe' in
it, and who assert, without reser
vaMon, that the tiriHDGial salva
tion of tins state is dependent
upon the successful outcome of
the proposition. They make the
statement that the state of Louisi
ami must increase its revenues or
public necessities will be cut off
and a robotic condition précipitai,
ed which would impair the credit
of the hi ate for years to come
It is pointed out that the big
northern banking concerns which
are now in Louisiana snapping up
goqd loads bond issues in various
wards and paiiehes, would give
tlie state a wide birth just at the
time w hen good roads sentiment
is in a lising wave of popularity
foicastlng di finite prosperity foi
i lie country parishes.
Whatever changes made in as
sesMiienfs miner the amendment,
will lie made gradually they as
sert. The Board would have to
feel its way and particularly
avoid drastic action. Their aim
is to equalize bh nearly as posai
file so that the necessary burden
of taxation will be equally and
even distributed".
