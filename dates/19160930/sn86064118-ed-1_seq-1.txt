GENERAL WAVE OF DISSATISFACTION GROWS AMONG
COLORED P OPLE OF STATE AGAINST
SEPARATE SCHOOL LAW.
There is an apparent wave of dissatisfaction sprcadong among
Many Hardships Worked on Colored Schols Because of the Law.
the colored people of Oklahoma because of the separate school law
of this state and in all probability a fight against this law will be
waged in the near future. '1 he colored schois of the state, as a rule,
are below the standard and according to the opinion of those familiar
with the Oklahoma school laws, coiorcd people in the larger cities
arc taxed for the support of schols from which their children receive
no benefit because the law puts all coiorcd schols in charge of the
County Commisioncrs and the County Superintendent, the salaries of
the teachers and the maintenance of the schools for colored children
coming from this source. Often in the cities bonds are voted for
schol improvement and the colored people are taxed foi such im
provement when in fact the yderive no benefit therefrom. In many
places in the state the term of the coiorcd schols are cut short some
times as much as six mouths and the County Commissioners give as
their reason that there is not enough funds for the coiorcd schools.
But in these counties the white schools alway.s run the full nine
months. Recently in Mcintosh cohnty at Hufaula, the colored
schols were ordered to run two months and close, but the nolored
people here appealed to the County Judge and he ordered the Com
missioners to allow the soliool to run at least three month'. The
white srhols in Mcintosh will all run the full nine mouths.
These conditions have become unbearable to the colored patrons
and they arc planning to start a vigorous fight against it- Efforts
will.be made to have the law repealed at the next session of the legis
lature and another law cnaccd which will guarantee cqulity in the
school facilities and accommodations.
