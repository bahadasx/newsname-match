ST. MICHAEL'S
TPastor and People Have Jubilee
Celebration All This
Week.
Opened With Imposing: Parade
and Religious Services Sun
day Morning:.
Catholic Knights Present Father
O'Connor n Purse of
Gold.
iLL SERVICES WELL ATTENDED
Of deep interest to the Catholics
of this city and diocese this week
was the golden jubilee celebration
of St. Michael's church on Brook
street, of which the Rev. Martin
O'Connor is the faithful and zeal
ous pastor. The celebration began
Sunday morning when the Uni
formed Knights of St. John and
'Catholic Knights of America, the
Ancient Order of Hibernians,
Knights of Columbus, Catholic
Knights and the parish societies
assembled In the streets adjoining
tho church. The procession formed
on Brook street, headed by Lieut.
.Maloney and a platoon of mounted
police, and a beautiful sight was
presented as it wended its down
Market, out Fifth past the Cathe
dral, up Walnut to Third, thence
in to Jefferson and back to the
church. First came the eight uni
formed bodies of the Knights of
St. John, then a beautiful float of
SL Michael's church bearing the
pastor and altar boys and little
girls In white, who were followed
by the Hibernians, Catholic Knights
of America, Knights of Columbus,
and the ladles of the sodalities in
automobiles, the whole extending
from the church on Brook street
to Fifth and Market.
Upon the return to the church
the Right Rev. Bishop O'Donaghuo
with many priests and altar boys
moved slowly to tho altar, the sweet
notes of the organ lending a charm
to the already magnificent sight as
Father Martin O'Connor began the
jubilee mass, assisted by the Rev.
Ueorge M. Connor, pastor of St.
William's church, as deacon and
the Rev. Francis O'Connor, of the
Catliedrar""of'"itnV" Asusmptlbn. as
subdeacon. Mozart's Twelfth Mass,
which was sung when the church
was dedicated half a century ago,
-was sung by a choir of thirty voices,
accompanied by an orchestra.
After the mass tho Catholic
"Knights of America assembled and
presented Father O'Connor with a
purse of gold, Col. Joseph P. Mc
Ginn making the presentation on
Ijehalf of St. Michael's branch.
Sunday night tho services con
sisted of solemn vespers, with the
Itev. Father John Fitzgerald, of St.
Lco'b, as celebrant, and the Rev.
Michael F. Melody, chaplain of St.
"Vincent's Orphan Asylum, as sub
beacon. The Rev. Louis Deppen,
editor of the Record, preached tho
sermon and reviewed the history of
the parish. Father Deppen at
tended the dedication of St.
.Michael's in 1866 and his sister
sang in the choir.
Solemn high masses were cele
brated each morning, when tho
members of the parish showed their
deep devotion and loyalty by .being
present in large numbers. Judge
Matt O'Doherty was the principal
Bpeaker Monday night, when "Irish
night" was observed as part of the
jubilee celebration. Mayor Busche
meyer was also one of tho speakers,
and was presented by Attorney Leo
Sandmann. Judge O'Doherty de
clared that the ambition and prayer
of all true Catholics Is that that
provision of the Constitution guar
anteeing perfect liberty of religious
expression shall over remain the
true cornerstone of the American
Government. Ho also spoke of tho
work of the Catholic church.
Because of the many nationalities
represented by the church member
ship, special nights for the different
groups were observed. Tuesday
night was German night, with for
jner Lieut. Gov. Edward J. McDer
mott as speaker, while Thomas
"Walsh was speaker Wednesday,
Syrian night, and Patrick Savage
--spoko Thursday night, Italian
night. The closing service will be
held Friday night with the Rev.
'Father Martin O'Connor, pastor of
tho church, making the address.
'Tho jubilee celebration proved that
the peopla of St. Michael's have
little to learn from the larger and
richer congregations.
RELATIVES SUMMONED.
John Fein, Jpseph Fein, Deputy
Becorder Henry Fein and Miss
Jennie Fein, of New Albany, left
Sunday for Greensburg, Ind., where
they were called on account of the
illness of the Rev. amer josepn
Fein, pastor of St. Mary's church at
that place. Father Fein is a native
of New Albany, where he spent his
ooyhood. The last report was that
his condition had changed for the
Tjetter,
EMIGRATION DECREAING.
Irish emigration continues to de
crease. For the first seven months
of this year the figures were 23
-per cent, below' those of last year.
Last year they were 50 per cent,
"below those of 1914. The decrease
'is altogether In men, the emigration
of women showing an increase. As
always, the emigration from Ulster
is greater than that from any other
' prpvince. Emigration from all Ire-
land to the United States of Amer
ica has during the past seven
months fallen to 1,630 from 3,067
during tho corresponding part of
Ifist year. Tho passages prepaid In
America, which In former years ex
ceeded 2,000, numbered this year
only 198.
MISSION A SUCCESS.
The men's mission closed at St.
Louis Bertrand's church last Sun
day evening, the final sermon be-1
ing preucueu uy uuv. r uuier jjieary,
and Papal benediction given by Rev.
Father Flnnerty. The mission was
a sucess In every way, the attend
ance at both morning and evening
exercises being good, while about
600 men received holy communion
in a body at the 7:30 o'clock mass
Sunday, while many others received
at the earlier masses. Many appli
cations were received for member
ship In the Holy Namo Society.
MONTH OF THE ROSAUY.
October is the .month of the Holy
Rosary. It is also dedicated to the
Holy Angels. The principal feasts
of the month are: October 2, first
Friday and the feast of tho Holy
Guardian Angel; October 4, feast of
the Holy Rosary; October 18, St.
Luke, EvangelUt; October 24, St.
Raphael Archangel; October 28, SS.
Slmlon and Jude, apostles. The
feast of tho Holy Rosary Is cele
brated on the first Sunday In Oc
tober. On October 7, 1571, the
Christians under Don John of Aus
tria obtained a glorious victory over
the Turks at Lepanto. This event
occurred on the same day that the
Confraternity of the Rosary was
holding a solemn procession in
Rome and offering special devotions
to obtain a victory over tho Infidel.
In gratitude for this extraordinary
victory, which was attributed to
Mary's intercession, Pope Pius V.
Instituted this feast, which after re
peated victories over tho Turks in
the beginning of the last century,
1716, was permanently established
on the first Sunday In October.
The recitation of the rosary is
for the latty what the breviary is
for tho clergy. As tho breviary Is
composed of the 150 psalms of
David, so the rosary contains 150
Hail Marys. Therefore the entire
rosary Is often called the Psalter
of Mary. We never tire of repeat
ing words that come from the
depths of tho heart. Our Lord in
his agony did this in the Garden
of Gethsemane on Mount Olivet.
David In his psalm cxxx.v. exclaims
no less than twenty-seven times:
"His mercy endureth forever;" and
St. Francis of Asslsl spent whole
nights repeating tho words "My God
and my all." The devout sen-ants
of Maiy used to address her fre
quently In the words of tho Arch
angel, adding one Hall Mary after
another 'asone'places a -rose- In -a
wreath.
The hermits of the first century
who could not read the psalter were
wont to recite one Our Father and
one Hall Mary Instead oW every
psalm, and In order to note the
number they have said made use
of small pebbles or a row of little
balls strung on a cord. The Hall
Mary presents to us the Incarnation
of Christ, whence all tho mysteries
of our redemption proceed.
The rosary Is divided Into fifteen
decades, the mysteries being ar
ranged In three sets of five each cor
responding to the three great divis
ions of our Lord's life, his Infancy
and youth, his passion and death,
and his resurrection and glory.

ENGLAND PROFITS.
That England, In spite of her
professions to the contrary, has
profited by the opening of our malls
is apparent from tho enormous in
crease In her exports for the last
two months. During these months
England's exports have been the
largest she has ever had for a like
period, and this, too, in spite of tho
tact that the factories are short
handed. That England Is able to
get new trade markets for her goods
at this time is suspicious, and that
Bho intends to extend her com
mercial conquests to the exclusion
of other nations Is evident from the
"blacklist," and the new regulations
for trade between neutral countries.
Our own Government must see this,
and consequently the complaisance
with which she permits England to
tamper with the mails and with her
trade Is a puzzle too profoundly
deep for the man In the street.
BUT FOR THE AVAR.
This year is the seventh centenary
of the Third Order of St. Dominic.
But for the war all the tertlarlee
of St. Dominic in the world would
be represented at the tomb of St.
Dominic in Bologna, Italy.

CONDITIONS
Father Dennis O'Connor Saw
During Eight Weeks in
Ireland.
Treatment Meted Out to Amer
icans by English Military
Aristocrats.
Everything Being Dono to Ter
rify and Overawe tho
People.
THE SINN FEIN. MOVEMENT
"I would never visit Ireland again
during the war," said Father Den
nis O'Connor when seen In the
priory of the Twenty-eighth street
Carmelite church. Father O'Connor,
who was formerly stationed at
Tarrytown, N.Y., has just returned
on the St. Paul from an eight
weeks' visit to Ireland, having been
promoted during his absence to
East Twenty-eighth street.
"You see," he went on, "I am an
American and tho treatment meted
out by the military autocrats to
Americans In Ireland Is not exactly
In the nature of a hospitable wel
come. We are shadowed and wor
ried everywhere we go, and have
to notify the authorities personally
whenever we leave or return to a
village."
"Why is that," I asked. "I was
unable to understand it at first,"
he said, "but tho recent order pro
hibiting from landing in Ireland not
only Americans, but British sub
jects who have lived In America,
throws some light on the question.
Things have been done and still
continue to be done over there
which it would never do to have
judged by Americans or even by
anyone who had lived long enough
in the States to become Imbued with
American notions of justice and fair
play. They must bo preparing for
further orgies," he added, "because
they are now going to deport all
Americans who have landed in the
country since the first of March."
"But usually," I said, "is it not
a fact that things are made spe
cially easy for clergymen when
traveling aoroad?" "They made
me leave my thumb prints like a
common criminal at Liverpool," was
the reply. v . , -
' Father O'Connor then described
what he had seen. Ho said the
military had power of life and death
and were everywhere in control.
Every Important center, every rail
way junction, In fact every strategic
point, was guarded by a camp of
soldiers. Every cross-road was
watched and every passing vehicle
subjected to the scrutiny of the po
lice. Everything was being i done
to terrify and overawe the people.
Military air ships were constantly
over Dublin and Wexford.
"Had the Sinn Fein movement
many followers in Wexiord?"
"It had followers everywhere," he
said, "and now such is the bitter
ness and anger at the Dublin
atrocities that the few who may be
still anti-Sinn Fein dare not give
expression to their views. The re
publican manifesto and the ruins
of Dublin have stirred the people's
minds and aroused a burning sense
of national self-consciousness and
national pride."
"What do you mean," I asked,
"by tho Dublin atrocities? Do you
refer to the execution of the lead
ers?" "The execution, needless to say,
did arouse horror not only In Ire
land but the world over, but when
I spoke of the Dublin atrocities I
did not refer primarily to them. I
have visited Dublin and seen the
ruins and made my inquiries of
people who saw the fighting. When
tho insurrection first broke out
there was a feeling of anxiety
among certain sections of the
population, who waited eagerly for
the military to come In overwhelm
ing force and protect them from
these 'desperate men.' When tho
military did come the looting and
butchery and drunken brawling be
gan. They broke into people's
houses and stole sliver and jewelry.
In North King street tho most awful
crimes were committed. In one
house there were four men with
their wives and children. They had
no connection whatever with the
rebels and when the women and
children were ordered out the sol
diers promised that the men would
be detained but not harmed. One
of the women with great difficulty
returned to her home a few hours
later, the military being still in
occupation. Her husband was dead
on the floor with his three com
panions. They were subsequently
found burled la tho yard at the
back, their watches, money and
rings having all been looted from
their dead bodies. Another woman
described how the military had
burst into her house. Her husband
and little twelve-year-old boy were
upstairs. Tho soldiers ran up and
as she listened below she heard the
voice of her. little son, 'Oh! don't
do that, sir!' When sho went up
later father and son were dead, the
blood still running from the bayonet
stabs in their bodies. These are
one or two Instances. Affidavits of
these and similar occurrences were
taken, and the Lord Mayor of Dub
lin presented a petition signed by
many prominent men for an Inquiry
at the bar of the House vie com
mons, but that and many similar
petitions were refused. There is
nothing but admiration for the
clean, honest fight which tho rebels
put up. When they took possession
of a house the first thing the rebel
officer did was to lock all the doors
,??
the street and to turn or tKeSkey

ineir own iooa ana wounu. not. toucn
any eatables that they rcould have"
had for tho asking." h ",
Father O'Connor thenlwent on to
say that tho cost of llvlag was very
high, but that tho crow were ex
ceptionally good. Thoro was a
movement though to imake the
farmers sell hay and wool having
already been commandeVed by the
Government. He saldf that the
press censorship was rigldand that
since the rebellion no Squptatlons
from American papers (have been
printed. ;

NOTRE DAME.
For tho second time within a
week fire raged through Chemistry
Hall at Notre Dame University on
Wednesday evening of last week
and totally destroyed the structure,
entailing a loss of $70,000. Three
firemen and twelve students were
slightly Injured by falling brick.
It is believed that tho blaze was
due to particles of phosphorus
which had become moistened at the
first flro and which had spread
under the floors and behind the
walls. These bits of phosphorus
became dry In a few days and
Ignited. Plans will be made for the
construction of a now and larger
Chemistry Hall and work will
probably begin at once, as the build
ing is needed for laboratory pur
poses. ,
TO PRAY FOR DEAD.
The Special Commission revising
the prayer book of the Episcopal
church will at Its triennial conven
tion to be held In St. Louis, Octq
ber 11, recommend prayers for tho
dead as part of the ritual of the
Episcopal church. This has been
brought about by the war", the
Archbishop of Canterbury being one
of those In favor of tho movement,
and It will be remembered requiem
services for Lord Kitchener were
held in St. Paul's Cathedral, Lon
don. The request for prayers are
to be read aloud, as in the Catholic
church, and the names mentioned
for whom the prayers are Intended.
It has been prophesied that this
move wil forever debar the Episco
pal church from a union with other
Protestant churches and will bring
closer relations with tho Catholic
church.
COFFEE SOCIAL.
The Ladles'- Sewing Society of St.

Hibernian Convention at Bir
mingham Was a Great
Success.
Delegates and Visitors Tendered
a Grand Banquet at llillman
.Hotel.
Frank J. Thompson Pays Tri
bute to Irish Faith and
Loyalty.
ARE ALWAYS TRUE TO AMERICA
m
One of tho most pleasing features
of tho Alabama Hibernian State
convention at Birmingham was the
banquet at the Hillman Hotel and
tho address of Frank J. Thompson.
of Mobile. Mrs. Thompson, noting
the shamrock on the programme,
quoted Rev. Father Boland's ex
quisite tribute to Ireland's emblem
and said in part;
It should bo a source of regret
to our friends that the one whoso
place I have been unexpectedly
called upon to fill is not here In
person to make his own speech on
this occasion, for he isjj'ustly noted
as one of the most 'distinguished
Bons of Mobile, the citizens of which
city have felt that In honoring him,
as they have, they were only honor
ing themselves. As I can not hope
to represent Hon. George J. Sullivan
on this occasion, still I can en
deavor to represent myself, and
what I shall say to you will come
from a heart as loyal to tho Hiber
nians as ever beat in the breast of
any of its past or present members.
There are two things that stand
out In bold relief as constituting the
highest glory that attaches to the
name of Hibernian and these are
what the order has done foiv'the
Catholic faith and what It has jstood
for In patriotic devotion to Our
country. It Is to the people of the
little Emerald Isle that the .world
owes more for the perpetuity J and
spread of the Catholic faith than to
any other or .all others combined.
Like the wandering Jew, tho Irish
man Is found In every land and
every clime, and wherever found he
was and is a living, earnest and
unterrifled follower of the Catholic
LfalJth. It Is Jo Ireland and to tho
Irish race therefore more than to
any other land or any other race
that the Catholic faith Is today the
ruling religion among the civilized
nations of the world. Do wo know
what It was, more than all else,
that enabled its adherents to bring
the faith down through the ages,
unchanged and unchangeable? Do
we know what it Is that sustains
its followers today and keeps them
alone among all the multiplied and
multiplying sects that divide and
distract the non-Catholic world In
harmony and united In the faith of
their fathers? It was and Is the cer
tainty of their faith! When Mar
tin Luther cut loose from this
anchorage of certainty he left an
Inheritance that has only borne its
logical results In those divisions
that we see all around us, among
those outside the magic circle that
holds together the followers of our
holy faith.
The seed sowed by St. Patrick In
the minds arid hearts of the Irish
race boro such fruit as clearly pro
claimed its divine origin, and this It
was that enabled that race to trans
mit the same unchanged to their
posterity; and it was the knowledge
of this same great faith that places
the Intelligent Catholic of today so
firmly on the rock of certainty that
even the gates of hell can not shake
him from it. And this faith is so
simple and so comforting that only
a "blind and perverse" generation
will fall to accept and bo guided
by it. The intelligent Catholic
knows with all the certainty of any
established fact that Jesus Christ
was a divine person, and that Ho
came on earth to establish an un
erring guide for man's salvation and
that guide Is the Holy Mother
Church. To deny this Is to deny
Christ's divinity and make the re
ligion He came to establish only a
"cunningly devised fable."
It Is this faith In all Its grandeur
and glory that forms the foundation
of the Order of Hibernians, and the
next great thing for which it stands
and which It teaches with the same
faithfulness that It does our holy
faith Is loyalty to the flag of these
United States. A man who Is as
true to his God as is the Irishman
wherever found can not be false to
his country, whatever that country
may be; no less' can any Hibernian
be a traitor to the American Gov
ernment under which he lives.
I might go on, my friends, and
tell you that many of those whl
signed the Declaration of Inde
pendence were Irish Roman Cath
olics; I might recite for youthe
deeds of our patriotic sons who
fought, bled and died at Bunker
Hill; I might speak of Commodore
Barry, the Father of the American
Navy. In fact I could speak for
hours, and then the story would not
half bo told of tho loyalty and
patriotism of the American, natlvo
sons of Ireland, who have con
tributed so much to tho fame and
glory of the American republic,
whoso safety and welfare is ever
uppermost in the heart of eyefy
Irishman who has ever set foot upon
American soil. Therefore we re
sent with all our heart and with
r11 our soul the insult that has been
hurled at us by a few narrow-minded
bigots that have dared to refer
to us as hyphenated Americans. If
they will but stop and investigate
J the history of our country Amer-
lea from its birth to this good .
hour, they will see that of all tho
people from all tho nations of the
earth who have migrated to these
shores there are none who have as
similated so quickly or who are to
day more in sympathy or who
would more quickly defend with
their life's blood, if need be, the in
stitutions and traditions of our be
loved country than the Irishman.
Truly lias it been said, "Jealousy
l.vea a thlnlng mark."
SPLENDID CIBOIUUM.

Those In charge of the Demo

satisfied with their progress and be
lieve that the eight-hour law which

Republicans has proven a boom

country of the working class have

as they realize the eight-hour law
has been the most Important pleco
of legislation ever enacted from the
Standpoint of the man who tolls
for a living. Many believe that the
eight-hour law will soon apply to all
lines of business and that tho clerks,
salesmen and all classes of work
ers will benefit by this law. Henry
Ford, the automobile manufacturer,
who Is a Republican, says ho will
vote for and support President Wil
son, and in discussing the eight
hour law says: "Tho Republicans
are raising a great howl about tho
eight-hour law and how it will
hamper business. I say and I say
from experience, not from guess
work that the eight-hour law will
help business. Business men and
employes who are hostile to the
eight-hour day do not know their
business. Wo have had the eight
hour day In force In tho Ford fac
tory for three years, and we have
made more money each succeeding
year under It. It has proved Its
own merit."
A local organization of railroad
men are busy furthering President
Wilson's Interests In this section
and this Is certain to have a big
Influence on the result In November.
a3 lt will be remembered that 'four., .
years-ago'TaloadHlmen'thorgh6"uta',
Kentucky supported Roosevelt
nearly to a man, and this Is bound
to havo Its effect now as it did
then. Right here In Louisville thou
sands of raihoad and shop men
voted for Roosevelt and, not to take
any chance of losing their vote, cast
it straight for the Bull Moose ticket,
nearly causing the defeat of Con
gressman Sherley by Fox, who was
and Is practically unknown to the
majority of voters. Despite the at
tempt of the Republican press to
decry tho efforts of the railroad
men and picture them as holdup
men, etc., the fears of the G. O. P.
leaders are not being allayed as to
the effect of the railroaders' cam
paign, railroad men as a rule being
of the hustling type, and their ef
forts In the Presidential campaign
aro bound to have results. The
following compose the local railroad
men's committee: SIgmund A. Leo,
P. H. Murta, W. A. Fisher, Fred
Sessengood, Charles Donohoe, Joe
Rlckerts, J. P. Hagan, P. H. Welsh,
W. P. Zopff, Charles McCaffrey.
Republicans aro tickled over tho
knockout of the county registration
law Thursday in the Court of Ap
peals, It being ruled unconstitu
tional because of a technicality. The
law was fought by tho Louisville
Herald and others Identified with
the pseudo local reformers, who
have always declared themselves in
favor of fair elections, as they real
ize what a benpflt It was to tho
Republicans In the last election
when carloads of negroes were car
ried out into the county to vote re
peatedly, and It Is charged that tho
same methods were used to defeat
Dr. Ryans In the Republican
primary for tho Congressional nom
ination. Speaking of tho Louisville
Herald, politicians and others are
curious to know why tho editor of
that paper forever and persistently
attacks Gov. Stanley not only on
political matters but also on mat
ters entirely foreign to politics, as
for instance the recent Lincoln dedi
cation serving as an excuse to taunt
tho Governor. It Is believed that
Gov. Stanley will turn on his per
sistent tormentor some day, and if
ho does the fur will certainly fly.
Next Tuesday and Wednesday arvs
registration days and Democrats aro
urged to not only register, but act
as a committee of ono in seeing
to it that their neighbors register
in order to vote for President Wil
son, Congressman Sherley and tho
other nominees In November. It lss
expected that many women will
register this time to vote in tho
school election, many of whom aro
outspoken in their determination to
register and vote for Ben Kllng for
the Board of Education, men and
women alike realizing that in voting
for Kllng they are voting to, bring
tho schools back under control of
the people, at least in tho manner
of nominations. There is nothing
to bo said against the two" gentle
men who aro his opponents, but
the opposition is to their selection
as candidates by a chosen few, and
if elected they are responsible to
only that chosen few and not to the
people.
