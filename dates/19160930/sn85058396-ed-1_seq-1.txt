Rumanian In vasion of Transylyania I
II Meets With Severe Reverses) I
ii Noted German Commander
Leading Central Powers in
ii r New Teutonic Offensive
! The Rumanian invasion of Transy
M vania has met with a setback in the
il Hermannstadt region, some 20 miles
I north of tho Rumanian border, ac-
carding to the Berlin headquarters
statement today. A victory over the
. ; K strong Rumanian forces by troops un
,','f der General von Falkenhayn is an-
, nounced.
B , General Falkenhayn is one of the
j.y most noted of German military com
l, manders and was chief of the general
j staff until recently when he was dis-
placed by Field Marshall von Hinden
I"; burg. Mention of his name in the
r i official statement is the first intima-
1 . tion that he was in active service
J in the field.
The fact that a general of such
note has been given command in
Transylvania apparently means- that
y , an Important campaign In this Aus
' trian territory is under way. A new
' Teutonic offensive successfully
pressed there would place Rumania
between two fires, as large forces of
the central powers are in the field in
the southern Rumanian province of
Dobrudja under another of Germany's
martial heroes, Field Marshal von
Mackensen.
Desperate Fight In the Somme.
Desperate fighting has been in pro
gress along the northern end of the
Somme front, where, the British have
recently made Important inroads upon
German positions soutuh of the
An ere.
London today reports heavy coun
ter attacks by the Germans near the
Stuff redoubt and the Hessian trench
and declares that a division of the
new rltish army acquitted itself most
tqm creditably in beating off the Germans,
jl Further down the line toward the
I Somme the French have resumed their
I attacks, pushing fuurther the wedge
C Into the German lines in the recion
t wot Rancourt. The new French ad
' I vnnce, according to Paris, was1 scored
r by means of hand grenade operations
north of Rancourt.,
X The British lost heavily In the fight-
ing on the Somme front during Sop-
tember. This Is indicated by the
casualty lists, "which show tho casual
's ties on all fronts during the month to
and menhavo been nearly 120,000 offi
iS cehs and men, or at the rate of more
1 than 3, 800 a day.
fL In Macedonia, the Bulgarians report
Y a success in the Kaimakcalan region
! near the Serbian border where a
y trench of the main Serbian position
was captured after a Serbian attack
had been repulsed. No important
V; changes elsewhere In Macedonia or
L' in Dobrudja are announctd.
Petrograd reports that there have
J been no Important happenings either
f on the Russian front or in the Cau
V casus.
r Berlin, Sept. 30 (via London, 5:30
. p. m.) Troops under General von
'i Falkenhayn, former chief of the gen
eral staff, have won a battle at Her-
mannstadt, Transylvania, defeating
fi strong sections of tho first Rumanian
:j . army, the war office -announced to-
day.
I . Desperate Fight In Progress.
London, Sept. 30 (1235 p. m.) Un
usually heavy fighting occurred yes-j
terday on the Somme front in conse
quence of German counter-attacks. A
division of the new British army was
engaged.
' The official account of the?e opcr-
i atlbns follows:
."During the night the enemy shelled
! heavily our battle front south of the
Ancre. We consolidated the ground
von yesterday morning at Destremont
farm, northwest of the Le Sars and
improved our position in the Thlepval
I area.
! "Enemy counter-attacks were beat
en off In tho neighborhood of Stuff re
doubt and Hessian trench. The fight
ing in this section yestorday was very
severe and our troops engaged a dlvl
I Elbn of the new army, showing great
endurance and resolution.
. "A successful raid was made by a
. London territorial battalion south of
Neuville St. Vaast, where the enemy's
trenches were entered and prisoners
; were taken."

MARQUARD PLAYS
WONDERFUL GAME
Carries Brooklyns Back to
Leadership Team
Wins 6 to 1.
ALEXANDER LOST SPEED
Philadelphians Win Morning
Game But Fail to Clinch
Lead.
Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, N. Y., Sept.
30. "Rube" Marquard carried the
Brooklyns back into tho National
league leadership this afternoon by
pitching a wonderful game against
Philadelphia. The score was: Brook
lyn, 6; Philadelphia, 1. Marquard
turned the Philadelphia batter back
time after time and allowed thm only
three hits, two of which came in the
first inning and resulted In Philadel
phla's lone run.
Alexander, on whom Manager Pat
IMoran depended to clinch the lead
which the Philadelphians had cap
tured by defeating the home folks in
the morning game, was hammered
savagely by tho Brooklyn batters.
Stengel's batting was a feature. His
home-run in the fifth inning unstead
ied Alexander who seemed to lose his
speed and much of his quick breaking
curve after that. Brooklyns have now
four games with the on-rushing New
York Giants, while Philadelphia re
turns home for their final series of
six games with the Boston Nationals.
Brooklyn's defense scintillated today.
Final 'score: R. H. E.
Philadelphia l 3 1
Brooklyn 615 1
Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, N. Y., Sept
; 30. The Philadelphians captured tho
' lead in the National league pennant
1 hunt this morning by defeating the.
Brooklyns, 7 to 2. Manager Robinson
I sent his star pitcher, Pfeiffer, to the I
mound to check the Philadelphians'
advance, but he -was hammered hard
consistently and his service failed to
baffle the bats of the visitors. Lu
derus helped himself to two two-baggers
and a home-run. Brooklyn could
do little with Rixey's delivery. The
game was played on a wind-swept
field.
Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, N. Y., Sept.
30. To wrest the National league
leadership now held by the Brooklvns
by a scant half game, the Phlladel

tion today by engaging the enemy in
a morning and afternoon game. A
brisk cold day followed the bad weath
er of yesterday when a downpour post
poned hostilities until this morning.
Several hundred spectators were on
hand to witness the morning combat
In which Pfeiffer for Brooklyn and
Rixey for Philadelphia again opposed
each other on the pitching mound.

Gtl5 MA!
Tho exemplification of the fable
of tho two cats and the monkey, the
monkey eating the cheese while the
cats looked on, Is presented In a re
port from James H. Houston, ranger
on the Sevier national forest In south
ern Utah of an incident that involved
the carcass of a colt, a mountain Hon,
a "noun dawg," yellow In color, and
a life sized coyote.
Tho report was received at Ogden
district forest headquarters today.
Tho ranger's is to the effect that
stockgrowers in tho vicinity of tho
Hollow Grove Ranger Station in the
forest and had set traps for the moun
tain lion, which was believed to have
been responsible for the death of two
valuable colts.
The traps were properly baited and
several coyotes were caught Anoth
er night all the traps were sprung
but nothing was to be found In them
the next morning. Tho stockmen, not
to be outwitted, reset tho traps In
tho hope of catching the slayer of
Early the next morning a stockman
was awakened by yelping, snarling
and growling coming from tho place
where two of the traps had been set
He arose and went out to Investigate.
He had made a catch. One trap held
firmly to the stockman's yellow hound
dog. A coyote had been caught in
the grip of the other. Yelping with
pain and floundering about in the ef
fort to bo released, the distress of
the two imprisoned animals was In
tensified through the appearance of
the mountain lion, dragging the car
cass of one of the colts it had killed
a few nights before. Reaching a point
within a foot of the imprisoned ani
mals, the lion lay down beside the
dead colt and proceeded to devour It
while dog and coyoto looked on.
The ranger's report also Included
reference to the campaign of destruc
tion of predatory animals In the
campaign, stating that poison opera
tions bqing carried on by tho forest
officers In co-operation with the
stockmen's organizations had to be
suspended because of strychnine used
in baiting was not obtainable.
