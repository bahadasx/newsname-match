IMPORTANT GAINS BY
FRENCH AND BRITISH
OVER AN EXTENT OF NEARLY FOUR MILES
Between the Villages of Forest and Clery, South of
Combles and East of Maurepas
Advance of the Allies is Closing in on Combles, Which is at
Present a Powerfully Fortified German Stronghold
Germans Have Returned to Their Attacks in the Verdun
Sector and Have Gained a Foothold in One of the French
Salients German and Bulgarian Troops Have Crossed
the Dobrudja Frontier in Southeastern Rumania
Furious Battles Are in Progress Between Russian and
' Austro-German Forces in Galicia East and Southeast of
Lemberg.
A combined attack by French and
British forces on the Somme front
Sunday resulted in an important gain
of ground between the villages of For
est and Clery. which lie south of
Combles and east of Maurepas, over an
extent of nearly four miles. These two
places were occupied by the French,
while the British captured a part of
the village of Ginchy and gained total
possession of Guillemont. Thus the
advance of the allies is closing in on
Combles, Which at present is a power
fully fortified German stronghold.
In the 'various attacks launched by
the British and French upwards of
3,000 prisoners wert taken, together
with a large number of guns. The
artillery action prior to the infantry
attacks was of great intensity along
the Forest-Clery sector, while both
British and French inaugurated fur
ther attacks at various other points.
The German positions cast of . the
village of Fleury were also overrun by
the French, whc carried several trench
es and organized works
The Germans returned to their at
tacks in the Verdun sector, sending
large forces of infantry against the
French positions at Vaux and Chapi
tre, and, after heavy fighting, gaining
a foothold in one of the French sali
ents. At all points apparently the
fighting continues with the utmost
ferocity.
ENTENTE SHIPS SINK
A GERMAN SUBMARINE.
Austro-German Residents in
Thrown Into a Panic.
Athens
Athens, Sept. 2. via London Sept. .1.
Ships of the entente fleet sank a Ger
man submarine this morning off Phal
eron. Entente military officers claim
the undersea boat had received its
supplies from the Austrian and Ger
man ships Which were seized in the
harbor of Piraeus today by French
sailors.
A number of destroyers of the en
tente fleet made a careful reconnais
sance near the arsenal this afternoon.
They put down anti-submarine nets
and nosed close to where the Lemnos
and the Kilkis. formerly the United
States battleships MississipDi and
Idaho, were lying.
It is currently believed here that the
entente fleet lesires to establish a
naval base at Piraeus as a base of sup
plies for tha entente allied army's west
wing on the Macedonian front, which
could be more easily supplied by rail
from Piraeus than from Saloniki.
Should this action prove to be of mili
tary value to the entente powers, the
Greek government, it Is understood,
will not object.
The seizure of the Austrian and
German merchant ships at Piraeus and
the occupation 'by entente troops of the
Greek wifeless station last (Friday)
night threw the Austro-German resi
dents In Athens, and especially the
agents of the German government, into
panic.

In the Balkans, German and Bulga
rian troops have already crossed the
Dobrudja frontier, in southeastern Ru
mania, doubtless with the object of
preventing the advance of the Russians
through that territory into Bulgaria
and possibly to Constantinople.
Furious battles are in progress be
tween Russian and Austro-German
forces in Galicia east and southeast of
Lemberg. Berlin reports the repulse
of the Russians, but Petrograd de
clares that the Teutons have . been
driven from fortified positions and that
several heights have been captured.
Great Britain and France have sent
a note to the Greek government de
manding control over the Greek posts
and telegraphs and insisting upon the
deportation from Greece of agents of
the central powers. Despatches from
Athens say it is understood that the
Greek government will make no objec
tion to the acceptance of these de
mands. Allied ships have sunk a Ger
man submarine off Phaleron. Unofficial
reports from the Greek capital inti
mate the early announcement of an
important change in the attitude of
Greece.
The Austrian artillery on the Tren
tino front is actively engaged in shell
ing the Italians. There have been nu
merous infantry engagements, but the
situation on the Austro-Italian frontier
is without material change.

trict. Manchester, N. H., Sept. 3. Ar
rangements were virtually finished
today for bringing out the voters at
the biennial state primaries next
Tuesday to select candidates for the
November election.
One of the most interesting contests
in the campaign has been in the
First Congressional district, where

is now 77 years old, and has been
prominent in the national house of
represenfeitives for nearly twenty
years, has two opponents for the re

mary this year but may write the
name of candidates they favor on the

ANGLO-FRENCH DEMANDS
MADE UPON GREECE
For Control Over the Greek Posts and
Telegraphs.

ens of Great Britain and France this
evening presented to the Greek gov
ernment a note demanding control
over the Greek posts and telegraphs
and insisting on the deportation from
Greece of agents of the central pow
ers. The nate reads as follows:
"By order of their governments, the
undersigned ministers of France and
Great Britain have the honor to bring
the following communication to the
attention of the Greek government:
"First The two allied governments
having from a sure source learned
that their enemies receive informa
tion in divers ways and notably
through the agency of the Greek teie
graprs, demand the control of tire
posts and telegraphs, including the
wireless system.
"Second Enemy agents employed
in corruption and espionage must im
mediately leave Greece, not to return
until the conclusion of hostilities.
"Third Necessary measures have
been taken against such Greek sub
jects as rendered themselves guilty of
complicity in the above mentioned
corruption and espionage."
The note formed the subject of a
conference between King Constantine,
Premier Zaimis and Dr. Streit, a for
mer minister of foreign affairs. It is
understood that there will be no ob
jection by the Greek government to
acceptance of the Anglo-French de
mands. JAPAN PRESENTS FOUR '

"Second the withdrawal of Chi
nese troops from the district in which

"Third Indemnification of the fam
ilies of the Japanese killed.
"Fourth the granting to Japan of

The Japanese insist that the de
mands are light, but the Chinese offi
cials regard them, as virtually an
elimination of Chinese authority in
inner Mongolia.
Chen Chin-Tao, the acting Chinese
minister of foreign affairs, is with
holding his reply to Japan until full
reports are available from a special
agent wno nas Deen sent to Chen

Thirteen Zeppelin
Airships in Raid
OVER EASTERN COUNTIES OF
ENGLAND SATURDAY NIGHT
TWO KILLED, 13 INJURED
Only Three of the Airships Were Able
to Approach the Outskirts , of Lon
don and One of Those Was Shot
Down No Military Damage Done.
London. Sept 3. 6.42 p. m. Thirteen
Zeppelin airships took part in the raid
over the eastern counties last night
and an dofficial statement issued this
afternoon says it was the most form
idable attack by air ever made on
England., One man and one woman
were killed and thirteen persons were
injured. Only three of the Zeppelins
were able to approach the outskirts
of London. One of these was shot
down and the other two were driven
off by aircraft guns and aeroplanes.
A communition Issued by the field
marshal commanding in chief of the
home forces at six o'clock thi seven
ing said:
Casualty List Small.
"Careful inquiries show that the
casualties and damage caused by the
air raid last night were quite dis
proportionate to the number of ships
empl(yed. The number of casualties
which have been reported are as fol
lows :
"Killed One man, one woman.
"Injured Eleven men and women
and two children.
London Escaped Lightly.
"No casualties occurred in the
metropolitan police district. Latest
reports show that in the metropolitan
police district twenty-five houses and
some outbuildings were slightly dam
aged. The water mains were cut and
three horses killed.
No Military Damage.
"Elsewhere the damage was very
slight, a certain number of cottagers
being damaged as well as a church,
while a fire occurred at some gas
works. There was no military dam
age of any sort."
Describing the raid, an official state
ment given out this afternoon says:
"Last night's raid was carried out
by thirteen airships and thus was the
most formidable attacK that has been
made on this country. The principal
theater of operations was the eastern
counties and the objectives seem to
have betn London and certain indus
trial centers in the midlands.
Darkness Proved Protective.
"The measures taken for the reduc
tion or obscuration of lights un
doubtedly proved most efficacious, for
the raiding squadrons instead of steer
ing a steady course as in the raids of
the spring and of last autumn, groped
about in darkhess for a safe avenue to
approach their objectives.
Airship Seen to Burst Into Flames.
"Three airships only were able to
approach the outskirts or London. One
of them appeared over the northern
district about 2.15 in the morning
where she was picked up by search
lights and heavily engaged by anto
aircraft guns and aeroplanes. After
a few minutes the airship was seen to
burst into flames and fall rapidly to
wards the earth.
Zeppelin Destroyed.
"The ship was destroyed, the wreck
age, the engines and half-burned
bodies of the crew being found at
Curfley, near Enfield. Experts hope to
reconstruct certain portions of the
framework. The large amount of
wood employed in the framework of
the Zeppelin is startling and would
seem to point to a shortage cf alum
inum in Germany.
"The other two ships which ap
proached London were driven off by
the defences without being able to ap
proach the center of the city.
Great Number of Bombs Dropped.
"A great number of bombs were
dropped promiscuously over the East
Anglain and southeastern counties,
many of them falling either into the
sea or in remote country districts.
"It is hoped that any persons who
picked up fragments of the wrecked
airships will submit them to general
headquarters without delay. If of
no value in the reconstruction of the
airship they will be returned to their
owners it should be remembered
that the retention of such articles is a
contravention of the Defense and
Realm regulations."
Raid .Lasted Several Hours.
The raid which lasted from late last
night until early this morning, did
not afford Londoners such a spectacle
as did those of this time last year, al
though from many parts of the city
people were awakened by the firing
and saw one of the riders falling in
flames in the north.
Observers say the death agony of
the Zeppelin lasted a minute and a
half.
The night was perfect. It was very
dark with few stars and with no wind
or rain to interfere with their man
oeuvres. CROWDS GREET PRESIDENT

Propose to Test Constitutionality,
How long peace shall reign as a re
sult of the bill apparently is depend
ent upon development in the proposed
move to test the constitutionality of
the act. Should the railroads take
no action, but await the beginning of
an investigation of the workings of
the eight hour day by the special
committee for which the measure
provides, the brotherhoods will re
main inactive. The employes' leaders
declare, however, that should the law
be held unconstitutional and the rail
roads attempt to restore the ten hour
day, a strike will follow promptly.
