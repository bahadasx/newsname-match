the eight-hour day law on the cost
of operation of railroads and to re

consideration tomorrow.
Senators Simmons and Martin and

6 o'clock Wednesday evening. The sen
ate will defer action on the resolution
until It determines that all necessaiy

time.
Senator Simmons said an effort

nesday to complete their report on
senate amendments.
There was light attendance in both
houses today.
President Shrned Bill Sunday.
Labor day brought no cessation of
activity to congress which today
hoped for adjournment Wednesday
or Thursday. Many members already

homes. The Webb bill to allow Amer
ican exporters to organize common
selling agencies abroad, the recmie
bill and the Porto Kit an titizenship
bill were to be acted on in the senate.
Congressional leaders planned to
postpone consideration of the immigra
tion and corrupt practices bills and
farther railroad strike measures.
The eight hour day act, passed Sat
urday evening, was considered a law
today, having received President V.'il
Bon's signature yesterday but to avoid
any chance of its being held void on
the ground that it received executive
approval on a legal holiday, the presi
dent will sign it again tomorrow on
his return from Hodgenville, Ky.,
where to lay he attended Lincoln me
morial exercises.
HUMAN LABOR IS
ABOVE COMMERCE
CoTernor Dunne in Labor Day Speech
IIeiews JU-eord of State and
National Bodies.
Farmington. 111., Sept. 4. Governor
Edward F. Dunne, in an address at a
Labor day celebration here today, re
viewed the labor records of the nation
al and state administrations and said
he believed they w ere "remarkable and
thoroughly satisfactory to the toiling
millions of the land."
The most significant declaration ever
written into a statute regarding labor,
eiM the governor, is first line of sec
tion six of the riayton anti-trust law
which says: "The labor of human bo
ln$s Is not a commodity or article of
commerce."
The enactment of the state work
men's compensation law and the crea
tion of an industrial board to admin
ister that law he referred to as -per-haps
the greatest benefit ever con
ferred upon those who have to toll."
GOLD PENS USED TO
SIGN STRIKE BILL
GOTO LABOR HEADS
Washington, Sept, 4. There were
four exceptionally valuable gold pens
In Washington today, and one each was
In the possession of one of the four
brotherhood chiefs who led their men
to victory in the work hour and wage
fht with the railroads.
President Wilson used the pens In
igning the eight-hour railroad work
lay bill, using a gold pen for each of
&e four syllables of his name, "Wood
row Wilson."
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
brotherhoods, said as to his pen:
'"I shall fashion with it a sentence
expressive of its historic association,
nd I shall frame that sentence and
fcang it in my home. To no other use
thall the pen be put, but I shall keep
nd treasure it always."
A railroad man suggested that Mr.
Garretson could do no better than copy
Caesar's line: "Veni, vidi, vici (I came.
I saw, I conquered).
Mr. Garretson will take a year's
rest, which he was voted recently by
tU organization because of his health.

Swiss Lose Market.
Berne, Switzerland. That the Swiss
embroidery trade Is more and more
losing its American market appears
from recently published figures. While
in 1907 the value of Swiss embroidery
exported to the United States was 76.
000.000 francs, it fell to 30.000.000 in
1914 and to 26,000,000 in 1915. The
decrease is attributed to increased
American production. In the last dec
ade Swiss embroidery exportation to
England Increased from 16,000.0ft0 to
52,000,000 francs. The total Swiss ex
portation since 1896 is valued at over

Graphic Story of Sunday Battle,
With the British Armies in France,
Sept 3, (via London, Sept. 4, 5:35 a. m.)
It was "by the right flank," In the
concerted Anglo-French attack on the
Somme front today, with the great bat
tle which never has ceased for two
months, flaming up into a general con
flict, that Kitchener's new army
charged the flower of the German-
the Prussian guards four divisions of
which were concentrated before the
British to stay the British offensive. In
places the emperor's favorite troops
were driven back, counter attacked,
and again had to yield their crimsoned,
shell-wrecked trenches to stubborn
English and Scotch, most of whom two
years ago did not know how to form
fours.
The attack was not simultaneous,
nor was it along the whole line. Dif
ferent sections were timed with clock
work regularity, while the French and
English acted together as if one army.
By the (roar of the guns In the early
morning along the whole front no ob
server could have told where the blows
were to fall. Against Thiepval no ef
fort was made. But Just before dawn
their infantry rushed the old first line
trenches at certain points both north
and south of the Ancre.
The first stage of the infantry action
was entirely on this flank and at Mo
quet farm, where the Australians were
at it again. They pushed through It
and beyond it. Nothing more pictur
esque had happened in the Somme bat
tle than these hardy ranchmen, who
can shoot and ride, smooth shaven, la
conic, bred out of doors, going against
the Prussian guards.
Murderous Work of Gnns.
Later in the morning, the big busi
ness of the day began from Devil's
wood southward through to the Somme.
All the murderous power on both sides,
guns and machine gun3, was exerted
to the utmost.
Gulllemont was the prize the British
sought. Two weeks ago this village
was the most completely devastated on
any on the front and the British had
been pounding it day after day with
every calibre of gun. Gulllemont no
longer is a village, but an iron andj
lead mine. Twice the British had car
ried their charges into it. and even
through it, only to be forced out. It is
estimated that 200,000 shells were fired
into it and that 3,000,000 of bullets
traversed it.
Sapping forward and connecting up
shell craters into trenches, the British
worked their way, aided by occasional
charges, but the Germans established
themselves in a small trench salient
southwest of the village where they
were only 30 or 40 yards from the Brit
ish and so near that the British guy
dared not fire on them for fear of hit
ting their own men. Here the Ger
mans had a machine gun bo placed that
it swept the span between the
trenches, but the British managed to
get across, and. about midday, swept
toward Gulllemont. cleaning up nests
of machine guns and across the fields
on the other side, establishing them
selves in a sunken road. But south of
Guillemont one section of the Prussian
guard resisted desperately in Falfe
mont farm and Wedgewood and here
all the afternoon bombing and hand
to hand fighting was proceeding. Hers
