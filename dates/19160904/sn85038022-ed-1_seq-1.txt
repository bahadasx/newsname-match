To Make Legality of Hill

Washington. September 3 The
AdamBon eight-hour day bill, exacted
from Congress last week by the rail
road brotherhoods as the price of call
ing off the nation-wide strike ordered
for tomorrow, waa Blgned by Presi
dent Wilson today In hla private car
at the Union Station where he stop
ped on his way from Shadow l.awu.
N. J., to Hodgenvllle, Ky. That titers
may be no question as to the legality
of the measure as a result of it hav
ing been signed on Sunday, the Presi
dent will affix his signature again
upon his return to Washington next
Tuesday.
How long peace ahall reign as a
result of the bill apparently la de
pendent upon developments in the
proposed move to test the constitu
tionality of the act. Should the rail
roads take no action, but await the
beginning of the eight-hour day by the
special commission for which the
measure provides, the brotherhood?
will remuln inactive. The employes'
leaders declare however, that should
the law be held unconstitutional and
the railroads attempt to restore the
ten-hour day on their lines, a strlk.
will follow promptly.
Brotherhood heads in a circular let
ter to their members today made no
comment on the measure passed. They
merely pointed out that It would not
become effective until next January 1,
and that many things might occur be
tween now and then which would
change materially any suggestions 01
comment they might make.
Labor Leader Absent
None of the brotherhood leaders
witnessed the signing of the bll!
They had expected according to ten
tative arrangements made by Secre
tary Wilson last night, to be present,
but the president decided to attend
to the business at the rail roan- sta
tion and newspaper correspondents
gave them their first information
about it. The four pens used by the
President in signing the bill one for
each syllable of his name will be
presented to the four brotherhood
heads, A. B. Garretson, W. Q. Lee
W. H. Carter and W. 8. Stone, alter
being used for resigning the bill on
Tuesday.
No ceremony attended tho signing
tcday. It originally had been plan
ned that the President should go to
the White House, but this was
changed and instead, Rudolph For
ster, assistant secretary to the Presi
dent, took the bill to the train. Near
the car window a group of trainmen
in their overall paused in their work
long enough to watch the President
write his name. An engineer passing
on a yardl engine celebrated the oc
casion with several prolonged blasts
of his whistle.
