AN3 CASUALTIES NOT RECEIV
ED—MANT BOMBS ARE DROP
FED.
London, Sept 4.—Thirteen Zeppelin
airships took part in the raid over
the eastern counties Saturday night,
and an official statement Issued last
evening says It was the most formid
able attack by air ever made on Eng
land. Only three of the Zeppelins
were able to approach the outskirts
of London. One of these was shot
down and the other two were driven
off by aircraft guns and aeroplanes.
Reports regarding the number of
casualties and the damage caused by
the great number of bombs dropped
had not been completed last evening,
but it was stated the damages and
loss of life were not heavy "consider
ing the number of shlpB engaged
The text of the official statement
said:
"Last Saturday night's raid was
carried out by thirteen airships, and
thus was the most formidable attack
that had been made on this country.
The principal theater of operations
was the eastern counties, and the ob
to have been London
and certain industrial centers in the
Midlands.
"The measure taken for the reduc
tion or obscuration of lights undoub
tedly proved most efficaoious, for the
raiding squadrons instead of steering
a steady course as in the raids of the
spring and of last autumn, groped
about in darkness looking for a safe
avenue to approach their objectives.
"Three airships only were able to
approach the outskirts of London.
One of them appeared over the nor
thern district about 1:15 In the morn
ing, where she was picked up by
searchlights and heavily engaged by
anti-aircraft guns and aeroplanes,
after a few minutes the airship was
seen to burst into flames and fall rap
idly towards earth.
"The ship was destroyed, the
wreckage, engines and half burned
bodies of the crew being found at Cuf
ley, near Enfield.
"Experts hope to reconstruct cer
tain portions of the framework. The
large- amount of wood employed in
the framework of the Zeppelin is
startling and would seem to point to a
shortage of aluminum In Germany.
"The other two ships which ap
proached London were driven off by
the defenses without being able to ap
proach the center of the city.
"A great number of bombs were
dropped promiscuously over the East
Anglian and southeastern counties,
but complete reports as. to casualties
and damage have not yet been re
ceived. Those in hand Indicate that
the damage and loss of life will not
be heavy considering the number of
ships engaged, a great number of the
bombs dropped having fallen either
into the sea or In remote country dis
tricts-
"It is hoped that any persons who
picked up fragments of the wrecked
airship will submit them to general
headquarters without delay. If of no
value in the reconstruction of the air
ship they will be returned to their
owners. It should be remembered
that the retention of such articles Is
a contravention of the defense of the
realm regulations.
."A statemet of casualties will be Is
sued tomorrow."
The Zeppelin raid did not .afford
Londoners the spectacle that did
those of this time last year, although
from many parts of the dty people
awakened by the firing saw one of the
raiders falling In flames.
News of the raid circulated Oaring

Bismarck, N.? D., Sept. 4.—That
there is no deficit in the state treas

a result of any Action by this admin
istration or of the board of equaliza
tion is the assertion made by Gover
nor Hanna when his attention was
called to statements published to the
effect that the administration which
takes charge next January would
face a deficit o* from $400,000 to
$600,000.
"There will be no eeflclt of $600,
000 or of $400*000," said the governor.
There will be no deficit whatever.
All the matured obligations of the
state have been met. Every bill has
been paid. There is now some $300,
000 in the treasury. The levies Just
made by the board or equalization
will yield about $2,000,000, which is
Just about what Is required to operate

"It is true that some bills will be
carried -over into the new year, but
there is nothing alarming in this,
nothing new, and nothing improper.
This has been the case ©very year
since the state was organized. It is
due to' the fact that while the ex
penses of the gtate run along as usual
in the closing months of the year, the
revenues are then at their lowest
point. This is a condition common
to all states. Minnesota, New York
and many other statjes have provided
by law for the bridging of this gap,
and certificates of indebtedness are
Issued to take care of bills until re

no such law, and it is always neces

our state has no deficit, and will have
none."

New York, Sept. 4.—Freight traffic
on all railroads entering New York,
interrupted by embargoes due to the
fear of a strike, was moving again to
day on normal schedule, and railroad
men say little congestion resulted
from the brief embargoes. Large
quantities of merchandise had been
shipped immediately previous to the
Issuance-of the hold-up orders.
This being a holiday, shipments will
be lighter than ordinarily on Monday
and the roads will have an opportuni
ty to catch up with the regular order
of freight movements.
"By Tuesday morning," said P. J.
Flynn, vice president of the Lacka
wanna, "all great arteries of traffic
will be operating on normal basis,
just as if there never had been any
strike talk."
The big task before the railroads
is demobilizing the forces of strike

it is said, being employed on con

some even more to run. Provision

Submersible Off
Phaleron.
Athens, Sept. 3, via London, Sept. 4.
—Ships of the Entente allied fleet
sank a German submarine yesterday
off Phaleron. It is claimed by Entente
military officers that the undersea
boat had received its supplies from
Austrian and German ships which
were seized In the harbor of Piraeus
yesterday by French sailors.
A number of destroyers of the En
tente fleet made a careful reconnais
sance in the neighborhood of the ar
senal yesterday afternoon. They put
down anti-submarine nets and nosed
close to where the Lemnos and the
Kilkie, formerly the U. S. battleships
Mississippi and Idaho were lying. It
is currently believed here that the
Entente fleet desires to establish a
naval base at Piraeus as a base of
supplies for the Entente allied armies'
west wing on the Macedonian front,
which could be more easily supplied
by rail from Piraeus than from Salon
iki. Should this action prove to be of
military value to the Entente powers,
the Greek government, it is under
stood will not object.
The selsure of the Austrian and
German merchants ships at Piraeus
and the occupation by Entente troops
of the Greek wireless station last
night threw the Austro-German resi
dents in Athens and especially the
agents of the German government In
to a panic.
Toward midnight, newsboys shout
ing "extras" in the streets, attracted
the employes of Baron Von Schenck,
the director of German propaganda
in Greece, from the hotel In their
night clothes to learn their fate. The
impossibility of communicating to
their home government by wireless
telegraphy added to their consterna

Make No Comment.
Brotherhood heads in a circular let-,
ter to their members made no com-'
ment on the measure as passed. They
merely pointed out that it would not'
become effective until next January
1 and that many things might occur
between now and then which would!
change materially any suggestions or
comment they might make.
Xone of the brotherhood leaders
witnessed the signing of the bill. They,
had expected, according to tentative
arrangements made by Secretary
Tumulty Saturday night to be present,
but the president decided to attend
to the business at the railroad station
and newspaper correspondents gave
them their first information about it.

in signing the bill—one for each

No ceremony attended the signing.
Originally it had been planned that
the president should go to the White
House, but this was changed, and in
stead, Rudolph Forester, assistant sec-'
retary to the president, took the bill
to the train.
Near the car window a group of
trainmen in their overalls paused in
their work long enough to watch the
president write his name. An en
gineer. passing on a yard engine, cele
brated the occasion with several pro

While at the station the president
sent Secretary Tumulty to the home
of Majority Leader Kern of the senate
to urge that the senate pass the Webb
bill, passed Saturday by the house,
designed to permit American firms to
utilize common selling agencies abroad
without violating the Sherman anti
trust law.
Later the president and Mrs. Wil

the city. During their absence the
private car was attached to a special
