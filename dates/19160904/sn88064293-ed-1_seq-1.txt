The Charenton shell beach j
resort continues to be the fav- j
ored spot for summer visitors |
from various places. We learn !
that a large party from Lafay
ette went there last Monday j
and the place was so crowded ;
j
that they failed to , v accommo
dations and were forced to re- j
turn home for that reason. :
When the buildings are erect- '
ed at Cote Blanche, which will
consume some months, this «
section will be supplied with
another fine resort right on
the sea. In the matter of water
ing places, St. Mary will be
ahead of all the parishes of
Louisiana with both fresh and
salt water with fine fishing at ;
both places.—Franklin Watch
