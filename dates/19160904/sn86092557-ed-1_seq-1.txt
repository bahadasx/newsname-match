; some harsTghiticism
i
i It Was Written Into Wilson's
Widely Read American
History
WASHINGTON, D. C.. Sept. 4.?A
comparison between the records of
President Wilson and Gov. Hughes Is
not to the credit of Mr. Wilson In the
eyes of organized labor. It is Immensely
to the credit of Gov. Hughes.
President Wilson has never shown
solicitude for the laboring men's welfare?his
efforts to settle the railroad
embrogllo was the first time the President
manifested the slightest interest
in labor's affairs, and that Interest was
pot due to any love for labor but to the
spul of public opinion which demanded
there should be no strike.
The dispute had been brewing many
months but the President waited until
a little more than sixty days before the
National election to summon the brotherhood
chiefs and the railroad heads
to Washington.
Perhaps there was a "psychological"
reason for that. If not the reason of
political advantage.
Labor unions are justified In looking
askance at the President In view
! of his spoken and written utterances
regarding labor.
In Mr. Wilson's "History of the
American People" he says: "The Chinese
were more to be desired as workmen,
if not as citizens, than most of
the coarse crew that'came crowding In
every year at the Eastern ports."
The "coarse crew" the President described
as "crowding In" Included the
millions of foreign-born persons of every
nationality who are now loyal citizens
of the United States.
In the same book the President said:
"And now there came rjultltudes of
men of the lowest class from the south
of Italy, and men of meaner sort out of
Hungary and Poland, men out of the
ranks where there was neither skill
nor energy nor any Initiative of quick
intelligence."
What do American citizens of German.
Italian, Hungarian, Polish, or
any European ancestry think of that?
On June 3. 1909. in an address to the
graduating class of Princeton University,
Dr. Wilson expressed his remarkable
views on labor in the following
words: "You know what the usual
sianaara 01 me einpiu; (;? id iu vjui
day. It Is to give as little as he may
for his wages."
At a dinner in the Waldorf Hotel in
New York. March 18. 1907, Dr. Woodrow
Wilson spoke as follows: "We
speak too exclusively of the capitalistic
class. There is another as formidable
an enemy to equality and freedom
of opportunity as it is, and that is the
class formed by the labor organizations
and leaders of the country."
Contrast the labor record of President
Wilson with the labor record of
Governor Hughes.
Governor Hughes has never written
or spoken a single word inimical to labor.
On the contrary he was the greatest
friend of labor that ever occupied
the governor's chair at Albany. Legislative
records at Albany show that
during his two terms as governor of
New York he signed 56 labor laws.
In New York state, during 132 years,
only 162 labor laws were passed. Onethird
of theBe were signed during
Hughes' two terms as governor.
With these records known it will be
easy for organized labor to select its
candidate in the November election.

PRESIDENT SIGNS ~~
EIGHT-HOUR BILL
*
Peace in the Railroad World
Is Merely a
Truce
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4.?The adam
Boa eight-hour day bill, exactly
from CongreBs last week by the railroad
brotherhoods as the price of calling
off the nation-wide strike ordered
for today was signed by President
Wilson yesterday in his private car at
the Union Station where he stopped on
Hodgenville, Ky.
his way from Shadow Lawn N. J., to
That there may be no question as
o the legality of the measure as a result
of it having been signed on Sunday
the President wi]l affix bis signature
aaln upon his return to Washington
next Tuesday.
How long peaceful reign as a result
of the bill apparently is dependent
upon developments in the proposed
move to test the constitutionality ot the
act. Should the railroads take no action
but await the beginning ot an investigation
of the workings ot the
eight-hour day by the special commission
for which the measure provides,
the brotherhoods will remain Inactive.
The employes' leaders declare, however
that should the law be held unconstitutional
and the rai]roads attempt
to restoris the 10-hour day on their
line' a strike wil] follow propmptly.
