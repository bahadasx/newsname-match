joints to~Tendencies
ury of "Preparedness" Seized
to Emphasize the Need of
Better Labor Conditions.
(BT ASSOCIATED PNtSt>
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4.?Frank
Morrison, secretary of the American
Federation of Labor, has Just made
public the following statement In re
view- of the labor situation:
"It is Impossible to record funda
mental agitation or to individualize
probable gains during the year to
come.
"The best we can do is to observe
tendencies. Prominent among these
is the workers' seizure of the cry for
'preparedness* to emphasize a danger
in Industry more deadly than battle
' fields.
Thousands Are Killed.
"Government statistics show that
30,000 men arc annually killed and
700,000 are annually injured for a
period of four weeks, or over.
"It has been stated that every year
there are over 3,000,000 case of in
lustrlai illness, caused mainly by long
hours, low wages, dust, bad air,
fumes, smoke, po'sonings, and poor
ventilation and that through typhoid
rever and miliaria alone <000,000,000
is annually lost to this nation.
Enough to equip the largest army and
navy in the world, and then have a
balance sufficient to pay the tuition
of even- boy now In college.
Should Prevent Waxing?.
"A system of national prepared
ness that does not Include recogni
tion of this frightful and preventa
ble wastage is the preparedness urged
by big business. A morality that Ig
nores these facts and condemns war
la baaed on meaningless phrases.
"Another present-day tendency is
the acceptance of organized labor's
position on immigration restriction.
During the last year the acid test of
?xperlence has verified the claim of
trade unions that American institu
tions can not assimilate, nor Ameri
can living standards resist, the flood
:ides of Induced immigration that has
been the policy of captains of Indus
try. Information and reports receiv
ed by the officers of the American
Federation of Labor clearly demon
strates the fact that a 'labor famine'
wlsts only where employers still de
mand long hours at low wages, and
(chore they ignore the living stand
jrds set by the workers. Another
plement among employers who talk
af the scarcity of labor do so to entice
i sufficient number of idle workers
to their factory gates as a menace to
those employed and who are liable
to demand better conditions. These
employers oppose restriction of im
migration because restriction will de
feat their policy of having two or
more men for every job.
Op|>?Hi(ton to Injunctions.
"Another'tendency is the growing
opposition to labor injunctions, which
class labor power as property. The
Congress of the United StateB has
voiced this opposition In amendments
to the anti-trust laws. Judicial in
terpretations or the term 'property"
In the fourteenth amendment to the
federal constitution are losing their
