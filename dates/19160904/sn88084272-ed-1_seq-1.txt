The police having failed to preserve I

and were patroling the streets after
that time
Companies E and F. or the Seventh
United States infantrj, were the first
troops to be ordered out These were
instructed to send all militiamen and
other soldiers to their camps at once
to prevent them taking any part in the
strike demonstration
It was announced at the provost mar

on strike duty, but were assisting the
provost guards in handling the soldiers
only.
Several prominent citizens are known
to have urged Gen. George Bell and
CoL Charles W. Taylor to send troops
to the city Monday at noon to top the
rioting when the police proved so une

Shortly before that time, four of the

"Lawlessness is going to end in El Paso. I am as much ashamed as any

"I have given the chief orders to preserve order and am going to stand
