PREDICTS 8-HOUR DAY FOR ALL
MBRIOE—HIS
WORD IS GOOD
During the four years that Henry
Mcßride was governor of this state his
word was never in dispute, nor lias it
been challenged before or since.
J lis integrity and honesty are un
questioned.
Add to that his experience in the of
fice as governor, the breadth of vision
acquired by other occupations —as
teacher, lawyer, prosecutor, judge, lum
ber manufacturer; add to that a for
ward-looking grasp of conditions and
an honest sympathy for humanitarian
betterment.
Combine these, and you will observe
why Henry Mcßride is the best quali
fied man among all the eight candidates
for governor on the republican ticket.

trades of the city were repre
sented.
Gay With Color.
The Stars and Stripes carried
by the workers, and gay emblems
of the various local unions, made
the line of march gay with color.
. All along Pacific avenue the
sidewalks and curbs were crowd
ed with spectators.
The marchers kept step to live
ly music from five union bands
scattered along the line.
It was tabor's day.
IconKshoremen liead.
The great mass of longshore
men, all In white caps, led off the
parade, singing songs as they
marched, and carrying American
flags and banners telling that
they are on strike.

ma car shop trades, celebrating
the passage of the eight-hour day
law by congress.
With them marched the ma
chinists, boilermakers and black
smiths.

The cooks' and waiters' union
was the only one which did not
have a big representation in the
parade. Instead, they were rep
resented by an automobile bar
ing the sign:
"Our members are preparing
your dinner."
Prepare For Snorts.
Elaborate floats, displaying va
rious crafts were scattered
through the line.
Almost by the time the last of
the marchers had left Bth and Pa
cific the first of the column had
reached 9th and Broadway. From
there the parade headed up Sixth
avenue to Wright park where the
members of all unions, men, wom
en and children, prepared for the
program of sports and games this
afternoon.
The celebration will close to
night with a dance in Moose hall.
M'LEAN
OUT FOR
WILSON
The second luncheon of the
Woodrow Wilson Independent
league will be held in the Lotus
Grill Tuesday noon, with Henry
Albert McLean of Seattle, pro
gressive candidate for congress in
1912, as the principal speaker.
All progressives and support
ers of Wilson have been invited.
Also a special Invitation has
been extended to Tacoma women.
"The prospects of President
Wilson carrying this state are

POLICE UNABLE TO
FIND MURDER CLUE
With no direct evidence on
which to work, and no possibility
of bringing about an identifica
tion of the slayer, police officials
admitted Monday that the prob
lem of arresting the murderer of
Tillman Bethel, colored strike
breaker, was one of the most dif
ficult ever handled by the Taco
ma department.
LABOR SPEAKS!
I LABOR, am feeling my strength today,
my strength that digs your mines and
I works your factories, my strength that
welds your tools and builds your palaces, my

parent of your power, mother of might — my
strength that lets you live!
'TIS I, LABOR, that clothes your bodies and
fills your stomach; but for me would you run un
