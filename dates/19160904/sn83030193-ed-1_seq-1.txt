The whole of Gincliy at first was captured, but the British were
compelled to give ground, retaining hold of part of the village despite
heavy counter attacks in the course of the night. More than 800 Ger
mans were taken prisoners. This makes a total of 2,800 prisoners since
the oti'eiibive in this sector started.
