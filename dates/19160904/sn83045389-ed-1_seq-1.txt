No ceremony attended the signing;
to-day. It originally had been plan

White House, hut this was changed,
and, instead, Htidolph fforster, assistant ;
secretary to the President, took the
bill to the train. Near the car window
a group of trainmen in their overalls,
paused in their work long enough to
watch the President write his name.
.An englneeT, passing on a yard engine*
celebrated the occasion with several
prolonged blasts of his whistle.
While at the station the President j
also signed several commissions and I
executive papers and sent Secretary
Tumulty to the home of .Majority I

that tthe Senate pass the Webb bill, ^

The fart that the raid, which was the

the fact that the new regulations for

"In last night's raid thirteen airships,

"The other two ships which ap-j

this afternoon presented to the Greek

and insisting on the deportation from

The note reads as follows:
I "By order of their governments, the

antisubmarine nets, and nosed close to
(where the T.emtios and the K ilkis.

It is currently believed here that the

naval base at Piraeus, as a base of j

which could be more easily supplied by

Should this action provp to be of mill-j

Greek government, it Is understood, j
will not object.
The seizure of the Austrian and Ger

occupation by entente troops of the-;

Greece, from the hotels in their night

possibility of communicating to their

to the oast or Maurepns, over an ex-'
tent of nearly four miles. Thc*e two ^
places were occupied by the French,
while tlie British captured a iiart of
the village Ginchy ami gained total
possession of Guillemont. Thus the
advance of the entente allies is closing
in on f.'oinhles. which, at present, is
a powerfully fortified German strong
hold.
In tin: various attacks launched by
the British and French upwards of
mtO prisoners were taken, together with
a large nnniher of suns. The artillery
action prior to the infantry attacks
was of great intensity along the For
est -Glory sootor, whib both British
and French inaugurated further at
tacks at various other points.
The German positions east of the
village of Floury also were overrun by
the Krench, who carried several
trenches and organized works.
The Germans returned to their at
tacks in t lie Verdun sector, sending,
large forces of infantry against the!
Krench positions at Vans and Chapltre,
and. after heavy lighting, gaining a
foothold in one of the Krench salients.
At all points the lighting continues.
In the Balkans, the German and
Bulgarian troops already have crossed
the Liohrudja frontier. In Southeastern
Houmanla. doubtless with the object
of preventing the advance of the Rus
sians through that territory into Bul
garia. ami possibly to Constantinople.

Kurious battles are in progress be
tween Itussian and Austro-Gcrnian
forces in lialicla. Berlin reports the
repulse of the Russians, but Petro
grad declares that the Teutons have
been driven from fortified positions,
and that several heights have been
captured.
I Great Britain and France have sent
a note to the Greek government de
manding control over the Greek posts
and telegraphs and Insisting upon the
deportation from Greece of agents of
the central powers. Dispatches from
Athens say it is understood that the
Greek government will make no objec
tion to the acceptance of these de
mands. Kntente allied ships have sunk
a German submarine off l'haleron. I'n
ofllcial reports from the Greek capital
indicate the early announcement of an
important change in the attitude of
Greece.
The Austrian artillery on the Tron
tino front is actively engaged in shell
ing the Italians. There have been
numerous infantry engagements, but
thr> situation on the Aust ro-l talian
frontier is without material change.
