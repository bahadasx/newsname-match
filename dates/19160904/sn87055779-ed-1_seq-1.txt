GERMAN SUBMARINE
SUNK IN GREEK HARBOR
Allied Ship Send Down Undersea
Craft Off Phaleron Seize
Merchant Shis.
As?.v-i.itel Preps Service:
ATHENS, Sept. 2., via Ixmdon
Ships of tho entente allied fleet sank
a German submarine Saturady morn
ins off Phaleron. It claimed by
entente military officers that the un
dersea boat had received its supplies
from the Austrian and German ships
which were seized in the harbor of
Piraeus Satvrday by French sailors.
A number of destroyers of the
entente Meet made a careful recon
naissance in the neighborhood of the
arsenal Saturday afternoon. They
put down anti submarine nets and
nosed close to where the Ivomnos
and the Kilkis, formerly the Fnited
States battleships Mississippi and
Idaho, were lyins.
It is currently believed hero that
ihe entente Meet desirs to stablish a
naval has at Piraeus as a base of
supplies for the entente allied armies
west wins on the Macedonian front,
which could be more easily supplied
by rail from Piraeu than from Sa
loniki. Should this action prove to
be of military value to the entente
power., the Greek government, it is
understood, will not objeet.
Tne seizure of the Austrian and
German merchant ships at Piraeus
and the occupation by entente troop
of the Greek wireless station Iat
niht (Friday threw the Austro
German residents in Athens and es
pecially the agents of the German
-overnment into a panic.

CONGRESSMEN
RUSH FOR HOME
Exodus From Capital Begins.
Adjournment Expected on
Wednesday or Thursday.
Associated Press Service:
WASHINGTON, i'ept. Z. The con
gressional exodus, after nine event
ful months of legislation, already has
begun. With adjournment practi
cally assured by Wednesday or
Thursday, scores of members packed
their campaign speeches Saturday
nteht immediately after they had
saved the nation from a railroad
strike and rushed for trains bound
for political battlefields.
By midnight there had vanished
the quorum of the house which had
been held to gaiard atcainst any pos
sible slip betwixt the senate and the
white house in the progress of the
eight hour day bill. Many senators
also, satisfied that the emergency
levenue bill when pa-sed concluded
important business of the senate, de
parted for their homes or on cam
paign itineraries. Some are bound
for Maine to aid in the whirlwind
' finish planned by both parties in the
state and senatorial elections there
that will serve as a curtain raiser
for the national campaign.
All that remains on the adminis
trative legislative program in the
senate is the revenue bill and the
Webb bill to permit American ex
porters to establish combination
selling agencies abroad. Senate
leaders plan to incorporate the "Webb
bill into the revenue bill as an
amendment in order to assure quick
action on it. Ren. Summons, chair
man of the finance committee, con
ferred today with some of his col
leagues regarding the plan.
Informal conference on senate
amendments to the revenue bill are
already in progress and a report of
the conference committee will not
require much time, the leaders say.
The house is practically done with
everything" except the revenue con
ference report and can adjourn
whenever senate leaders give the
word.
Few Otxtaolrs Threaten.
There are a few odds and ends of
legislation for the senate to deal
with and a few obstacles still threa
ten to prolong the session, but ad
ministration heads say that nothing
could hold a quorum longer than
this week. It is probable that the
senate will take an hour or two to
pass the Porto Rico citizenship and
election bill, but no other measures
are on the program. The immigra
tion and corrupt practices bills, how
ever, are still on the calendar with
Sens. s?mith of South Carolina, and
Owen, ready to call them up if pos
sible. Sen. Owen insists that he will
demand a vote on a motion to take
up the corrupt practices bill. Re
publican senators will not have it,
however, and administration leader
are content to let the bill po over.
Should Sen. Owen attempt a filibus
lf.r. they insist that an adjournment
ie.solui.iou could be maneuvered to
take him oiT his feet. There is a
change that the immigration bill,
which Pres't Wilson his already de
clared he would veto, may be taken
up. Should this bo done, the bill
wem Id be forced to conference and
there it probabbly would remain
when the adjournment gavel fell.

Associated Pres? Service:
I)N'DON, Sept. 2. Thirteen Zep
pelin a.rships took part in tho raid
over the eastern counties Kutuiiiay
night, and an ollicial statement is
sued this afternoon says it was th
most lorinidaMe attack by air ever
made on Knpland. Only three of the
Zeppelias were able to approach the
outskirts of London. One of these
was shot down and the other two
were driven oft by aircraft guns and
aeroplanes.
Reports regarding the number of
casualties and the damage caused by
the great number of bombs dropped
had not been completed this after
noon, but it was stated that the
damages and loss of life were not
heavy, "considering the number of
ships engaged." An otficial state
ment in part said:
Invaders Lost in Darkness.
"The measure taken for the re
duction or obscuration of lights un
doubtedly proved most etticacious,
for the raiding squadrons instead of
steerinr a steady course as in the
raids of the spring and of last au
tumn, groped about in darkness
looking for a safe avenue to ap
proach their objectives.
"Three airships only were able to
approach the outskirts of London.
One of them appeared over the
northern district about -:15 in the
morninj? where she was picked up
by searchlights and heavily engaged
by anti aircraft guns and aeroplanes.
After a few minutes the airship was
seen to burst into tlames and fall
rapidly towards the earth.
W !tckacv Femnd.
"The ship was destroyed, the
wreckage, engines ami half burned
bodies of the crew being found at
Cufley, near Enfield.
"The other two ships vhioh ap
proached London were driven eff by
the defenses without beinj; able to
approach the center of the city.
"A great number of bombs were
dropped promiscuously over the
eastern Anglian and southeastern
counties, but complete reports as to
casualties and damage have not yet
been received."
A later official statement says, one
man and one woman were killed and
eleven men and two children were
injured. It adds: I
No Icatlis in City. i
"No casualties occurred on the'
metropolitan police district. Latest
reports show that in the metropo-'
litan police district 2 Ö houses and
wm cut -buildings were slightly
damagei. Tw o water mains w ere '
cut and three horses were killed.
"LIsewhere the damage was very
slight, a certain number of cottages
being damaged, as well as a church,
while a lire occurred at some as
works.
"There was no military damage of
any sor."
The Zeppelin raid which lasted
from late last night until the early
hours of this morning, did not afford
Londoners the spectacle that did
those of this time la-st year, although
from many parts of the eity people
who were awakened by the firintr,
saw one of the raiders falling in
flames,
I"lIe Await Arrival.
News of the raid circulate! dur
ing the evening and people waited
the arrival. They h;ul almost given
up hope when the tiring of guns told
them that Zeppelins were making
an effort to reach the city. Only a
few rounds were fired, however, a

strong for the raiders, the most dar
