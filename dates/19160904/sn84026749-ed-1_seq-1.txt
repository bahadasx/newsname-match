Address Cheers Greeted
Him on Way South.
By ROBERT J. BENDER.
HODGENVILLE, Ky., Sept. 4.
Abraham Lincoln's birthplace
here a little hut, now preserved
and protected within a shrine of
stone today was added to the
treasures of the United States
Government.
President Wilson received the
deed to the property, together with
an endowment fund of $100,000
for its maintenance, from the Lin
coln Farm Association.
Standing before the historic
cabin, the President spoke of Lin
coln as the embodiment of the va
lidity and vitality of democracy.
"This little hut," the President
said, "was the cradle of one of the
great sons of men, a man of singu
lar, delightful, vital genius, wrio
presently emerged upon the great
stage of the nation's history, gaunt,
shy, ungainly, but dominant and
majestic, a natural ruler of men." .
NOT TYPICAL AMERICAN.
Lincoln waa not a typical American,
ths President said, "because no man
can be typical who la so unusual." But,
he added, "It was typical of American
life that it should produce such men
with supreme Indifference as to the
manner in which It produced thorn."
Twenty-five thousand people, the out
pouring of the countryside for miles
around, bade the President a royal wel
come. The President and Mrs. Wilson arrived
heie at 9:40 this morning. Kn route to
the, Lincoln farm the party stopped at
the court house square, where the Presi
dent placed a wreath on Lincoln's statue
there.
t Mrs. Wilson was presented with a
beautiful bouquet by the school children
of the village.
The party leaves on Its return to
Washington at 2 o'clock, caching the
Capital tomorrow afternoon, t
Text of Address.
The President' address In full fol
low: "No more significant memorial could
hare been presented to the nation
than this. It expresses so much of
what Is singular and noteworthy In
the history of the country; It sug
gents so many of the things that we
prise most highly In our life and In
our system of government. How elo
quent this little house within this
ahrlne la of the vigor of democracy!
"There Is nowhere In the land any
home so remote, so humble, that it
may not contain the power of mind
and heart and conscience to which
nations yield and history submits It
processes. Nature pays no tribute to
aristocracy, subscribes to no creed of
caste, renders fealty to no monarch
or master of any name or kind. Ge
nius Is no snob. It does not run after
titles or seek by preference the high
circles of society. It affects humble
company as well as great.
"It pays no special tribute to uni
versities or learned societies or con
ventional standards of greatness, but
serenely chooses Its own comrades, Its
own haunts, Its own cradle even, and
Its own life of adventure and of
training. Here Is proof of It. This
little hut was the cradle of one of
the great sons of men, a man of sin
gular, delightful, vital genius who

BAFFLES N.Y.P0UCE
Two Suspects Not Identified by
Dead Man's Companion.
Searching Park District.
NEW VOnK, Sept. 4. Baffled after
a night of searching, police today
combed the Vancourtland Park district
for two men who stepped out of the
brush by the side of a lonely road and
shot and killed Dwlght Dllworth, a
lawyer, as he sat In his automobile.
The only story of the murder the po
lice have Is from the lips of Miss Mary
McNIff, a stenographer, who was the
companion of. the murdered man. She
was hysterical and Incoherent when
held by the police for examination early
today.
hirst knowledge of the crime came to
the police when Miss McNIff, breathless
and excited, ran up to two officers some
distance awuy and told them Dllworth
had been held up and shot by two high
waymen. The officers accompanied Miss McNIff
to the scene of the murder and found
the Dllworth car with its wheels cramp
ed across the road and its headlight
streaming over the field. Over the driv
ing wheel hung -the limp body of the
lawyer. On the hands of the lawyer
were valuable rings and In his por
wasa wallet containing a considerable
sum.
At Kings Bridge station house Miss
McNIff told a" slightly different and
more Incoherent story than she had told
to the officers previously.
Dllworth maintains n home In Mont
clalr, but his wife and family are now
visiting In Kansas City. Miss Nc.Nlff. the
police learn, has been a client of Dll
worth and has known him for some
time.
Two suspects were taken bv the po
lice, but Miss N'cNiff was unable to
Identify them and they were released.
Reed Asks Probe of
8-Hour Train Cost
Introduces Resolution in Senate to
Determine Effect of New
Railroad Law.
Senator Reed of Missouri today Intro
duced In tha Senate a resolution di
recting the Interstate Commerce Com
mission tn make an investigation Into
tho increase In cost of operating trains
under tho eight-hour law nnd report
to Congress next December.
The resolution went over under the
rults. Inasmuch as there Is a Joint
commission of Congress wnlch has au
thority to do this and the eight-hour
law will not be effective until January
1 there will be opposition to it.
CLAIM NEW HOUSE
WILL BE SUFFRAGE
Association Is Polling Congresison
al Candidates.
A majority of the Congress to be
elected in November will be In favor
of the Federal suffrage amendment, ac
coidlngio the Congressional committee
of the National American Woman Suf
frage Association, which has sent a
letter to each of the candidates asking
his position on the Federal amendment,
and seeking his support.
While the process of getting the com
plete list of candidates Is slow, it Is
stated, so that only a comparatively
few States have so far been covered, a
total of 132 replies already have been
received. Oie hundred and twelve of
these, or nearly 85 per cent, dealarsd
themselves In favor of woman suffrage,
and stated that they would vote for the
Federal amendment, and would work
to get a favorable report on the amend
ment POTATO PRICES RISE
IN LOCAL MARKETS
Potatoes arc up again today, and are
likely to be high for some time, accord
ing to local commission merchants.
The "Irish llamondn" sail at 13. W a
bushel wholesale Saturday, but now
they are selling at 14. There Is no great
demand for them at that price, how
ever. The market In them Is weak.
Sweet pottatoes also have advanced,
despite the assurance of facilities for
transportation. The low prices Satur
day seemed to have no connection with
the approaching settlement of the
strike, but were because of the large
quantities brought In by farmers wish
ing to take advantage of the high prices
prevailing In local markets.
They brought large supplies In and
disposed of them at tip-top prices. To
day, however, there are few bringing In
surplus quantities and the price has
gone up again.
This Is the theory for the price rise
which well Informed commission mer
chants advance.
MURDER OF LAWYER
10-
HOUR
DAY LABOR
GONE FOREVER
SAY R. I MEN
Attempt to Restore It Year
Henoe Would Mean Strike,
Leaders Assert
WILSON TO SIGN BILL AGAIN
Will Affix Signature Second
Time to Make Legality of
Measure Certain.
A lingering air of warfare still
clung to the railroad brotherhood
headquarters today.
Though reasonably confident the
eight-hour law means a year of
peace on the steam lines, brother
hood men frankly said there will
be a strike if the transportation
chiefs ever try to restore the ten-
hour system.
They thought the railroads might
test the constitutionality of the
measure which President Wilson
signed yesterday; but if the courts
rule it is unconstitutional and then
the lines try to resort to ten hours,
the strike threat will be renewed.
The more optimistic say the
wage commission created by the
eight-hour law will find that the
men's cause is just.
FURTHER AID TO PEACE.
Further, the fact that the brotherhoods
are ready and willing to aid the lines
In getting rate increases, if such arc
nec.esif.ry. le'regarded an a peace, oyer
ture the roads will nol scorn."
Only A. B. Gsrretson, W. S. Carter,
and W. S. Stone, of the brotherhood
heads, remained here today.
W. a. Lee. trainmen's leader, return
ed to Cleveland last night. Jnnt before
leaving, he said:
"I'niaage of the eight-hour bill will
aid not only the organized, but also
the unorganized laborers of this coun
try. It will show the latter what or
ganization can accomplish, and It will
bo the beginning of u universal eight
hour system."
Mar See Signing.
It U likely the three brotherhood
chiefs may wltnosa the serond cere
mony, though they were not Invited
as expected to attend yesterday's
act.
Wilson still retains the four pens
with which he made the measure law.
and after using them tomorrow will
turn them over to the union leaders
an souvenir of the sidetracking of
what threatened to bo America's most
serious Industrial conflict.
Congress went to work today to
clear business other than railroad
legislation. The recommendations of
President Wilson for more laws to
cope with situations such as that Just
passed will go unheeded for this ses
sion. Congress In December may
finish the task.
The proposed compulsory arbitra
tion law will be fought by the
hrnfharhnnrtx In the Ipnt In f"onirre
uind If li should pass then the struggle
rwlll go to the courts.
Says Stolen Maps
Were of No Value
Were to be Made- Public by Gov
, ernment Anyway, Says
Bertholf.
The maps stolen from the Coast
Guard cutter Apache, at Halt I more,
and found In the rooms of Herbert
Sauer, a Coast Guard deserter and
suspected German spy, were declared
valueless by Captain Commandant
IS. P. Bertholf.
"All these maps and charts made by
the Coast Guard officers are pub
lished by the Government," Captain
Bertholf said. "If this man wero a
spy he might have saved himself the
trouble by waiting for the printed
copies."
Captain Bertholf dented a code book
had boen stolen bv the deserter. The
Coast Guard, he said, had no such thing
as a code book.
Bauer waa arrested at Baltimore in
connection with a murder case, The
maps and personal effects of Coast
ouard officers were found in his rooms.
There was no military value In any of
the stolen articles, Captain Bertholf de
clared. Another Infant Plague

PLANNING TO ADJOUR
WEDNESDAY
A resolution calling1 for an adjournment of Congress
at 6 o'clock Wednesday afternoon next was drafted today by
the Democratic floor leader of the House, Congressman
Kltchin of North Carolina.
The resolution will be introduced this afternoon unless
Senate leaders tell Mr. Kltchin that it will be impossible for
the Senate to complete its work by that hour. In any event,
adjournment will not be delayed beyond Thursday, accord
ing to the agreement of House leaders.
Comparatively few House members were at the Capitol
today, and the general expectation is that "get-away" day
will be Wednesday.
Senate Democratic leaders have planned to wind up the
session and adjourn Wednesday evening if possible, but
fear they will not be able to finish until Thursday.
Senators Simmons, Martin and Leader Kitchin, of the
House, talked the matter over this morning. It was decided
that the adjournment resolution would be held back in the
Senate until it was seen what progress could be made in
hurrying things to a close.
Senator Simmons later predicted that if adjournment
could not be brought about Wednesday night it would be
Thursday. Were it not for the delay in the revenue bill it
would be possible to quit Wednesday night.

Thousands Visit Ruins.
Thousands of Londoners continued to
pour out to Cuffley today to see the pile
of debris.
The ntreets and housetops were
cronded while the raid was In progress.
General French's official report at mid
night that a raid waa In progress called
out the London constabulary, and
within a few minutes word that a great
fleet of alrsblp.i had Invaded England
had spread throughout the city.
It was 2 a. m. before the London
crowds got their first thrill. A single
antl-ulrcraft gun suddenly boomed off
somewhere, announcing the arrival of
a Zeppelin. The booming became epi
demic, spreading all over 1-ondon. Sharp
explosions, evidently of bombs hut led
down by the Zeppelins, were heard far
In the distance.
It was an Ideal night for raiding
purposes, black, with but few stars.
The searchlights cut across the black
ness like long white Angers until one
of them plckod up a tiny cigar-shaped
object far off In the heavens.
Booming Inceumt.
The booming now became Incessant.
A whole handful of the searchlight
fingers focused on the Zeppelin, which
swung first one way and then an
other in vain efforts to escape the
glare. Shrapnel burst star-like above
and below the raider. It was like a
great display of fire works.
Suddenly an airship lurched and
pointed Its nose skyward. Apparently
she was trying to mount Into the
clouds. She trembled a moment in
mld-alr, then returned to her hori
zontal position and while the crowds
watched breathlessly, suuaeniy van
ished from sight.
Bursts Into Flame.
The searchlights flashed sharply
seeking to relocate her. Their shafts
fell against a cloud behind which It
seemed the Zeppelin might have
taken refuge. Dut while every eye
was glued on this cloud bank, there
was a burst of (lame several hun
dred feet lower a flame that red
dened half northern London. The
burning mass seemed to hang sus
pended In the air for fully two sec
onds. Then It gradually sank from
sight.
The cheers that went up from the
London streets and house tops com
bined In a great roar.

AFTERNOON
GREECE
YIELDS TO
DEMANDS OF ALLIES
Action Believed to Presage War
Declaration Germans and
Bulgars Invade Roumania.
LONDON. Sept. 4. Greece has ac
cepted all the allies' demands, according
to an official announcement today from
Paris.
Coupled with the reports that King
Conatanttne has announced his intention,
since Roumanla's entrance Into the war,
to reconsider his position, this l be
lieved to presage a decisive step by
Greece.
While Roumanian troops continue their
successful drive Into Transylvania, a
German-Bulgarian army has launched a
terrific drive against the entente's new
ally and has begun-an Invasion of south-
estern Roumania.
. . . ' . . .
having been driven back. This steD evl
dently has been taken In the hope of
cutting off an advance of the, Russians
into uuigana.
Full Co-operation.
A policy of full co-operation by
Greece, with Ihe entente allies under
a coalition cabinet, as a preliminary
to aotlve Intervention, has been de
cided on.
The new plan Involves the indefinite
postponement of the elections and the
continuance of Zalmls as premier,
with the support of Venizelos.
The Greek government has agreed to
demands of Great Britain and France
for full control of the posts and tele
graphs, to prevent Information reaching
their enemies, and to the expulsion of
Baron von Schenk and sixty of his ad
herents who have been working In the
Intereaja of the Teutons.
There are Indications that the allies
will also ask to be allowed to use the
Piraeus as a base for the supplying of
the western wing of the army in the
lialkans, and that this will be per
mitted. Ex-Premier Venizelos has declared
his full confidence in Premier Zalmls,
the only difference hitherto separat
ing them being the latter's Insistence
on holding the elections at this Junc
ture. In such event Venlieloa threat
ened to abstain from the elections.
Demands of Allies.
Representatives at Athens of Great
Britain and France presented to the
Greek government a not which read
as follows:
"By order of their governments the
undersigned ministers of France and
Great Britain have the honpr to bring
the following communication to the
nttentlon of the Greek government:
"First The two allied governments,
having from a sure source learned that
their enemies receive Information In di
vers ways and notably through the
agency ot the Greek telegraphs, demand
the control of the posts and telegraphs,
Inoludlng the wireless system.
"Sccon,d Enemy agents employed In
corruption and espionage must Imme
diately leave Greece, not to return until
the conclusion of hostilities.
"Third Necessary measures have
been taken against such Oreek sub
jects as rendered themselves guilty of
complicity In the above mentioned
corruption and espionage.
The note formed the subject of a
conference between King Constantlne,
Premier Zalmls and Dr. Strelt, a for
mer minister of foreign affairs.

IN COMBLES OUTSKIRTS.
A sweeping advance In terrific fight

of those positions, but were every
where checked.
On tho eastern front, the Russians

tive inactivity are smashing hard at the
Austro-German llns In both eastern
G all da and In the Carpathians.
The Germans are sending all avail
able men to the Roumanian frontier
and Into Bulgaria to stiffen the Bulgar
lines against an expected attack by
tho Greeks. The Germans now believe
that Greece will Join the allies, and

An Exchange Telegrnph dispatch
frcm Athens today said that the Greek
government has accepted uncondition

early policy of neutrality.
Greatest Allied Gain.
The combined French and British
dash on Combles, which carried a
front of nearly six miles, was the
biggest allied success on the Somme
tn many weeks.
Tha allied attack flung back large
German forces and succeeded In
everything that had been hoped for
It. The Germans retired In disorder
and the field was covered with their
dead.
French troops began the attack Just
about noon, after their guns had thun
dered all night and through the
morning, smashing the German
trenches and lines of shell holes.
North of the Somme the French In
fantry Jumped from their trenches
all along a front of nearly four miles,
from the region north ot Maurepas to
the River Somme.
French troops from Maurepas took
the village of Le Forest, directly east
of It. whllo further to tho south the vil
lage ot Clery fell to the French.
Thcie was deadly hand-to-hand light
ing In both villages, where tha Germans
hod made every cellar a fort. Whole
underground cities had been dug. with
passages for streets and dugouts for
houses, but the French took them all.
At the same moment that the
French began their dashing attack,
the British on their left had "gone
over" their trencher and started for
ih German lines.
