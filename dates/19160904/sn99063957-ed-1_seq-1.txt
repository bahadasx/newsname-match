Louisville, Ky., Sept. 4. On Board
President Wilson's special train.) Aft
er a dav and a night of ovations and
demonstrations by crowds led by bauds
that greeted the president's passage
through everv citv and hamlet en route,
Louisville today presented the climax
of greetings when the presidential train
steamed over the bridge and entered the
stntioii here.
Shrieking calliopes on big river excur
sion boats wailed out "3lv uid ion
tucky Home" and patriotic airs.
Crowds gathered at every vantage
point in the hope of seeing the chief
executive.- in cheering at tne station
developed into a deafening roar as the
train finally came to a stop. It con
tinued intermittently . as the special
waited for an hour while three excursion
trnin-s, bound for Hodgenville, got away
loaded to the guards.
Despite the uoise, the president did
not rise until just before his train pull
ed awnv from Louisville station,
is Given Great Ovation.
On board the special were Senutor
John Sharp WiIlHims.. senator nvm
lands and Robert Collier, vice-president
of the Lincoln Farm association, who
will take a leading part in presenting
to the United States the old log cabin
in which the great emancipator was
bom. Joseph Folk, ex-governor of Mis
souri, ono of the day's speakers, also
was a member of the presidential
party.
Virginians, West Virginians and Ken
tuekians have vied with each other in
according the president an enthusiastic
reception on his-first extended trip
since his, renomination by the demo
cratic party.
The president Remained np late last
night to shake hnnds with thousands
who gathered about his private car at
every station. He retired about 11
o'clock, however, being too tired tr
respond to the call of a crowd of 5,000
who were headed by a brass band at
Huntington, W. Va. -
Two brass bands and several thousand
persons awoke him with their music and
cheering as the train passed through
Ashland, Ky., at midnight.
. Every hamlet and eity through which
the train passed turned out en masse re
gardless of the hour, during the entire
trip here. The private car looked like
a conservatory today when it pulled into
Louisville with flowers, presented to
Mrs. Wilson in every window.
A Sacred Spot.
Hodgenville, Ky., Sept. 4. Abraham
Lincoln's birthplace here, a little hut
now preserved and protected within a
shrine ot stone today was added to
the treasures ot the government of the
United States. President Wilson re
ceived the deed to the property, togeth
er with an endowment fund of $100,000
for its maintenance from the Lincoln
Farm association. Standing before the
historic cabin, the president spoke of
Lincoln as the embodiment ot tne va
lidity and vitality of democracy.
"This little hut," the president said,
"was the cradle of one of the great
est soiiss of man, a man of singular, de
lightful, vital genius, who presently em
erged upon the great stage of the na
tion's history, gaunt, ungainly but dom
inant and majestic, a natural ruler of
men. " .
Lincoln was not a typical American,
the president said, because no man can
be typical who is so unusual.
"But," be added, "it was typical of
American life that it should produce
such men with supreme indifference ns
to the manner in which it produced
them."
The president and Mrs. Wilsou ar
rived here at 9:40 this morning.- En
route to the Lincoln farm the party
stopped at the court house square,
where the president placed a wreath on
Lincoln's statue there. Mrs. Wilson
was presented with a beautiful bouquet
by the school children of the village.
The party leaves on its return trip to
Washington at 2 o'clock, reaching the
capital tomorrow afternoon.
The President's Address.
"No more significant memorial

LABOR LEADERS SAY II
MEANS YEAR OF PEACE
Think Investigation Will Sifbw
Men's Demands Are Rea
sonable and Just
By Carl D. Groat,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, Sept. 4. A lingering
year of warfare still clung to the rail
road brotherhoods today. Though rea
sonably confident the eight hour bill,
now a low, means a year of peace on
the rail lines, brotherhood men frank
ly said there will be a strike if tho
transportation chiefs ever try to re
store the ten hour system.
They thought the railronds may test
the constitutionality of the measure
which President Wilson signed yester
day; but if the courts deem it uncon
stitutional and then the lines try to
revert to ten hours, the strike threat
will bo renewed.
The moro optimistic say the wage
commission created by the eight hour
law will find that the men's cause is
just. In this event, they say the rail
roads are seercely likely to overturn
the law, constitutional or unconstitu
tional. Further, the fact that the
brotherhoods aro ready and willing to
aid the lines in getting rate increases,
if such are necessary, is regarded as a
peace overture the railroads will not
scorn.
Only A. B. Cnrretson, W. 8. Carter
and W. 8. Stone of the brotherhood
heads remained here today.
W. G. Lee, trainmen leader, returned
to Cleveland last night. To the United
Press ho said:
"Passage of the eight hour bill will
aid not only the organized but also the
unorganized laborers of this country.
It will show the latter what organiza
tion can accomplish and it will be the
beginning of a universal eight hour
system."
' In view of the fact that some per
sons have questioned the legality of a
bill signed on Sunday, President Wilson
will again sign the document tomorrow.
Congress Perfects Bill.
Washington, Sept. 4. The senate
and bouse celebrated Labor Day by
completing the workmen's compensa
tion law affecting between 400,000 and
500,000 government employes.
The president will sign the bill on
his return to Washington tomorrow.
The senate nnd house spent less than
ten seconds agreeing to the conference

Washington, Sept. 4. Senator Reed
today introduced a resolution directing
the interstate commerce commission to

MURDERED HIS WIFE
"TOSAVEHER PURITY"
Murderer Is Caught But Leaps'
From Tram and May Die
From Injuries
Chicago, Sept. 4. 'I killed her be
cause I wanted to save her purity,"
was J. Maurice Tettit's explanation to
polico toduy for the murder of his
beautiful twenty year old bride of a
month. Pettit was nrrested Saturday
afternoon near Detroit, Michigan, and
brought back here yesterday. Ho is
now a closely guarded patient at the
Bridewell hospital as a result of a des
perate attempt to escape from a train
en route here. He dived through a
window of a coach near Michigan City,
Indiana. The speed of the train caused
him to strike the ground with terrific
force and ho lay where he- fell until
detectives eaine back and got him.
"She still lives as you and I do,"
Pettit told the police. ' When 1 killed
her I did it materially, not spiritually.
''Other men called at the flat and
talked to her," said Pettit. 1 was
jealous of her. I was .wrong' in that.
She was always good and pure."
Pettit was captured at a farmhouse
near Detroit. A farmer recognized
him from a newspaper photograph.
When arrested he admitted he killed
his wife, police say.
Pettit's condition was still considered
serious todav. He suffered two punc
tures of the left lung from the ejids of
broken ribs when he attempted to
escape. Pettit was formerly a bunk
teller at Cellar Rapids, Iewa.

UNITED STATES
In view of the trouble among the
railroad men and among traction men
in- New York, the biggest city in the
country, and in other places, the Labor
day demonstrations scheduled for this
year assumed additional importance
and interest. . Parades; were planned
for mnny cities. Labor leaders deplore
the tendency - to devote the day, the
last holiday of the slimmer season, en
tirely to outdoor sports nnd are en
deavoring to educate the public to a
recognition of the real and original
meaning of the day. Labor day is now
a legal holiday in all the fortv-eight
states of the Union and in all of the
territories. Tho holiday is now about
thirty years old. Pictures show seeues
in past Labor day parades in which
men, women and children participated.
Spectators frequently comment on the
fact that Labor day parades show
many traces of recent foreign origin.
KILLING OF LAWYER
Hysterical Woman Tells Con
flicting Stories About His
Being Shot by Robber
New York, Sept. 4. Balked after a
night of searching, police todav comb
ed the Van Cortland Park district for
two men who, it is claimed, stepped out
of the brush by the side of a lonely
road and shot and killed Dwight Ihi
worth, a lawyer, as he sat in his
automobile. -X t t
The only story of the murder the
police have is from the lips of Miss
Mary McNiff, a stenographer, who was
the companion of the murdered man.
She was hysterical and incoherent when
held by tho polico for examination
earlv todav.
First knowledge of the crime came
to the police when Miss McNiff,
breathless and excited ran to officers
some distance away and told them Dil
worth had been held up and shot by
two highway men.
Tho officers accompanied Miss Mc
Niff to the scene of the murder and
found the auto with its wheels cramped
across the road and its headlight
streaming over the field. Over the
driving wheel hung the limp body of
the man. (hi the hands of the lawyer
were valuable rings and in his pocket
was a wallet containing a considerable
sum. At King's Bridge station house
Miss NcNiff told a slightly different
and more incoherent story than that
she had told tho officers previously.
Dilworth maintains a home in Mont
clair, but his wife and family are now
visiting in Knnsas City. Miss McNiff,
the police learn, has been a client of
Dilworth and has known him for some
time.
Two suspects have been held by the
polico but Miss McNiff was unable to
identify them and they were released.

London, Sept. 4. Eighteen charred
and crushed corpses, the bodies of tha
German Zeppelin sailors who cams
crashing to earth from a mile abov
London in Sunday morning's ; reat raid
were burled near Cuffley today
: They were the first Germans to die
in action on English soil since the war
began. One of them wore on irom
cross. ',' .
Experts attached to the royal flying
corps today continued to . dig in th
ruins of the destroyed Zeppelin for bitt
of machinery that will assist them in
reconstructing a dirigible. . '
Much of the machinery was found
only slightly damaged. The Zeppelin
clock was practically as good as new.
It had stopped at 8:10, the hour whett
an English shell went bursting through ;
the great bag. . . ' '-
Thousands of Londoners continued to
pour out to Cuffley today to see the pile)
of debris they had watched tumble front
the sky Sunday morning.
The streets and housetops were)
crowded while the raid was in progress.
General French's official report at
midnight that a raid wns in progress,
called out the London constabulary and
within a few mlnntcs word that a great
fleet oJ airships had invaded England
had spread throughout the city.
It was 2 a. m. before the Londom
crowds got their first thrill. A single
anti-aircraft gun suddenly boomed,
somewhere, announcing the arrival of s
Zeppelin. Tho booming became epi
demic, spreading all over London. Sharp
explosions, evidently of bombs hurled
down by the Zeppelins, were heard fa
in the distance.
A Thrilling Scene.
It was an ideal night for raiding
purposes, black with but with few stars.
The searchlights cut across the black
ness like loag white fingors until one
of them picked up a tiny cigar shaped
object far off in the heavens.
The booming now became incessant.
A whole handful of searchlight fingera
focused on the Zeppelin which swung
firBt one way and then another in vain
efforts to escape the glare. Shrapnel
burst star-Jike above and below the raid
er. It was like a great display of fire
works. Suddenly tho airship lurched
ami pointed its nose skyward. Appar
ently she was trying to mount into tht
clouds. She trembled a moment in mid
air, then returned to her horizontal po
sition and while the crowds watched
breathlessly suddenly vanishod from
sight.
The searchlights flashed sharply
BAckincr to re locate her. Their shafts
fell against a cloud behind which it
seemed the Zeppelin might have taken
refuge. But while every eye was glued
on this cloud bank, there was a burst
of flame several hundred feet lower!
a flame that reddened half northern
London. Tho burning mass seemed to
hang suspended in the air for fully two
sections. Then it gradually sank from
sight.
The cheers that went up from tht)
London streets and house tops combined
in a great roar and out did the yells of
all the worlds series baseball crowd
that ever cssemblcd. Women withi
coats thrown over their nightgowns,
barefooted men, some of them wearing;
only their pajamas, waved their arma
and yelled. ,
The booming of anti-aircraft guns be
came less frequent and then died out
altogether. The driver of a street
sweeper yelled "Get up" to his horse
and his broom recommenced revolving.
London yawned aod went back, to bed, -
