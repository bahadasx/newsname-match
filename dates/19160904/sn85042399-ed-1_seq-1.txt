Auspicious Opening of
Ashland Public Schools
Ashland was astir early this morn
ing. Good reason why, everybody
had lmporatnt business on hand. The
public school bells rang out lor the
first time In three months. The
mothers hustled around to wash
Johnny's ears and braid Mary's
tousled locks In time to land them
at the school house steps by 8:43.
All who paw the merry and expectant
faces on their way to the various
seats of learning with the enthusiasm
and vigor of youth must be bound to
declare that the old worn out tale
about school days being hard days is
all a myth.
The Ashland public schools are
open for the fall term. Superintend

full complement of teachers, 33 In
number, whose names appeared in
the Tidings last Monday and of whom
seven are new to the Ashland schools,
are entering upon what promises to
lie one of the most successful years
In the educational history of Ash
land.
The schools are housed in three
substantial and modern buildings,
cuts of which appear on the first page
of the Tidings today.
High School.
The high school building is located
at the northwest corner of Mountain
avenue and Iowa street on six acres
of ground. There are
26 rooms in the build
ing besides the audi
torium, with a seating
capacity of 300, and a
gymnasium of the
same size and well
equipped with appa
ratus of various sorts.
This is the newest of
the three buildings,
completed in 1912, and
In it is used the Ple
num combined system
o f ventilating and
Tieatlng. The fresh
cold air enters through

windows in the base
ment, being drawn in
a strong draft by
recolving fan perhaps
or more in diameter.
a swiftly
five feet
On the in-
side of the circumference of the fan
wheel are sixty blades projecting to
ward the axle of the wheel which
revolves the same as a vehicle wheel.
This fan wheel forces the air through
a large iron conveyor directly over
the four oil-burning furnaces, where
the air is heated and carried directly
to the rooms through galvanized
pipes. Each room is supplied with a
thermostat which acts automatically
and keeps the air at the desired tem
perature. The air is forced in at
one end of the room and finds sev
eral exits. The system also provides
for the use of cold air along with
the air from over the furnaces and
is so arranged and operated that
every room is supplied with entirely
fresh air every three minutes.
A Standard electric time clock Is
used to ring all class bells both in
Bide and outside the building. It is
get once In the fall for the entire
school year and ,acts automatically.
The recitation rooms are furnished
with arm chairs and a teachers'
library cabinet. The right wing of
the building downstairs is used en
tirely for the science department. It
is equipped with the Bausch & Lomb
projecting system for illustrating on
the screen everything from maps to
microscopic organisms. The opaque
projection is used for post cards,
maps and book illustrations. The
microscopic and lantern slide projec
tions are for bacteriological, biolog
ical and botanical work. For illus
trations of chemical reactions the
Tertical projection Is provided. The
Illustrations are thrown upon a
acreen about ten feet square, thus
showing some of , the subjects in
wonderfully magnified proportions.
Many of the slides used In the ma
chine are made by the teachers and
students and are retained by the
school for repeated use. The main
floor of the right wing of the build
ing is used for commercial subjects,
music and art.
One floor or the left wing is used
for manual training and mechanical
drawing, and a portion of the upper
floor for cooking and sewing classes.
West School or Junior High.
This building was erected In 1907
on the west side of North Main street
and has for grounds from one and
onet-half to two acres. There are
fourteen rooms, auditorium and

basement. A wood-burning furnace
supplies steam heat to all the rooms.
There is complete equipment for
manual training, sewing and cooking.
The Junior high school, including the
seventh, eighth and ninth grades, is
lust beine organized and will be ac-
1 comraodated in this building in addi
tion to the first six grammar grades
from the west side of the city.
; Kast Side School.
This Is also a substantial brick
building put up iri 1900. It fronts
on Siskiyou Boulevard and has eight
rooms and basement. Three acres of
land provide ample playgrounds for

the children. The first six grammar
grades from the east side of the city
are taken care of in this building. It
is heated by a hot air gravity system
with a wood-burning furnace.
General Conditions.
On each school ground is a tennis
court, a basket-ball court, a volley
ball court and provision for indoor
baseball games. The policy of the
school board is against providing
elaborate equipment for outdoor ex
ercises, but organized games are en
couraged and a physical director de
votes a part of each day to the pupils
at each building in
teaching them the
best games and
helping them to
play Intelligently.
Instead of the old
form of recess each
class leaves the
room some time
during the day for
callsthenlc work,
and the last ten
minutes of the per
iod is for organized
games. In bad
weather the base
.
ments are used.
The tendency all
the time is toward lengthening the
school day and the school year, i The
high school has a Bix-hour day and
the other grades, except the first and
second, have five and three-quarter
hours. The school hours are from
8:45 a. m. to 11:45 a. m., 2 p. m. to
3:45 for the third to sixth grades
and to 4 for the higher grades. Af.
ter the close of school each day one
hour Is given over to a playtime un
der the direction of a teacher. All
pupils are gladly kept on the grounds
Auto Camp Host
To 1,500 Tourists
Over 1,470 automobile tourists
have registered in the free auto
camp ground at Ashland during the
period from May 10 to August 31.
Many using the grounds have not
registered, and it is conservatively
estimated that not less than 2,000
persons from many parts of the
United States have spent one or
more nights at the camp grounds
this summer, many staying several
days
This camp is believed to be the
first one ever established in the
United States for the free and exclu
sive use of automobile tourists. Dur
ing the summer it has proved to be
one of the most attractive spots on
the Pacific coast to travelers from
many places, and from far and near
have come praises for the great com
fort it has brought to travel-stained
sojourners. Among the localities
from which the visitors have regis
tered are Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, In
diana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Min
nesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada,
New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Okla
homa, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washing
ton, Manila, P. I., and Peking, China.
These grounds are situated on the
bank of Ashland creek among the
trees and flowers in Lithla park.
about ton minutes walk from the
Ashland postoffice. Ample space is
provided for the parking of automo
biles, a fresh cold water spring
gushes out of the rock encasement
clase at hand, and a kitchen provided
with gas plates and a locker for each
plate stands among the trees at one
side of the grounds. Through 25
cent slot meters the gas Is furnished
to the plates, and there is no other
charge of any sort to all automobile
travelers who care to use the
grounds, the waters (fresh and min
eral) and all the privileges of the
parks.
Everybody Come
To Club Meeting
The Commercial Club will hold a
meeting tonight at 8 o'clock in their
rooms. All members are strongly
urged to be present and help start
things off with a good boost for the
fall campaign. All men of the city
are invited to attend. Your pres
ence and your ideas will be valuable.
The cattle industry of Oregon has
declined 9 per cent since 1909 and
the sheep industry 11 per cent In the
same time, says the Department of
Agriculture.
during this hour if the parents wish
it, otherwise the children are sent
home as soon as school is out. At
the end of the hour all school work
for the day is over and the children
are not wanted on the grounds.
The school grounds of all three of
the buildings have beautiful, well
kept lawns, shade trees, vines and
bushes of many varieties. The West
school building stands on the approxr
imate site of the old Ashland Acad
emy, where school was first conduct
ed fourty-four years ago. In the
same old frame building the high
school was housed for a number of
years beginning in the early nineties.
The present building is particularly
beautiful with Its wealth of vines
which have clambered rapidly to
high places on the wals.

East Side School.
Ashland is rightly proud of her
school system, which has a high
standing among the public schools of
the state. The children who now
have the opportunity to enjoy the
beauties of their surroundings and
the thorough instruction from com
petent teachers are fortunate Indeed.
Their parents are equally fortunate
and are no doubt able to place the
true value upon the advantages of
living In an enlightened, intellectual
and progressive community.

City Makes Money
In Lithia Park
How many people In Ashland real
ize that $509.35 has been taken In
by the cup-vending machines in pen
nies and nickels in the last five
mouths and four days ending August
31? This happens to be the case,
and It has left the city handsome
profit over the original cost of the
vendors. For that matter, the net
profit has paid for five months serv
ices of a man at $39 per month for
cleaning up and other work connect
ed with the fountains.
This is one of the many ideas of
the springs water commission, which
should be installed to make the park
and water system self-sustaining,
but the lack of funds for initial In
vestments has hampered the commis
sion to carry out their Ideas further
than the installation of the cup vend
ors. The following is an account of the
receipts and expenditures of the cup
vendors. The cups on hand have not
been taken Into consideration, and,
if they were, it would show a still
greater profit-

Distinguished Party
At Hotel Austin
Stephen T. Mather, assistant to the
secretary of the interior of the Unit
ed States; E. O. McCormick of San
Francisco, vice-president of the
Southern Pacific; John M. Scott of
Portland, general passenger agent of
the Southern Pacific for Oregon; Mr.
and Mrs. F. Harold White and Roger
and Ferris White of Chicago made
up a party registered at the Hotel
Austin last Friday. Secretary Math
er Is in Oregon making an inspection
of Crater Lake national park.
During the stay of the party in
Ashland Mr. E. O. McCormick is
showing the secretary over the Ash
land parks. Friday afternoon B. R.
Greer took the party by atuomoblle
to Long's cabin in Ashland Creek
canyon to give the distinguished vis
itor an opportunity to see what the
government has here. Secretary
Mather was delighted and expressed
himself with almost unbounded en
thusiasm regarding the beauty and
utility of Ashland's parks and the
Ashland creek watershed. He ex
claimed: "Why, I expect to see a
city of 25,000 population here with
in five years. You have laid the
foundation for it and will surely see
the realization of your hopes if the
proper publicity, is given to the en
terprise and the work is constantly
followed up in an energetic way and
with intelligent planning. The en
vironment is wonderful and the op
portunity exceptional to build a
beautiful city which will attract the
best people from all over the counr
try."
Last fall Secretary Mather sent to
Ashland for a diagram of the parks
here. These were sent him, and at
a speech In Yellowstone park recent
ly he told of the Ashland automobile
camp grounds. In this speech Ash
land was the only city west of the
Rocky 'mountains which was men
tioned. . Before the senate commit
tee Secretary Mather argued the na
tional park and aid bill which was
signed by President Wilson on Fri
day, August 25.
The largest hotel in Portland
the Multnomah is reported to have
been sold to eastern people for some
thing like one million dollars. It
is said to have cost two million when
built In 1912. About February 1,
last, the hotel failed and closed its
doors and has not been open to the
public since. It is an Immense struc
ture, covering a whole block. As
soon as arrangements can be made
the hotel will be reopened.
Railroad Strike Averted
By Congressional Enactment
The great railroad strike threat
ening to tie up the roads all over the
United States and stop car- wheels
to an extent never before known in
this country has very happily been
averted.
The passage of the eight-hour day
by congress solved the tmmedlate
difficulties, and three hours after
the bill was through the upper house
the heads of the employes' brother
hoods of four great railroads
throughout the country notified their
general chairmen to cancel the order
to strike, Vhlch otherwise would
have gone into effect at 7 o'clock
this morning.
The vote in the senate on the leg
islative enactment to prevent the
strike was 43 to 28, practically on
strict party lines, and was taken
during exciting moments. Many
representatives of both the leading
political parties fought hard to in
sert amendments to the 'bill, which
were framed to prevent future indus
trial disturbances, but these efforts
were unsuccessful. But a few min
utes elapsed in both houses, follow
ing passage by the senate, before en
actment was signed and it went at
once to the White House.
The measure that was successful
In averting the strike provides that
after January 1. next, eight hours
shall be the basis upon which a
day's pay shall be calculated for em
ployes of railroad trains engaged in
interstate commerce, except roads
Lake of the Woods
Lots for Campers
Will Dodge, wljo has just returned
from a trip to Lake of the Woods
and beyond, states that at the south
ern end of the lake, adjoining the
old camping grounds, the govern
ment has completed the survey of
ten lots, each 75 by 205 feet, to-be
leased to campers. The lots are
I leased from year to year at an an
nual rental of $5 each, and each oc
cupant has the first chance to release
for each succeeding year. About
half of the lots are already taken.
It Is understood that when these are
all spoken for additional lots will be
j surveyed. Coleman and Reams of
I Phoenix have a special concession lot
1 150 by 265 feet on which they will
' put up tents with" floors for campers
next year. They expect also' to have
boats on the lake for rent to camp
ers next year. There have been fine
rainbow trout caught in the lake this
year. The Lane or tne woods prom
ises to become one of tho most popi
ular summer resorts for campers in
southern Oregon.
Professional Artist
In Lithia Park
Messrs. M. D. and C. H. Lelsser of
Pittsburg, Pa , are in Ashland for an
indefinite, stay. The former is a
professional artist and was found in
Lithla park by a Tidings reporter.
He was comfortably seated In front
of his easel with many colors spread
out up his palette. A picture of the
creek was taking form and gave test
imony that Mr. Leisser is, indeed, a
professional and understands his
business. The gentlemen are broth
ers. Mr. C. H. Lelsser is a mu
sician and paints as a diversion, call
ing himself an amateur.
In January, 1915, the brothers
started west, Intending to make a
tour of the world, but the great war
upset their plans, so they are spend
ing a year or two on and near the
western hemisphere In studying and
having a , delightful time. They
came west via New Orleans to San
Diego, thence to San Francisco, visit
ing the exposition. From here they
embarked for Honolulu and spent
six months on the Hawaiian Islands.
Next they came by a Canadian line
to Victoria, B. C, and are now work
ing south along the coast. Mr. M
D. Lelsser lived and studied for ten
years in France and Germany, and
says that upon seeing the Olympian
mountain range in Washington it re
minded him much of the scenery In
the Swiss and Bavarian Alps. The
atmospheric effects are much the
same, also, but of course the moun
tain proportions are much larger.
The McCla'len hotel at Roseburg

less than 100 miles long and electric
lines. Pay for work over eight hours)
shall be on a pro rata basis, and the
rate of pay shall not be changed tot,
from six to nine months, during an
investigation of the effect of thai
eight-hour day upon the railroads.
The effects of a strike of these!
proportions were dwelt upon at
length in papers throughout the!
land. Many Instances were cited to
show the far-reaching effects of so)
stupendous a labor disturbance, and
no doubt numerous results which
would soon be apparent were over
looked in the prognostications of
those attempting to forecast the dif
ficulties which might arise.
Many passenger trains were crowd
ed during the last hours preceding
the hour for the strike to take ef
fect, and shipping bills Issued by tha
railroads were marked "subject to
indefinite" delay, or words to tli Is
effect. The railroad offices along
the line had also issued warnings to
travelers that all not reaching their
destinations by Sunday night would
be subject to delay.
The happy endign of so great a
matter is cause for universal con
gratulation throughout the land.
Probably the greatest suffering
which would be caused by such a.
strike would bo among the people of
the cities, who are most quickly af
fected by disturbances In transporta
tion. However, those of the small
towns are thankful for the outcome,
as well.
