SAWiMPERS
He Upholds the Justice of the
Eight-Hour Demands of
Railroad Men.
Lewiston, Me., Sept. 4. In a Labor
day address here, Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, praised President Wilson's
administration for its achievement in
the interest of the labor movement
and denounced the decisions of the
1 supreme court in the Danbury hatters
and Arizona anti-alien law cases,
which he pointed out were participa
ted in by Charles E. Hughes, the Re
publican presidential nominee.
In lengthy discussion of the threat
ened railroad strike, he defended tho
attitude of the brotherhoods ind
while he praised President Wilson for
his efforts to settle the controversy,
he unequallfiedly denounced any at
tempt at legislation to compel arbi
tration. "The demand of the railroad
brotherhoods is a clear cut issue," said
he. "They now make the simple de
mand that their physical well being
shall be protected and that they shall
1 be required to work only such a rea
sonable period of time as industrial
experience has shown to the expe
dient. For the eight-hour principle
has been universally accepted by so
ciety. The eight-hour workman is a
better, a more resourceful, a more
productive worker than the one who
labors long hours.
"The railroad brotherhoods have not
refused to accept arbitration. They
havo declared that the eight-hour
work day involves a principle of hu
man welfare that cannot be disputed
and therefore cannot be arbitrated.
They are willing to submit every other
issue, all of which are arbitratable to
a mutual satisfactory tribunal.
"The railroad men presented their
demands and made their fight in a
simple, direct manner. They have re
lied entirely upon their economic or
ganization. They have not sought any
special privilege, any legal protection,
or endeavored to utilize any govern
mental agency to establish their just
demands. They have secured atten.
tion and won favor to their cause be
cause back of their contentions was
an organization that represented pow
er and service.
"Compulsory arbitration or so-called
investigation is simply a way to re
strain free action on the part of tho
wage earners and to make them more
dominated by employers. It only
makes the striker a criminal and gives
authority for jailing workers who quit
Work.
"Employers appreciate the impor
tance of the shorter work day; they
know that it means more independent
workmen; workmen not so readily
held in submission. It is necessary
for the protection and the best inter
ests of the workers to whom the law
will lmplify as well as to all workers
of the state, that every man shall do
his best; that every woman in Maine
shall aid to secure the approval of this
act."

HUGHES REFUSES
TO BEJRESENT
Declines Invitation to Attend
Labor Day Celebration in
Nashville.
Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 4. Charles
E. Hughes today declined to attend
the Labor day celebration, as ar
ranged for by a local committee, when
he was advised that he would not be
permitted to speak except on non
politlcal subjects. Mr. Hughes also
declined to review the Tennessee Na
tional Guard, saying that he had no
right to do so.
No formal invitation had been ex
tended by local labor unions in
charge of the Labor day celebration
to Mr. Hughes, but the committee in
charge of the nominee's program ad
vised it "that it would be all right"
for him to attend. Announcement
had been made by this committee
that Mr. Hughes would be present.
When Charles W. Farnham, man
ager of the Hughes tour, conferred
with the local Hughes' committee, he
was told that Governor Rye, of Ten
nessee, Democrat, and other speakers
would address the meeting. Mr.
Farnham was -told that some of tho
speakers probably would endorse the
enactment of the Adamson bill. He
replied that Mr. Hughes would attend
the celebration, if he would be per
mitted to speak. The committee ad
vised him that labor leaders in
charge of the program had decided
that Mr. Hughes would not be per
mitted to talk on subjects of a politi
cal nature.
Arrangements for the nominee at
tending the convention were then
cancelled.

SUBMARINER
Nets Laid in Greek Harbor and
Subsea Boat Brought to
Surface.
London, Monday, Sept, 4. The
Daily Chronicle prints a dispatch 'from
Athens asserting that King Constan
tino is understood to have expressed
himself in favor of Greece abandon
ing her neutrality in favor of the
allies.
The Times also prints a dispatch
from Athens saying that King Con
stantino has expressed himself in
favor of a reconsideration of Greece's
policy. His decision, It is stated, Is
due to the entrance of Rumania into
the war.
London, Sept. 3. The ontente is
acting with a strong hand in Greece.
And, under the directing influence of
tho allied diplomatists and military
commanders, order already is emerg
ing from the choas of the last few
weeks.
Among the stern measures taken by
the allied ministers at Athens the fol
lowing became known today through
censored dispatches:
1. A demand has ben presented to
the Greek government that the opera
tion of the Greek mails and telegraphs
must be placed in the hands of the
entente.
2. The diplomatic and other repre
sentatives of the central empires and
their allies must be expelled from
Greece.
3. The harbor of Piraeus has been
practically taken over by the allied
fleet The wireless station, the only
means by which Greece can communi
cate with the outside world, has been
seized by a landing force from the
warships. The harbor was dragged
and submarine nets laid, with the
result that a German submarine was
captured. It is believed this undersea
boat received suDplIes of oil and am
munition from the Interned German
liners seized ypsterday.
4. It is probable that the entente
will take over Piraeus as a small base.
From the port food will he distributed
by rail to the western wing armies
on the front in Macedonia.
Piraeus to Become Bass.
5. In their campaign of expulsion
a number of Germans and Austrian
agents in Athens already have been
arrested, it is reported. Baron von
Schenk. the German publicity agent,
Is in hiding.
As a result of these measures. It Is
reported from Athens, the Greek gov
ernment and the Venlzelists arq near
ing a compromise by which the future
attitude of the nation will soon he
decided. It Is expected that the pres
ent premier, Alexander Zaimls, will re
tain his portfolio, several prominent
Venlzelists entering his cabinet
It is expected tlmt the proposed
"lections, which Venlzolos has opposed
all along, threatening that his party
would abstain from participation if
the elections were forced, will be In
definitely postpone. Former Premier
Venizelos Is reported vesterday in a
dispatch from Athens "to have an
nounced his support of tho Zaimls
ministry as reconstructed bv (ho ap
pointment of M. Ropoulls and General
Danglls to Important portfolios.
It Is not oxpsotod that as a result
of these developments Greece will
enter the war. but that an attitude of
benovolent neutrality toward tho en
l tento powers will bo scrupuously ob-
served, tho allies being granted all
rights and liberty of action of Greek
territory.
' Will Not Oppose Demand.
The Greek government is expected
lo offer no opposition to the demand
of the entente that control of the malls
and telepragh wires bo vested in their
hands. These demands were based on
the fact that the central empires were
obtaining information of a vital char
acter, such as troop movements,
through the agency of the Greek wire
systems. The note setting forth the
allies' position was delivered by the
French and British ministers at
Athens.
A wave of pro-ally sentiment is re
ported to be sweeping Greece and Brit-'
ish correspondents express the belief
that, owing to the stern measures tak
en after quibbling of more than a year,
the Greek situation will soon be satis
factorily settled.
