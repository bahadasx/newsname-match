SIAIh IIIIAHIJ Or HEALTH FIIIDS FAULT WITH
EFFLUENT OF
In a report received today by Mayor
Robertson the State Board of Health
finds that a proper provision for dis
posing of the raw effluent from the
Imhoff tanks of the new sewerage
system has not been made. The board
recommends that further treatment
beds be installed. The mayor has not
signed the plumbing ordinance, re
cently passed by council, pending con
sideration of the recommendations of
the State Board of Health. The re
port has. been filed with City Clerk
Sistrunk, and will doubtless be con
sidered by council at its meeting to
morrow night. , ' , .
George W. Simons Jr., chief, of
the bureau of engineering of the
State Board of Health, prepared the
report. He commends the sewerage
systTem .generally, and commends the
construction of the two Imhoff tanks.
He calls attention to the sixty to!
sixty-five sewerage wells in the city,
One, at the Ocala House, has been in
use for twenty-two years. These
wells, the report says, should be clos
ed as soon as the new sewerage sys
tern is put in operation.
Referring to the disposal of the
seweraSe at the Imhoff tanks, the re
Port says; "According to genera
M30 as shown the necessary space
I Vj3 B1IUWCU
for final treatment or
contact bed, but in the actual con
struction the final beds were -omitted
and the raw effluent from the tanks
will be jallowed to flow into a .deep
10"in?h welL lt is strongly reborn
mended by . this board that the orig
inal plan be adhered to and the fur
tleT treatment be be installed pre
vious to the opening xf -the plant.
Moreover the effluent should be sub-
j.ectfd to a thorough disinfection with
liquid chlorine or hypochlorate of
lime before it is allowed access to a
deep well.1
Evidence is presented in the report
to show that the Imhoff tank is not a
final means of sewerage disposal. The
effluent coming from the tank must
be given further treatment before it
is allowed to flow into the deep well.
"The discharge of effluent into
deep well," says the report, "means
the contamination of underground
water, perchance with disease produc-
inS germs."
Mr. David Henney, of Twombly &
nenney, engineers lor tne city in
I rbnrcrp nf fh spwpracA svst.PTn. after
the J. B. McCrarv comnanv was re
mo vaH from the work, said that it
was supposed that the McCrary com
pany had obtained a permit from the
board of health for the discharge into
th in-i well Mr. Hphtipv Ra?H
that the installation of the treatment
by
board would not be expensive.
The Board of Health's report takes
up Ocala's water supply. It says that
Ocala has an adequate supply of pro
table water, and that never in the his
tory of the city has any disease been
traced to the water supply. It sug-
age.
The report says: "The supply- of
water for Ocala is ample but unfor-
tunately is located in the midst of
numerous sewerage wells draining
into the underground water bearinsr
formation, and one cannot predict
when a - serious contamination may
result. The water is being served
untreated and up to. this time no dis-
ease bas ever been traced to this
source."
The report points out that surface
prmes are numerous m the city,
especially in the negro sections, ana
says: "Steps shouia oe taKen immea
lately to demand the construction of
sanitary screened privies, which are
fly-proof, and thus eliminate this
serious source of danger."
