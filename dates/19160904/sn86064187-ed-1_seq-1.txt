RAILROAD STOCK
TO BE GIVEN FOR
BONUSES PUT UP
Concrete Piopositinn by Pro
moter of Northwest Line,
Harem r Walters, promoter of the
proposed northwest railroad out of
Oklahoma City, issued a concrete
proposition 'this morning ''in which he
offered to exchange stork in the litie
equal to the amount of bonus put up.
He further stated that every dollar of
bonus would go into construction of
road .He went into the details of
'1 fie promotion woik, and referred, to
reports ett other proposals to build
such a line, as follow s :
. "I am satisfied, after careful inves
ligation, that ihere is only our real
proposition before the people of Okla
homa City today, and that the talk of
other money available for this purpose
is only an effort to block the construc
tion of the line Monev for the com

Already this money has been tied up
for about a mon'h and a half.
Towns Helping Splendidly
"Towns along the line, outside of
Oklahoma City, have gone about this
matter in a businesslike way, and each
has ,stated what it ran do in the wav
of a bonus and right-nf-wav. But
while every ritizen of Oklahoma Citv
seerg to he favorably inclined and de
sires the construction of the road, it
seem impossible to Ret any definite
action or a definite statement as to
what Oklahoma Citv and its business
interests will do. Oklahoma City would
be benefited quite as, much ,as arty
section along the line
To Cost 12,000,000.
"A competent engineer has made a
thorough examination of the line with
estimates of cost and income and das
satisfied the hanker that the railroad
ran be constructed for $2000 001. The
question a to the cost of material is
not of importance to the people, as the
banker under hi contract will agree
to construct and equip the line com
plete even though the actual cost i
greater than $4000000. The fmtire
bond issue is to be not greater than
$2000,000 on the line from Oklahoma
City to Woodward, or less than
$15,000 per mile, probably the lowest
bond issue that has ever been made in
this state for the construction of a
railroad, and less than one-third of
the issue per mile of the older lines.
Bonds to Be Sold, r

road are bought by the banker at M.

'Hse roundup of motor iar owners
who were driving without state li
censes this morning was prosecuted
wilh such vigor that the officers them
selves were almost "overcome." Up
to noon today fifty automobile had
been "arrested" bv the police and of
ficers of the state highway department.
Tlte owners, who trailed their cars to
the polirotattn, were compelled to
deposit $11 ca.sh bond each for ap
pearance in municipal court
The delinquent owners were told to
go to (he highway department to get
licenses Those who drove their rars
from the station before getting the
tags were subject to rrarrrst. The
highway department had a double of
fice force working to issue tags
No Excuses Accepted.

During the labor parade, Byron

cars. Ollie Fstes, traffic officer, pi

Tight for Vetdun Over.
One nf the outstanding impressions
from this day's tour among all rankinr
officers and to all stragetiial point was
the absolute conviction of those on the
ground that the fight for Verdun ,s
over and that any prospect of the tier-
mans taking the town has gone for
ever. But it wa equally evident from
the strength and activity of the positions
the Germans hold that thev are still
keeping up1 the fight, but in steadily di
minishing intensity.
German Losses Half Million.
The German losses in the fuutless ef
fort to take Verdun are now known to
reach a dalf million men, while the
Fremh losses in successively holding
the town are less than half 'that num
ber. It is the helief in well informed quar
ter that the German gradually will
let go of Verdun, and before winter
they will try to shorten Iheir lines
along the whole wes(oili front by a
steady retnvgradr movement. Many of
ficer ay Rumania's entrance itthi the
war will precipitate the withdrawal and
an early German collapse. But more
conservative authorities feel that Ger
many will hang on for some time be
fore yielding to entente allied military
and economic superiority.

center of a, huge saucer, with the town
lying very low. while all around arose
an even rircle of crests forming the
outer edge of the saurer. The dangerous
proeLnity the Germans bad once
