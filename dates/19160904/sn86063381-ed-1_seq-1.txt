UNCLE SAM GETS
LINCOLN FARM
PLEAS MADE FOR
HIS AMERICANISM
Former Governor Folk Presents Cabin
and Farm for Lincoln Farm
Association.
LARGE CROWD ATTENDS
PRESENTATION CELEBRATION
President Wilson in Able Address Ac-
cepts Gift to Nation Gift by
Common People.
(By United Press)
Hodgensville, Ky., Sept. 4.Presi-
dent Lincoln's home farm and the
log cabin that he was born in were
formally presented to Uncle Sam by
the Lincoln Farm association, an or
ganization which rescued the place
from obscurity and neglect, here to
day. Most of the contributions for
the purchase came from the common
people Lincoln loved so well.
Former Governor Joseph W. Polk
of Missouri, president of the associa
tion, in presenting the farm and cabin
to the government, emphasized the
need for Americanism in the every
day life of the individual American,
in the government and particularly in
the foreign relations of the United
States. Mr. Folk said in part::
"The spirit of Lincoln is more alive
today than he lived in the flesh. His
ideals live in millions of American
freemen.
"He founded an Americanism that
is not a matter of creed or national
descent, but an ideal of the soul and
of the min"d an Americanism that is
not merely a union of political enti
ties, but of a common aspiration and
a common destiny.
"Lincoln's Americanism was so vir
ile that there need be no nation so
strong we should fear it, or so power
ful we should cower at its feet an
Americanism so just that the Golden
Rule may be the supreme law guiding
us in our diplomatic relations with
other nations an Americanism ready
to defend against the aggression of all
nations, but intentionally offending
none in puholding the principles of
the rights of man throughout the
world an Americanism that gives
hope to those whp would preserve
sacred Are of brotherhood now in
danger of being extinguished in the
sanguinary floods across the sea an
Americanism based upon service for
the common good and equality of op
portunity for all."
A large crowd was present for the
presentation celebration.
Wilson Accepts.
President Wilson accepted the gift
of the nation in an able address. He
arrived here with Mrs. Wilson at
9:40 o'clock this morning and en
route to the Lincoln farm stopped at
the court house and placed a wreath
on Lincoln's statue.
"No more significant memorial
could have been presented to this na
tion than this." said the president in
his address "It expresses so much
of what is singular and noteworthy
in the history of the country it sug
gests so many of the things that we
prize most highly in our life and in
our system of government."
Needs No Eulogy.
He concluded his address as fol
lows:
"I have come here today, not to
utter a eulogy on Lincoln he stands
in need of none, but to endeavor to
interpret the meaning of this gift
to the nation of the place of his
birth and origin. Is not this an
altar upon which we may forever keep
alive the vestal fire of democracy as
upon a shrine at which some of the
deepest and most sacred hopes of man
kind may from age to age be rekin
dled? For these hopes must con
stantly be rekindled, and only those
who live can rekindle them. The
only stuff that can retain the life
giving heat is the stuff of living
hearts. And the hopes of mankind
cannot be kept alive by words merely,
by constitutions and doctrines of
right and codes of liberty. The ob
ject of democracy is to transmute
these into the life and action of so
ciety, the self-denial and self-sacri
fice of heroic men and women willing
to make their lives an embodiment
of right and service and enlightened
purpose. The commands of demo
cracy are as imperative as its privil
eges and opportunities are wide and
generous. Its compulsion is upon us.
It will be great and lift a great light
for the guidance of the nations only
if we are great and carry that light
high for the guidance of our own
feet. We are not worthy to stand
here unless we ourselves be in deed
and in truth real democrats and ser
vants of mankind, ready to give our
very lives for the freedom and justice
and spiritual exaltation of the great
nation which shelters and nurtures

"WBrl
AUinfOR IS
ORDERED OUT
HEARINGS TO
RE6IN TUESDAY
L. H. Slocum of Koochiching County
is Suspended by Governor
Burnquist.
INQUIRY TO BE MADE OF
ALLEGED ILLEGAL DEALS
Attorney M. J. Brown of Bemidji is
Named Commissioner Private
Citizens Protest.
Charges of illegal expenditures ag
gregating more than $200,000 by
Koochiching county officials resulted
Saturday in orders by Governor
Burnquist suspending County Audi
tor L. H. Slocum and placing L. W.
Wilson of Virginia in charge of the
auditor's office and appointing At
torney M. J. Brown of Bemidji as
commissioner to take evidence in an
official investigation.
The action of Governor Burnquist
is the culmination of an investigation
of the affairs of the county covering
several months.
Attorney General L. A. Smith and
Andrew Fritz, state public examiner,
made a personal investigation of
Koochiching county two months ago.
County Near Bankruptcy.
It was reported then that the coun
ty was almost on the verge of bank
ruptcy because bond issues had been
made for more than the assessed
valuation and it was evident some-'
thing was wrong.
The grand jury found no criminal
negligence on the part of any of the
county officers. Nothing more was
done until the governor Friday re
ceived the complaint signed by D. J.
Kennedy, O. P. Swanson, T. M. How
ard and H. W. Key^s, taxpayers, of
International Falls, charging the
county auditor with misuse of coun-r
ty funds in the payment of road con
tracts to the Northwestern Con
struction company.
Work Not Anproved.
This company, according to the al
legations filed with the governor, re
ceived from the county auditor from
April, 1914, to June, 1916, $76,670
ttff-payment for -work^don*1
ti
FORTY CENTS PER MONTH
(fit' statttr
road No. 24. This work had not been
approved by the state highway en
gineer nor was the contract com
pleted when the company was paid,
according to the allegations.
Auditor Slocum also issued war
rants to the construction company for
$46,462 for work done on state road
No. 5. This work had not been com
pleted, it is alleged, nor had the en
gineer certified the amount that
should be paid to the auditor before
payment was made by him.
Charge Secret Agreement.
It is further alleged that Slocum
had entered into a secret agreement
with the contractors whereby bids
could not be received from other
companies for the highway work.
It was also alleged that some other
county officials were implicated, but
no specific charges were made.
A further allegation was that the
auditor had arranged with A. El
der, Duluth, to negotiate the sale of
$1,660,000 in county bonds for which
the county paid Mr Elder $95,715.
This amount could have been saved
the county, it was alleged, by having
it sell the bonds itself.
Five major charges on which the
governor acted are as follows:
FirstAn allegation that Auditor
Slocum issued warrants for $76,-
650.23 in favor of the Northwestern
Construction company, as county pay
ment on a road contract of which no
part was completed.
SecondA further allegation that
the auditor issued other warrants in
favor of the same contracting com
pany that were $14,348.14 in excess
of authority.
Agreement Alleged.
ThirdThat Auditor Slocum en
tered a secret agreement with the
Northwestern company, prior to the
letting of road construction contracts,
against permitting competitice bid
ding so that the contracts "would be
let to the Northwestern company at
prices to net handsome profits to be
divided between the company and
Auditor Slocum and other county of
ficials," and that through inexperi
ence and incompetence of an engineer
the first estimates were so low that
original plans could not be worked
out and that "to secure funds to
build the road and provide spoils for
himself and other county officials,"
it is further alleged that Slocum is
sued warrants to the Northwestern
company in excess of the 85 per cent
provided in the contract, and, in fact,
for more than $50,000 in excess of all
contracts."
FourthAuditor Slocum is charged
with failure to resell a road con
struction contract as provided by law.
County Bonds Sold.
FifthThat Koochiching county
bonds have been sold in the sums of
$1,368,000 for ditches and $300,000
for roads, all through G. A. Elder of
Duluth, and that the county paid
$95,715 commissions on such sales
also, it is alleged, Auditor Slocum in
this connection entered into another
agreement refusing information to
prevent competitive bidding to make
it appear to the county commission
ers that payment of commissions was
necessary when the bonds, it is as-'*
serted. could have been sold at par.
