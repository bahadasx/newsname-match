ZAIM'IS RULES GREECE.
Premier Has United Support of Ven
izelos and Hiss Opponents.
Athens, Sept. 4.—Seizing-the oppor
tunity offered by the presence at
Piraeus\ within gunshot of Athens, of
a large fleet of the entente nations,
Premier Zaimis has assumed unob
structively what amounts to dictatorial
powers. All is ready for the final act
to end the neutrality of Greece.
While the people of Athens were
being mildly amused at the sight of
allied sailors and police pursuing Ger
man agents about the streets, a pro
found change in the status of affairs
was made quietly. Premier Zaimis is
now in a position to swing the wholfe
country as he will, Unembarrassed by
any dissenting popular opinion or hos
tile control. The first Step which
placed power in his hands was taken
when he forbade the gatherings last
Wednesday. The arrangement of Fri
day, whereby the issuance of the de
cree dissolving the parliament and
calling new elections was postponed
indefinitely, disposed effectually of any
interference with the policy of the
government. Finally the premier yes
terday aaked' and received the support
of the leaders of the Venizelos party
and of the. party opposed to Venizelos.

practically nil, is exactly what was re

believe that another air ship, in addi
tion to the one destroyed, was dam
aged.

chief director of the German propa
ganda in Greece, has been arrested and
taken on board a cruiser of the en

New York, Sept. 4.—Freight traffic
on all railroads entering New Yorl
held up by embargoes due to the fear
of a strike, Is moving again today on
normal schedule. Railroad men say
that little congestion has resulted.
Large quantities of merchandise had
been shipped immediately previous to
the Issuance of hold-up orders. Today
being a holiday, shipments will be light
and the roads will have an opportunity
to catch up with the regular move
ment of freight.
A number of strike-breakers, It fs
said, were employed on contracts which
have a week and some even a month
to run.
Provision dealers say that the mar
ket will slump during the next few
days because a large quantity of food
stuffs held by speculators in expecta
tion of famine prices, will be dumped
on the market.
Food Gamblers Caught.
Food dealers who gambled on the
expected Isolation of New York from
outside supplies as a result of the
threatened railroad strike and held back
shipments to unload at famine prices
found themselves overwhelmed by their
own crops. Prices suddenly collapsed
with the averting of the^ strike and the
food gamblers were caught with much
food on their hands. One speculator is
said to have lost hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
Leaders Close Offices.

for more than a quarter of a century
one of the republican leaders in Mis

Mr. Kerens was a pioneer in the
transportation field. In 1872 he moved
passengers, mail and express from tlio

ments. In 1874 he became contractor
for the Southern Overland Mail Service,
a transportation service by stage coach
covering more than 1,400 miles. At that
time he lived in Sun Diego, Cal.
When the development of railroads
eliminated the wagon and stage coach
as a factor in transcontinental traffic,
Mr. Kerens settled In St. Louis and be
came active in politics and in the de
velopment of railroads. He was inter
ested in the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe the St. Louis Southern, the Los
Angeles Terminal ,the San Pedro, Los

Washington, Sept. 4.—Labor Day
brought no cessation of activity to
congress, which, having spent nearly
all of last week on measures warding
off the railroad strike called for toilav,
hoped for a belated adjournment Wed
nesday or Thursday. Many members
already had fled to political fields or
their homes, leaving fag-ends of leg

houses.
The Webb bill to allow American ex

agencies abroad, the immediate pass
age of which President Wilson favors,
the revenue bill and the Porto ltican
citizenship bill are to be acted on in

Echo of Eight-Hour Bill.
Senator Reed today introduced a
resolution to authorize the interstate
commerce commission to investigate
the eight-hour day law and report to
congress in December. The resolution
will be called up for consideration to
morrow.
Senators Simmons and Martin and
Majority Lender Kitchin, of the house
agreed, today, that the house should

Only Mrs. Wilson, the president's

on Tuesday he will present to the four

That there may be no question as
to the legality of the measure as a re

Strike Order Recalled.
Three hours after the senate had
passed without amendment the Adam
son eight-hour day bill, passed by the
house Friday, the heads of the four
great raihroad employes" brotherhoods
telegraphed 600 odd code messages to
their general chairmen in all parts of
the country cancelling the strike order
issued a week ago to take effect Mon
day morning at 7 o'clock.
The. legislative expedient to avert the
strike was passed in the senate by a
vote of 43 to 38—almost a strict party
vote—amid stirring scenes, after many
senators, democrats and republicans,
had fought desperately to amend the
measure by provisions designed to pre
vent Industrial disasters in the future.
•Some senators, thoroughly aroused,
declared congress was being coerced
into enactment of legislation that it
did not desire and that it knew would
return to plague it In the future.
Leaders Change Minds.
In both houses the measure was
signed within a few minutes after the
final vote in the senate and It was sent
at once to the White House where
President Wilson signed It at 7:03
o'clock Sunday morning after his re
turn from Shadow Lawn.
Officials of the brotherhoods who
witnessed the final passage of the bill
had announced early in the night that
cancellation of the strike would not be
ordered until the bill had been signed
by the president and actually had be
come a law. But later they conferred,
changed their minds and flashed the
code message signaling to the wait
ing trainmen of the country thru their
chairmen the message that a satisfac
tory settlement had been obtained,
Main Points of Bill.
The bill that stopped the strike pro
vides that after January 1, 1917, eight
hours shall be regarded as a basis of
reckoning for a day's pay of men en

trains in interstate commerce (except
ing roads less than 100 miles long and

hours, and that their rate of compen

investigation for six or nine months of
the effect of the eight-hour day upon
the railroads by a commission to be
appointed by the president.
Amendments Fail.
Efforts to amend the bill in the sen

Itailroad officials have declared that
the action of congress will cost them
SCO,000.000 a year In Increased wages
to the trainmen. Brotherhood of
ficials say the enactment will mean not
more than an annual Increase of $10,
000,000. In congress and among the
railroad officials there has existed
doubt us to the constitutionality of the
law, but what steps if any may be
taken to test this has not been indi
cated.
The measure embraces virtually all
of President Wilson's original propos
als to the employes and the railroad
heads, altho ft is only a pnrt of the leg
islative program he took to congress
last Tuesday when his negotiations
had failed.
President Sign* Bill.
The Adamson eight-hour day bill,
passed hy congress last week to avert
the nation-wide railroad strike ordered
for today, was signed by President
Wilson in his private car at the
Union station, where he stopped on Ills
way from Shadow Lawn, N. J., to
Hodgensvllle, Ky. That there may be
no question as to the legality of the
measure as a result of its being signed
on Sunday, the president will affix his
signature again on his return to Wash
ington next Tuesday.
How long peace shall reign as a re
sult of the bill Is dependent upon de
velopments in the proposed test of the
constitutionality of the act. Should the
railroads take no Hction. but await the
beginning of an Investigation of the
workings of the eight-hour day by the
special commission for which the
measure provides, the brotherhoods will
remain Inactive.
Strike to Follow Attack.
The employes' leaders declare, how
ever, that should the law be hold un
constitutional, and the railroads at
tempt to restore the ten-hour day on
their lines ,a strike will follow prompt
ly.
None of the brotherhood lenders wit
nessed the signing of the bill. They
had expected, according to tentative
arrangements made by Secretary Wil
son Inst night, to be present, but the
president decided to attend to the busi
ness at the railroad station. The four
pens used by the president In signing
the bill—one for each syllable of his
name—will be presented to the four
brotherhood heads, A. B. Garretson, W.
G. Lee. W. S. Carter and W. A. Stone,
after being used for re-signing the bill
Tuesday.
