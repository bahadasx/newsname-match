I orulon, Sept. 8. Advani-ing along a
front of six miles north nf the aVaBBBB
the French anrl British forrrs to-day
struck their greatest blow In weeks at
the enemy.
I in- pflBiarfal joint attacfc ?on foe
thr Mlieil Iiines tlu- rUaflfflfl of Or>,
Lfl I'lirrst, Cuilli-mont and part of
(jinrhy; eattaded their lines ncarly half
u mile at every point and brought them
to tlie \ery outskirts of ('omldcs, ami
swept in nearly 8,<XN) prisoners.
The attaek was one of the niost fifl
leat made in the two month* of light
ing on this front and far more than
evened the M-orr for the small (ierman
g.tins won in the eounter offensive ol
last week.
Alliea Attaek on All Front..
With this attack the Allies are again
on the orTrnsive on all fronts, and tlu
respitr which the liermans had while
the Humanian question was being s?t
tled is ended. At a time wlieii Ihr
Aimtro-tierman armies are beina- driven
from their vital positiens aa thfl Iron
(jates of the Danune and (lertinny haa
sent 50,000 men to attrnipt to stem the
tide and avert dl-a.strr, Kussia, Italy,
and now Rritnin nnd Fran< e, have again
applierl the pres.-ure wUrtl had BCOVflfll
hia much even before thr RaflflBBBflfll
battle besMn.
Only along a part of the souttmn
Ralkan front ia the pressure still sltght.
Grrmany, again, cannot hope to dr.w
troops from any front to mret th.
neon! flt another, without risking gravo
disaste..
The lateat Allied success in tha
Somme region earries tho British front
500 yards east of Guillemont, from
Ginchy to Falfemort Farm, while it
extends the French lines almost on top
of Combles and as much as half a mile,
east of their former poflitioflfl in thfl
district between Combles and C\erf.
The besiegers' guns now threat.n
CofltBlflfl from the west, sou'h and eait.
In a few dav.s no forces will bo ahlo to
livr within the sheil-torn ruins of th.t
town. ,
Peronne Threat Inrre.se<|.
Ry capturing Clery tho Franro Brit
ish troops together have aceomplirhed
-.4 hat the Freneh alone fout.d too d,f
tieulf a task. Foch's soldiers had en
tored Clery boforo, but eounter .?
piaaaad with a vigor whirh
srom.s to bave. left tha German-. of l.te,
Fucceede<l in turning thom out
again. With the town permanently in
their possession Peronne cannot mueh
longer wtthstand the pressure to which
it will be exposed from ihe north.
Ginchy will hardly bo able either to
resist tne pressure which tho Briti-h
hold will expoae the 'ierman defenders
to, and crities here Iook for the com?
plete occupation of the village with'ii
a day or two. It aeems certain that th.
British will bo able to hold Guillemont
now againat all eounter ns.iaults.
Thus the grip which the Alliea hat.
obtained on the German aerond line.
will be turned agair.st thom. From now
on the Allied push should win inereafl
ingly greater victones along the whole
front, poasibly smaahing through the
enemy's defences for a real drive oa
Bapaume before the winter set? in.
Germans Sarrenderlng.
Tho eapture of BO many prisoners by
the Allied forces in this operation M
regarded hrre aa highly signitirant.
(ibservers believe that it indieatoa
either one of two things: that the Al?
lied attack is showing a power sueh
as has never been realized before, or
that the German soldiers, weary of tha
battle, are again surrendering in large
numbers witBOBt offering whole-heart
oil resistancr. Rrports of the surren?
der of (ierman trcops on this front
aro reachmg London in ever incrcas-.ng
numbers.
To-day's operations by the Alliflfl
were not confined to the Somme fron'.
Simultaneously with the great drive to
their west, Hn-.g'.? troops in 'ho Thiep
val region extended their lines ne.r
the Mcuquet Farm and along tha
Ancre, while Petiin's forces ?truck be.
forc Verdun and won frenh advarees in
the neighborhood of Fleury. The Ger?
mans also returned to their attacks in
this sector, launching spinted assaults
at Vaux and Chapitre. At all but on?
nomt they were hut led baek with heaTf"
losses. Three hundred prisoners fell
into French hands in these engage
ments.
