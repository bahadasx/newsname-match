G. W. KOUNS DEAD
AFTER STRUGGLE
WITH THEUNIONS
General Manager of Santa Fe
Dies in Topeka Home.
Following Siege on Strike Sit

DIPLOMAT IN RAILWAY WORK
Well Known All Oyer Country
as an Authority.
Funeral Will Be Held in To
pt'ka Wednesday Afternoon.
C W. Kouns, 6 2 years old, general
manager f the eastern lines of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, died
at 6:30 o'clock Sunday morning, Sn
his home, 907 Topeka avenue, in this
city after an illness of only a ahort du
ration. Death, according to attending
physicians, was due to overwork and
a complication of indigestion and
heart trouble.
C. W. Kouns.
(His Favorite Photograph.)
Mr. Kouns, a few hours before his
death, had arrived home from Wash
ington, where he had been taking part
in the wage negotiations as a mem
ber of the committee of seventeen
general managers representing the
railroads. During the last month of
the controversy he worked almost day
and night.
Santa Fe employes from the shops
and offices here will attend the fu
neral in a body.
The offices and shops both will be
closed Wednesday from noon.
Manv officials from all over the sys
tem will be in the city to attend the
funeral. Officials of other railroads
have announced their intentions of
coming.
Three years ago Mr. Kouns suffered
an illness which physicians say was
the forerunner of that which caused
his death. For some time he suffered
from an attack of rheumatism and in
digestion. After his recovery however,
he did not experience much trouble
of a similar nature until recently.
Went East In July.
Mr. Kouns left for Washington in
July. August 22 he suffered what
physicians told him was an at
tack of indigestion. His trouble
was similar to that which he
suffered three years ago. However,
he refused to go to bed and was at
work with his committee every day
until the following Saturday when his
condition became worse. His illness
became so serious that Dr. J. P.
Raster, head of the Santa Fe hospital
here, was sent for, and left imme
diately for Washington. Doctor Kas
, ter was at Mr. Kouns's side until the
official's death. Mr. Kouns started
home Friday.
lie stood the trip well, according to
physicians. It was said in the general
offices here while he was en route
home that he was recovering. How
ever, when he arrived here at 11:25
o'clock Saturday night his condition
was critical. His condition became
worse and a few hour later he passed
away.
Mr. Kouns was probably one of the
most prominent railroad managers in
the country. He was one of the old
school of officials that is growing less
every year those who rise from the
Sketch of His Life.
He was born in New Holland, Ohio.
He began his railroad career in 1871
as a brakeman on the Kansas Pacific,
now merged into the Union Pacific.
Later he served as telegraph operator,
station agent and train dispatcher on
that line. In 1877 he went to Texas as
a conductor on the International &
Great Northern, where he was soon
promoted to trainmaster. A short time
later he went to the Galveston, Harris
burg & San Antonio railroad as train
master and superintendent of trans
portation. In 188 3 he was made assistant su
perintendent of the Union Pacific,
Nebraska division, and in 1885 he
went to the Texas & Pacific as chief
clerk to the general superintendent.
He began service with the Santa Fe
in 18R8 as chief clerk to the general
superintendent. In 1889 he was made
superintendent of car service, servi
in that capacity until 1901 when he
became assistant general superintend
ent. Then he became superintendent
of transportation. In 1907 he became
assistant to the vice president in
charge of operation. He became gen
eral manager of western lines in 1907

Means Work That Has Been

Declares.
WAS FOR BETTER SERVICE
That Was the Object of the
Threatened Strike.
Speaker Touches on Other
Phases of Labor Problem.
Declaring that no fair minded per
sons, excepting those befuddled by the
publicity agents of the railroads will
for one moment stand on the side of
the railroad companies in their fight
against the railroad brotherhood,
Louis F. Post, assistant secretary of
the United States department of labor,
this afternoon at the Labor day cele
bration at Garfield park, outlined the
position of the railroad brotherhoods.
Mr. Post was introduced by Governor
Capper, following the big two-mi'e
parade.
"You have been told," said Mr. Post,
"that the threatened strike was to se
cure an eight-hour day with ten hours'
wages. Tou have been told and still
are told that this will cost the rail
road corporations millions upon mil
lions of dollars for the wage increase.
"Do you realize that no such con
dition is involved?
"The threatened railroad strike was
for the purpose of securing better rail
road service. At one time the rail
road men were kept on duty for thirty,
forty, fifty and even sixty hours at a
stretch. Their only chance for sleep
was in a caboose, or on a locomotive,
during all those hours.
Same Old Cry.
"The reason for it was that the rail
roads were being controlled not by
railroad men, but by financiers; not in
the interest of good transportation
service, but in the interest of plunder
ing profits. Senator LaFollette se
cured a law which limited consecutive
service to sixteen hours a day. The
same outcry was made against him
that is being made now that the rail
roads could not afford it.
"And now the railroad operatives
thru bad management of the finan
ciers the kind of management that
has wrceked the Hartford & New
Haven, the Rock Island and . the
Frisco are forced to make less than
reasonable speed. A fair rate of speed
would be 124 miles an hour. They
have been kept down to ten miles an
hour and less.
"What the men threatened to strike
for was 12 miles an hour, which
would cover 100 miles in eight hours,
the hundred miles that have been cov
ered in ten hours or more. Now why
should it cost the railroads any more
to cover 100 miles in eight hours than
to cover 100 miles in ten. If they
will manage their roads decently they
can cover the 100 miles at the same
wages at which they are covernig that
run now."
Average Wage Too Low.
Practically every phase of the labor
problem was discussed by Mr. Post in
his address. Laboring men should be
proud, he declared.
Mr. Post quoted statistics to nrove
that the average wage earner in
America does not recevie a living wage
for a family.
The Single Tax.
In closing, Mr. Post made a strong
argument for a single tax, a tax that
will take a penalty off of industry and
derive money for government from in
creases in land values. At present, he
declared, half the people of the
United States are tenants and there is
hardly any public land left.

blowing at the rate or 28 miles an iiour
from the southwest. Today was the
warmest day since August 25.
Last night was the warmest night in
Topeka since August 21. A south
wind blowing from fifteen to twenty
miles an hour was responsible. for the
high temperature. The wind con
tinued this morning and increased to
twenty-four miles an hour. The mini
mum temperature last night was 72
degrees, 10 degrees above normal. To
day is the seventieth consecutive day
without a good rain, according to S.
D. Flora, local weather observer, and
there is nothing to indicate an early
end to the dry spell.
The forecast calls for generally fair
weather tonight and Tuesday; slightly
cooler tonight. Altho the mercury
stayed above the 70 degree mark last
night, the night was not uncomforta
ble owing to the wind. The highest
temperature Sunday was 81 degrees,
altho the day was cloudy an1 a fresh
wind blew all day. A light trace of
rain fell Sunday morning. Today the
sky was clear and the mercury was
expected to go higher than Sunday.
The highest temperature on record
for this date is 100 degrees, establish

THE SMOKE OF STACKS HE SEES A REAL HOME OF HIS OWN
RIPLEY IS SORRY
Santa Fe Head Wanted to See
Strike Test Made.
Strange Code Messages by Un
ions Called It Off.
Chicago, Sept 4. From Chicago
the railroad unions sent telegrams to
every division point on western rail
roads, informing both railway officials
and trainmen that the strike is off.
A general attitude of relief was ex
pressed by railway officials. Presi
dent E. P. Ripley of the Atchison, To
peka & Santa Fe railway, said, how
ever, that he was sorry the question
had not come to a critical test.
"1 am sorry it has been called off."
Mr. Ripley said. "The Adamson bill
doesn't become effective until January
1. Between now and then we can de
cide what to do. I can't say just when
we will do anything, but the law sure
ly will be tested." ,
In congress and among the railroad
officials there has existed doubt as to
the constitutionality of the law. but
what steps, if any, may be taken to
test it hag not been indicated.
All the code messages calling off
the strike had been prepared in ad
vance. No two of the more than six
hundred dispatches were alike. One
of them read: "It is reported that a
big fire is raging in Toronto." Another
said: "There ig danger of your house
burning down."

Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 4.
Two years ago in Greater London,
Freddie Welsh of Pontypridd, Wales,
wrested the lightweight boxing cham
pionship of the world from Willie
Ritchie, an American. Today before
these westerners he defends it against
an American in what is- called "Little
Lunnon," this little mountain resort
of Colorado Springs, and for the first
time since he won the title Welsh is
booked to travel the 20-round route
with challenger Charlie White.
Probably never was a championship
battle fought in such quaint and pic
turesque surroundings. The gigantic
arena which has been splendidly
erected for the fight rests in a grass
grown hollow four blocks from the
center of the town. To the east
stretches for miles and miles sun
burned prairie, while to the west, in
all its stupendous glory, rises Pike's
Peak, a heap of brown granite, to an
elevation of 14,000 feet. Far up on
its tip a white ring of enow can just
be seen. Below to the west is the con
tinental divide, swathed in snow and
across which a western br-s:e gently
whipped today.
Interest Intense.
In this poetic setting thousands of
fight "bugs" raved early today, every
one an authority, every one a critic,
shouting mind bets, predicting this,
predicting that and every other possi
bility of a championship battle.
The only thing universally believed
was that when Freddie Welsh and
Charley White, the Chicago pretender,
sailed into each other this afternoon
mere would oe a Ilgnt. This was
based upon the frank arrangement of
the fighters and their managers to bar
notning in tne method of fighting.
ine only restriction placed upon the
champion and his opponent is that
which will prevent holding and hit
ting. Everything else goes blows in
tne break, kidney punches, clinch
milling and what not of fighters'
tricks. Everything's fair above the
Delt.
Referee Billy Roche's announce
ment that the decision, if the fight
goes me iuu zu rounds will be given
on points, also was well received.
No Stalling Goes.
"The first round counts as much as
the last," said Roche. "A flash fin
ish by either man will count no more
in the summary than sturdy battling
in the early rounds.
White and Welsh stuck to their
suburban cottages early today, as
they did Sunday, excepting a little
road work and a few minutes with the
punching bag. Both men exhibited
no end of confidence and, so far as
could be judged, betrayed no uneasi
ness.
Harry Pollok, Welsh's manager and
Nate Lewis, White's pilot, established
themselves Sunday In the Antlers ho
tel, where they were assailed with
suggestions by all manner of charac
ters from hitherto aloof old dowagers
to pugs who are the camp dogs of all
big bouts.
The rich lobby of that expensive re
sort was in a constant din of gossip
today. Tanned giants of the west with
wide brimmed hats discussed the com
mon topic with sleek and dapper
salesmen from the east. Coats, bulg
ing at the hips, concealed more dead
ly things than pocket flasks. Fight
"bugs" from all quarters of the west
streamed into the springs during the
morning on special trains.

Down Kansas Avenue.
Largest Labor Day Celebration
in History of City.
THIRTY-FIVE MERCHANT FLOAT
Other Features of Demonstra"
tion for the Local Unions.
Men in Afternoon Sport Events
at Garfield Park.
Two thousand Topeka laboring men
marched in a solid line two miles long
today and presented to Topeka citi
xens the biggest Labor day parade in
the history of the city, the opening of
the Labor day celebration.
Only a few hours before organized
labor, represented in Topeka by this
long line of men, through its power
had broken all legislative records and
had won the greatest victory in the
history when congress passed an 8
hour day law for railroad brother
hoods despite the protests of millions
of dollars of capital. Probably every
citizen in Topeka, who witnessed the
parade today, thought of the power
of this organization brought home to
them a few hours before and the men
themselves were thinking of it, too, no
doubt.
Merchants Floats Many.
'Thirty-five floats manufactured by
friendly Topeka merchants added to
floats prepared by the unions punc
tuated the long line and added color to
the parade. Also there was a number
of unexpected features, among them
being a float by the Christian Endeav
or society and an industrial display
by the boys of the Topeka Industrial
school.
Starting promptly at 1 o'clock from
Sixth avenue and Monroe streets, the
parade began the long march to Gar
field park. A special feature was the
review by the leaders. . Fred W. Fel
ton, marshal of the day, R. I. Cross-
white, aide, members of the police
department and Marshall's band
started first from Sixth avenue and
Monroe street and marched south to
Tenth avenue reviewing the other
sections lined on both sides of Mon
roe street from Sixth to Tenth avenue.-
Gradually the various sections fell in
line. -
AU Had a Surprise.
It was not until they marched past
the line of parade that the leaders had
any idea of the m.ognitude and beauty
cf the floats prepared by the various
unions and merchants. Each union
and each merchant had tentatively
agreed to keep all others in ignorance
of the nature of the floats and thus
surprise those in the parade as well as
the thousands of spectators lining
Kansas avenue from Tenth avenue to
Garfield park where the parade dis
banded. The float prepared by Crosby Broth
ers probably attracted as much atten
tion as that of any merchant. Crane
& Company's float also called forth
much applause. The cigar makers,
electricians, printers and building
trades council all had pretty floats
representing their organizations by
clever designs. A noticeable feature
of the floats was the number of signs
on them bearing the painters' and dec
orators' labels. The growth of this
organization probably has been more
rapid in the last year tnan tnai ot any
other in Topeka.

Upon reaching Garfield park, those
marching in the parade, were given
large slices of iced watermelon fur

Immediately Louis F. Post, assistant
secretary of the United States depart

Wilson to Sign Bill Again to
Insure Its Legality.
Washington, Sept. 4. A llngertnsT
year of warfare still clung to the rail
brotherhoods today. Tho reasonably
confident the eight hour bill, now a,
law, means a year of peace on -he rail
lines, brotherhood men frankly said
there will be a strike if the transporta
tion chiefs ever try to restore the tea
hour' system.
They thought the railroads may test
the constitutionality of the measure
which President Wilson signed yester
day; but if the courts deem it uncon
stitutional and then the lines try to
revert to ten hours, the strike threat
of recent weeks will be renewed. ?
The more optimistie say the wag
commission created by the eight hour
law will find that the men's cause Is
just. In this event, they say the rail
roads are scarcely likely to overturn
the law, constitutional or unconstitu
tional. Further, the fact that th
brotherhoods are ready and willing to
aid the lines in getting rate increases,
if such are necessary, is regarded as
peace overture the roads will not
scorn.
Affects Unorganized Men, Too.
Only A. B. Garretson. W. S. Carter
and W. S. Stone of the brotherhood
heads remained here today.
W. G. Lee, trainmen's leader, re
turned to Cleveland last night. Ho
said:
"Passage of the eight hour bin will
aid not only the organised but also
the unorganized laborers of the coun-
try. It will show the latter what or
ganization can accomplish and it will
be the beginning of a universal eight
hour system."
In view of the fact that some per
sons have questioned the legality of a
bill signed on Sunday, President Wil
son will again sign the document to
morrow. Only Two Democrats Against Bill.
. XJnly two Democrats Senator
Hardwick of Georgia and Clarke of
Arkansas finally voted, against the
bill, and one Republican La Follette
, of Wisconsin voted for it.
Railroad officials have declared
that the action of congress will cost
them 60 million dollars a year in in
creased wages to the trainmen. Broth
erhood officials say the enactment
will mean not more than an annual
increase of 20 million.
Senator Reed asserted that a quor
um of the house was not in Washing
ton when the senate passed the bill;
that it therefore would have been im
possible to pass the bill If amended
in any particular, in time to avert the
strike Monday and congress would be
blamed for the disaster if It were not
stayed in accordance with tho plana
designed by house leaders.
The majority of the senators ad
mitted that they were afraid to
change the dotting; of an "1" or th
crossing of a "t" In the house bill, to
fear that It might serve to forestall
prevention of the strike.
Error Almost Caused Walkout.
Houston, Tex., Sept. 4. A strike of
all trainmen on the Southern Paciflo
lines in Louisiana and Texas was
averted here by the timely discovery
and correction of an error in tne oode

CONFIDENT OF WINNING
Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 4.
Welsh and White gave the fol

at 9 a. m.:
BY FREDDIE WELSH. I
Freddie Welsh, world's light
weight champion I think I stand
In better condition today to win
from White than in any of our
three former battles. I am In good
trim, feel great and bear no uneasi
ness regarding the result. I do
not underestimate my opponent. I
realize that the battle will be hard
but I think I can beat him easily
and perhaps stop htm.
BY CHARLEY WHITE.
Charley White, challenger No
man who ever fought a ring battle
could possibly have felt better than
I do today. I have trained hard
for many weeks In the belief that I
will take the title from Welsh and
and I intend to do it today. I think
my big chance has come to bring
the title back to America and I'm
sure Welsh is due to be beaten.
That's all. I'm not afraid of the
result.
