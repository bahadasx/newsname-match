PHILLIES' BALL PARK, Sept. 4. Be
fore the largest crowd that ever attended a
morning game In this city, the Phillies
made It four straight from the league-lead
ing Dodgers In one of the most nerve-racking
and thrilling games ever witnessed here.
The final score was 3 to 1, and the fans
were on edge from start to finish.
Both of the Phllly runs were tallied on
home-run drives. In the third inning Bill
Klllefer smashed a long drive into the left
field bleachers for the circuit, while In the
fourth Captain Luderus poled one of Rube
Marquard's shoots far over the fence in
right center,
Ersklne Mayer was on the mound for the
Phillies and pitched beautiful ball for eight
innings. In the ninth doubles by Cutshaw
and Miller gave Brooklyn- its lone tally and
put the tying run on second base.
At this stae Manager Moran called upon
Alexander tho Great to stop the rally and
the famous Nebraskan made a good jpb of
It. forcing Pinch Hitter O'Mara to pop a
short fly to Cravath.
The crowd was crazy-mad at the end of
the game and carried the. Phllly players to
the clubhouse.
The victory placed the Phillies within
one game from first place, Moran's fighting

MERION GOLF CLUD, Sept. 4. Two
hugo straw-hatted and bcflannelcd galleries,
dotted hero and there with tho bright nttlro
which marked tho presenco of feminine fans,
turned out bright and early this morning
to follow tho play of Bob Gardner, amateur
golf champion of tho United States, and
Chick Evans, the United Slates open chnm
pldn". .' Both players put forth their best
efforts to win tho medal In tho qualifying
rcund, which is being plays for tho ama
teur championship of tho United States nnd
as a mark of appreciation for the perfect
day and tho applause of the gathering.
Hundreds of fans were gathered on the
east course, where tho best of tho stars
played, while the other half of the Held was
busy on the west course. This afternoon
tho split field will change about.
The first score In on the west course was
that of G. A. Ormlston, of Oakmont, near
Pittsburgh, who shot a 78, which was good
enough for the first round over a course
whero It Is felt that, tho players will have
to break 80 in order to qualify. Chlsholm
Beach, Fox Hills, had an 86 on the west
course. Ormlstpn was out In 41, but came
through the last halt in only one stroke
more.
Bob Gardner started with a five on the
first hole of (he east course, but he got a
five on the second, and then got down to
business. His left forefinger, whjch be
came infected a week ngo, now seems about
well. He Is able to bend It freely nnd It is
wrapped only with light gauze and adhesive
tape.

ATHENS TO ENTER WAR
PARIS, Sept. 4. Grecco hns accepted all
tho demands of tho Allies as contained In
tho Joint noto presented by tho Ministers
of Franco and England nt Athens. The
action of Greece nssures a policy of full
co-operation between tho Hellenic Govern
ment and tho Entente Powers and Is re
garded as preliminary to tho nctlvo en
tranco of Greece- into tho war against the
Central Empires.
ATHENS, Sept. 4.
A policy of full co-operation by Greece
with the Entento Allies under a coalition
Cabinet, as a preliminary to active lnter
'vpntlon. has 'been decided on. Tho new
plan Involves the Indefinite postponement!
of tho elections and tho continuance ot
Zalmls as Premier, with tho support of
Venlzelos.,
The Greek Government has decided to
agree to demands of Great Britain and
France for full control of tho posts nnd
telegraphs, to prevent Information reach
ing their enemies, and to tho expulsion
of Daron von Schenk and 60 of tho ad
herents who have been working In tho
Interests of the Teutons. There are Indi
cations that tho Allies will also ask to be
allowed to Uso the Piraeus as' a base for
the supplying of tho western wing of the
army In tho Balkans and that this will
bo permitted.
EVENTS MOVE RAPIDLT
Events nro moving very rapidly toward
an early announcement of n most important
change In the attitude of Greece. Already
Venlzclos nnd nUtl-Venlzelos newspapers
that for a year have been accusing each
other ot treachery are beginning to preach
unity In the face of the national crisis,
Ex-Premier Venlzelos has declared his
full confidence In Tremler Zalmls. the only
difference hitherto separating them being
the latter's Insistence on holding the elec
tions at this Juncture. In such event Venl
zelos threatened to abstain from tho elec
tions. Tho reconstruction of the Greek Cabinet
with two adherents of Venlzelos, General
Danglls and M. Repoulls, Is probable, while
an official announcement of the postpone
ment of the election is a foregone con
elusion.
DEMAND OF ALLIES
Representatives at Athens of Great
Britain and France- have presented to the
Greek rjoyernment a noto demanding con
trol over the Greek posts and telegraphs
and insisting ' on , the deportation from
Oreece of agents of the Central Powers. The
note reads as follows:

CONGRESS PLANS ACTION
Now Code of Laws to Go vera
Railroads "Coming Up at v
Next Session
WASHINGTON1, Sept 4. National lead
ers of labor, nt their .headquarters 'here to
day, called this the greatest labor Day In
history. Coming1 contemporaneously with'
tho settlement, temporarily, at least, ot th
greatest Industrial demand that over"
threatened tho nation, national leaders' of
labor declared that this Labor vDay herald.
cd tho cjmlnff ot increased power for labor.
With tho eight-hour day for railway
operative, employes recognized and legattxed
by Congress and the Administration, labor'
leaders say their victory, won within a,
comparatively fow days, Is tho first poaltlva
step toward granting a national eight-hour
workday. Determined, continued fights
nro now being planned for other legislation
for An eight-hour day.
W'th tho absence ot Samuel Gompers,
president of tho American Federation .of
Labor, who -wilt mako an address In Iowls-
ton, Me., thcro was no official labor event In .
Washington today. Members Of tho. local'
unions attended out-of-door exercises to
day. - ADVANCEMENT IN TEAR
Frank Morrison, secretary of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, was spokesmaa
for labor by Issuing a statement summar
izing labor's advancement In the last year.
"It is Impossible to record fundamental
gains during tho year because of organized.
labor's agitation, or to individualize prob
able gains during tho coming year," ho
said. "The best we can do Is to obsery
tendencies. Prominent among these Is .the
wotkora' seizure of the cry for 'prepared
ness' to emphasize a danger in Industry'
more dangerous than battlefields.
"Government statistics show that 30,008"
men are annually killed and 700,000 are
annually Injured.
"It has been stated that there aro mora
than three million cases of Illness annually
among Industrial -workers, caused mainly
by long hours, low wages, dust, bad ,alr
-fumes, 'umoke, poisonings nnd similar
causes, and that through typhoid fever and,
malaria alone, $900,000,000 annually is lost
to this nation enough to equip the largest
army and navy In the world, and then have,
a. balanco sufficient to pay the tuition of
every American boy now In college.
MORE RESULTS EXPECTED
"Information and reports received by the
A. F. of L. clearly demonstrate the fact
that a labor famine' exists only -where em
ployers still demand long hours ' at low
wages and where they Ignore, the living
standards set by the workers.
"Labor has successfully fought long
hours and low. wages In tlie last year, and
shall obtain more results In the year to
come.
"Our biggest present work is to curb Im
migration and obtain more freedom of aa
tlon." NEW LAWS PLANNED
A complete new code of laws to goyera
the railroads of 'the country la to be co.
sldered by Congress, at the short session ,
which begins in December. A thorough In
vestigation of the present projected an4
needed Federal legislation regarding inter
state commerce will be begun at once by
the recently created Joint congressional
committee on the subject. Senator New
lands, chairman of the, J,olnt committee, sa!4
.today that work would begin Immediately
nfter the adjournment of Congress, expect
ed by Thursday.
"The joint subcommittee named t
study the railroad situation," Bald Senator
Newlands, "has already organized and will
begin its Investigations at once. The com
mittee will continue to work throughout
the recess of Congress and will endeavor
to submit a report as soon as Congress re
convenes In December, Of course the com
mittee will consider legislation necessary t
prevent a recurrence of the strike crista
just averted. The legislation passed p'n
Saturday deals with only a part of th
problem and was put through as an emer
gency measure. The committee -will g
over the entire railroad labor situation a
welt as other branches of l,he subject"
Under the laj signed by President Wil
son yesterday, the legal eight-hour day
nay basis on railroads does not become
effective until January I, 1917. and befer
that date Congress may have before tt .
complete revision of the railroad law of
the country.
It is certain that the hearings of th
joint committee wU be seized, upon as an
opportunity for airing the entire egWr"
hour day controversy, wjtb the railroads,
the labor organizations and the ahijpr
of the country participating. Up to' UaU
the railroad representatives In WasJuBfi
ton have sought to postpone the opening
of the investigation, but they are exriKrtaf :
to aid in expediting the hearings asa tm$ I
