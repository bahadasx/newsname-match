STRIKERS HAVE LITTLE
HOPE OF OUTSIDE HELP
New Wage-Scale But No Rec
ognition of Unionists is
Attitude Expected
. v Announcement that Honolulu em
ployers of waterfront labor, are pre
pared to effect a new wage-scale for
longshoremen may be made within the
next 24 hours.
This, D1 106 fact tnat tnere 18
steady supply of! labor available under
the existing scale, with the result
that the strike has failed to tie up
cargo-handling, are among the devel
opments of the day in the waterfront
strike. -' ' ' : .. "
This matter of an increase in the
wage-scale is known to have been un
der discussion1 for several days past
and there were reports in waterfront
circles this morning ' that a meeting
ri -shippers and advisers had been
Veld to complete discussion and agree
' bent, . so far as the local interests
are concerted But. there are several
San Francisco officers, In some cases
head, of steamship and other com
panies affected whoso consent' must
be gained, and the best Information
obtainable is that up to a late hour
today the desired and expected infor
mation had not. come from the coast.
Rumor differ! as to what the new
wage-scale is likely to be. The report
most generally believed is that local
men favor 30 cents an , hour for a
' nine-hour day, with 40r 45 cents for
overtime, Sundays and holidays
' It is certain that. the employers of
. waterfront labor are not negotiating
, nor intending to negotiate with the
strikers through any committee or
1 .anIzation, ,-The, probability is that
- Vja new scale via IeciSd rponyUbej
employers will V give - no '.' notification
whatever to the new union, but 'will
.- simply put the Increase Into - effect
perhaps with a statement for the bene-
fit of the public, and such unionists
or strikers as seek employment and
are taken will come under the new
terms. In other words, the employ-
ers are not recognizing the union nor
spokesmen on behalf of the strikers
as an organization. ,
Shipping and other transportation
men, commenting upon the water
v front situation today, declared that
as soon as the police got some organ
'''" Ized patrolling into effect and were
prepared to stand their ground In the
face of mobs, the rowdyism ceased,
and there were no more exhibitions
of attempts to wreck or derail trains.
They are also inclined to attribute
; some of the apparent discouragement
of the strikers to the fact that news
was published this morning that, the
longshoremen's strike In Seattle had
f collapsed. The strikers here now
lave little hope, apparently, of get
.ting assistance from mainland unions.
Two new developments today in the
union's end of the stevedores' strike
are of significance in relation to the
Keneral situation.
Brtckons to Succeed Edwardson
The first one is that Attorney Rob
ert W. Breckons, former U. S. district
attorney and now counsel for several
btrlkfrs arrested yesterday and Tues
day by the police ;for alleged activity
In the riots at Pier 19, will be named
as a member of the union's arbitration
committee, to succeed Jack Edward
son, who resigned yesterday because
of disgust with the strikers' tactics cf
" violence and force, to which he has
- , been consistently opposed since the
strike began. . .j. v.; '
Agitator Returns to Coast .'.
Second in importance but neverthe
less significant is the statement to
day by members of Honolulu Local No.
r.S S,- International , Longshoremen's
Association. that- on the Matson
;'.'' steamer Wilhelmina yesterday an or
ganizer sent here by the San Fran
" Cisco Riggers and Stevedores' Union
to take charge of strike activities cf
the Union stevedores here, left for
7 San Francisco, returning to report to
V San Francisco . headquarters the re
sults of bis work here, '
Organizer Was In Htlo
'Union officials said today that after
this union organizer, whose name
.jlhey would not give out, as they said
L)ie had requested them not to make
' at public, reaches San Francisco, his
report will undoubtedly decide whether
the Ban Francisco union will aid the
Honolulu local - by declaring cargoes
loaded " here by non-union strike
breakers unfair and refuse to. dis
charge them at the coast.
This organizer was in Honolulu
more than a month. He came on the
Wilhelmina, according to union men,
on August 29, and after completing or
V sanitation of the local stevedores'
union left for Hilo, where he looked
over the field in that port. Whether
he tried to organize a union there is
net known, but at any rate no trouble
. has been experienced at Hilo to date.

COVS THAT HAVE
KEPT IN HERD
Territorial Veterinarian A Re
ports.; Dairymen Will mi;
; Remove Diseased Cattle 5
tn a report to the "board of agricul
ture and forestry on "Bovine Tuber
culosis ' Control,: and dated Septem
ber 20, Victor A. Norgaard, territorial
veterlnarlaii, takea up the matter of
the refusal' by the owner of dairy
cows that have been pronounced tu
bercular to have the animals killed or
even removed from the dairy. In part
his report says: , '; vv
"I beg to call attention to tne ap
Dended reDort of the assistant territo
rial veterinarian In regard to the last
tuberculin test ori the Kuliouou lands
belonging to Mr. Charles Belllna. Six
teen cows reacted to the test and, as
stated In this report. Sir. Belllna re
fused to remove them from the herd.
Under these circumstances letters
were addressed to the president of
the board of health and to the city
and county physician of Honolulu, res
pectively, calling attention to the fact
that the condition referred to appear
ed to be an infringement -on both the
sanitary code of the board of health
and the municipal milk ordinance.
These two regulations require that all
dairy cattle must be tuberculin test
ed, and classify as "adulterated" milk
from tuberculous, cows or from cows
recently exposed to an Infectious or
transmissible disease' i
Process Destroys Germs
Mr. Belllna delivers his milk to
the Honolulu Dairymen's Association
and the fact that this association has
installed up-to-date pasteurising ma
chinery does not seem to me to war
rantMr. Bellina's disregard - of the
said ordinances, both of which aim at
keeping the dairies free from "Infec
tious and contagious diseases, but say
(nothing about treating the milk for
contamination.
"In my opinion pasteurization, under
efficient and official control, may be
relied upon to destroy the tubercle
bacteria In milk, but in view of the
fact that this board has endeavored
for the past six years to eradicate
bovine tuberculosis, and has succeed
ed In so far as SO to 90 per cent of
the local dairy herds are concerned,
it would seem this time were ill cho
sen for setting aside this policy and
resorting to pasteurization. It would.
in fact, be a great injustice to the
many' dairymen who have cleaned
their herds of tuberculous animals at
great expense,; and who are constant
ly endeavoring to keep disease out of
their herds, as experience has fully
proven that tuberculous cattle , on
neighboring premises are very , likely
to transmit the disease to the clean
herds surrounding them.
"What action the territorial board of
health and the municipal authorities
will take in the matter remains to be
seen and until decided upon it would.
in my opinion, be well for this board
to defer further action."
Inquiry at the office of the health
department elicited the information
that such department had received a
letter similar to the one sent to the
board of agriculture and forestry, that
since Its receipt there had been no
meeting of the health board and that
there probably would be such a meet
ing in a week or ten days.
Open house will be kept from 3 until
5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon at Ka
waiahao sem'nary, Manoa Valley,
when the members of the faculty will
be at home to their friends.

TO LEPER COLONY
Maui Resident Upholds Stand
Taken By Star-Bulletin and
Adds Reasons
SAYS AGITATION IS
DETRIMENT TO INMATES
Dr. Raymond's Republican Op
ponent, H. A. Baldwin, Said to
Have Declined Opportunity
That political campaigning in the
leper settlement at Molokai, begun
now after a cessation of eight year3.
will be a seriously detrimental thing
to the inmates is the declaration con
tained in a letter to the Star-Bulletin
from a prominent resident of Maui
and one familiar with conditions at the
settlement.
This citizen, who requsts that bis
name te not used, praises a recent
editorial in the Star-Bulletin which
criticised the decision of the terri
torial board of health to allow politi
cal campaigning In the leper settle-
inent.
"Your reasons for criticising the
action of the board of health are all
well founded and to the point," he
writes. He says that in past years
the campaigning created much dis
cord among the Inmates and that for
their welfare candidates should keep;
out of the settlement."
oN criticism is made of the candi
dates who are going to campaign on
this part of Molokai, hut it is empha
sized that deleterious results of the
excited debates and stump speeches
are apparent ; in the settlement for
months after the elections are over.
It was at the instance of Dr. J. II.
Ilaymond, who is a, candidate for the
senate, that the board , of health re
versed its , attitude maintained j for
eight year and decided to allow candl-
riatea In bA,RPtt!Ampnt. It- Ifl' Said

clined to go to the leper settlement

campaigning is wise there.

Taylor Outlines Plans .
Engineer Taylor outlined the plans
today In " a comprehensive manner.
He said the cost of the project will be
about $33,000, but that this will take
in water from atcatchment area of
125 acres in one portion and 175 acres
In another. He also stated that the
cost is much less than any other pro
position for getting water from neigh
boring areas.
The general speed of the stream in
the ditch and tunnel will be less than
three feet a second, which will be a
safe rate of flow. The maximum ca
pacity of the -plan will be 24,000,000
gallons a day. Taylor pointed out
that in future years; if need arise,
Kalihi can also be tapped from this
project without much expenditure of
money.

ers interested in the project will be

Campbell Notifies Attorney
One of the features of the meeting
was a brief letter from Marston
Campbell acknowledging receipt of
the letter which stated that his bill
for work In Nuuanu valley Is disal
lowed. Campbell informed the board
that he has placed the matter in the
bands of his attorney. The letter was
filed by the commission.
. Taylor's bill of $33 for auto hire on
his own ' machine bobbed up again,
and will probably be paid, Engineer
Kirchoff being given the suggestion
to look over the matter and turn In a
repair- bill or something equally ef
fective. Taylor presented his claim
to the commission today.
"If I had put in a bill for John
Johnes, auto hire, it would have been
paid without question," he said. "It
is a small sum to me. of course, but
stjll I think it only fair to pay It."
Forbes thought so, too. but not un

would easily have been allowed twice
as much, he said.
