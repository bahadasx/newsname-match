CROP OF 11,637,000 BALES
CONDITION ON SEPTEMBER 2."
WAS 56.3 OF NORMAL.
Loss Due to Storms and Ravages of
Insects.?Government Figures
Given.
Washington, Oct. 2.?Storms and
insect damage have wrought havoc
with the cotton crop this year and
caused a loss of almost 3,000,000
hales throughout the growing season.
This year's crop will be approximately
11,637,000 equivalent 500
bales, according to the department of
agriculture's report, made public today.
It is the first forecast of production
made from conditions existing
since June 25, when the quantity
was estimated at 14,266,000 bales,
The condition of the crop on September
25 was 56.3 of a normal, which
is the lowest condition on record for
that time of the year.
Cotton this year was planted or
the fourth largest acreage ever record
pd?25.944.000 acres. In 1911
when 33,965,000 acres were planted
the crop was 15,693,000 bales; ir
1913, when there were 37,039,00C
acres, the crop was 14,156,000 bales
and in 1914, when the acreage was
36,832,000-, the crop amounted t(
16,135,000 bales.
Fewer Pounds to Acre.
Indications are that this crop wil
yield only 156.3 pounds per acr<
compared with 207.7 pounds in 1911
120.8 pounds in 1915, and 209.'
pounds in 1914.
In a statement issued today the re
porting board said:

ONLY SINGLE VOTE APART.
Catts and Knott Close in Guberna
torial Contest.
- Jacksonville, Fla., Sept. 28.?Bui
one vote separated W. V. Knott anc
Sidney J. Catts today in the contesi
for the. Democratic gubernatorial
nomination of Florida, according tc
figures announced by Knott head
quarters here today. The one vote
was in favor of Mr. Knott, who nov
holds the certificate of nominatior
as a result of the recanvass by the
State oanvassiner board last week
At that time Mr. Knott was declarec
entitled to the certificate of nomination,
which since June 6 had beer
held by Sdney J. Catts, by a lead 01
21 votes. Since that time furthei
recounts have been made to increase
Mr. Knott's lead, but it has been decreased.
These figures are based on the assumption
that Mr. Catts will secure
the 69 votes in Alachua precinct No
3, which were not counted for hirr
in the original count because the inspectors
failed to sign the returns
The vote for all other candidates except
those for governor were counted
and now that Catts is petitioning the
court that he be given credit fol
them it is expected that the vote will
be included in his total.
COST HAS ADVANCED.
Democrats Need Fund Nearly 50 Per
Cent. Greater Than in 1912.
New York, Sei)t. 29.?A fund of
$1,500,000 will be required to conduct
the Democratic national campaign,
according to a statement made
here tonight by Henry Morgenthau,
treasurer of the national campaign
committee. He declared New York
was expected to contribute about onethird
of this amount, which exceeded
v..- nKniit ^inn nnn tho cum snpnt in
V> auuui y 1 v v , w v ^z- ~ ? v, - ?
the 1912 campaign.
lYinting 200 Per Cent. Higher.
As an example of the increased
cost of the present campaign, Mr.
Morgenthau said that the printing
bill alone would be three times as
much as it was in 1912 because of
the increased price of paper. He announced
that contributions thus far
received exceeded by 5 per cent,
those which had been sent in up to
the same date in 1912. There have
been several contributions of $10,000
each, but only three of more than
that amount, he said.
SON KILLS HIS FATHER.
i
J. C. CrossweH Shot and Killed by
I Horace Crosswell.
McCormick, Sept. 28.?J. C. Crosswell,
aged 55, was shot and killed
this afternoon by his son, Horace,
aged 17.
From what can be learned the
father was in argument with his wife,
which came to a heated discussion,
when the younger Crosswell interceded
in behalf of his mother.
When the father turned on him he
is said to have grabbed a shotgun
and fired, the whole load taking effect
in the face of his father.
t Death was instantaneous.
Magistrate Holloway went immediately
to the scene and held an innuest.
the verdict being' that the man
met death by gunshot wounds at the
hands of Horace Crosswell.
Iilease Editor in Trouble.
i Greenville, Oct. 3.?Shortly after
federal court was convened this
morning, United States District Ati
torney J. William Thurmond handed
- an indictment to the grand jury
, against Victor B. Cheshire, editor of
, the Anderson Farmers' Tribune,
i charging the sending of obscene mat)
ter through the mails. This after,
noon the grand jury returned a true
3 bill. Cheshire was not present and
) a bench warrant, it was announced,
would be issued for his arrest.
The charge against Cheshire was
1 instituted by Postoffice Inspector
3 Curran, who took the matter up with
; the district attorney and directed
I that prosecution be started.
Some timfe ago Cheshire was up
- before the city recorder under a
charge of reckless driving, for which
1 he was fined. It is alleged that the
9 subject matter charged to be obscene
s grew out of an editorial criticising . ?
- the city officials and some of the
y most prominent members - of the
1 Greenville bar. j
A County Matter.
Washington, Oct. 2?Because the
j cattle tick always has been in the
j South is no reason why it always
j should be. When the federal government,
as a result of its investigaj
tions into the harm done by the pest,
a determined in 1906 to undertake the
a work of systematic eradication, its
first step was to quarantine the in- r
fested area. This territory included /?
at that time 728,543 square miles. It
has since been reduced to 444,022
- square miles and tens of thousands
of miles are being freed from quarantine
each year.
t It is obvious, therefore, that the
1 tick can be driven out. The process*
t is a simple one and its efficiency
1 proven. Regular dipping in arsenical
) baths of all the cattle in a county
- will put an end to the pest in the
> course of nno season This fact is in
r disputable. The lack of success in
1 some cases has invariably been due
j to conditions which have made dip.
ping irregular or incomplete. There
I are always some persons who, if left
- to themselves, will shirk their share
1 in the work and neglect to bring
f their cattle to tte vats. In some way
* these must be forced to do their part.
i Again, the number of vats may be
- too few to handle all the stock and
the consequent delays may seriously
- interfere with the progress of the
5 work. Such obstacles, however, al.
ways can be overcome. They do not
l affect the essential point that the
- tick can be eliminated whenever and
. wherever the people are determined
- to do so.
I Primarily tick eradication is a
} county matter ana must De accom
plished by county effort. The United
i States department of Agriculture,
however, stands ready to lend the
;
services of its trained men to any
county in which the people are sufficiently
in earnest in the matter to
>
build the necessary vats and enforce
the necesarv dfpping regulations. If
the people are not willing to do this,
it is useless to expect anything from
the federal men. They can only help
those who want to help themselves.
The first step, therefore, is to determine
whether the people really do
want the ticks to go. If they decide
they do, the federal inspectors will
supervise the construction of the
vats, the preparation of the baths and
the actual dipping of the cattle. They
will assist the local men in every
way within their power but they cannot
supply the money that the work
demands. As a matter of fact, however,
the amount required is not
large. In a number of counties
which are now free from quarantine,
tick eradication has been accomplished
at a cost of from 19 to 50
cents per head of cattle. As it is a
conservative estimate that cattle in
a tick-free County are worth $10 a
head more than in a ticky one, the
investment seems to be a sound one.
