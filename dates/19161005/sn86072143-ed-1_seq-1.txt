A lino of thin, ilcd by Judge Howe, wi

bottles of Palue's Celery Compound man
ulactured by the company In Burlington
fulled to comply with the pure food and
di ug acts.
Thp affairs of the Huston & Main"
railroad weie thoioughly aired during
aiRiinients which occupied the time of
Judge llarland B. Howe of St. Johns
bury for five hours this morning and
Tuesdaj afternoon and evening. They
had to do with a petition of tho Hoston
Minority Stockholders' association forl'ifh
light of Intervention In the t ecelvershlp
of the road and also with an applica
tion for tlie appointment of a co-receiver
In Vermont, to act with James H. Hustls
of Winchester, Mass., who is the present
temporary receiver. Martin A. Hrown of
Wilmington, a well known lumber dealer,
was mentioned by both Clark C. I'ltts
of Hrattlcboro, representing the Hrattlo-
boio Trust company, bond holders, ant!
Vetmont stockholders, and C. W. Crooker
of Hoston, attorney for the minority stock
holders, as acceptable for co-recolvcr,
but the court took the matter under ad
visement and did not make the appoint
ment. He Intimated this afternoon that
he did not favor the co-receiver.
Tho appointment of a co-receiver and
any movement looking to the discharge
of the present receiver was opposed by
Attorney W. H. C. Stlckney of Rutland,
and former Attorney-flenernl John C,
SarKcnt of I.udlow, counsel for Hustls.
.Mr Kltts argued this morning th.it
while Mr Hustls IihiI expert training In
lalltoad management his ideas and poli
cies were tixed and some other person
who could he 111 closer touch with the
situation could better look after tho
InteteslH nf stockholders hero In Ver
mont. Attorney Crooker, who i opt psents m,0iO
shaiPs of Mock, valued at f(l,0,'M Hint
owned by rosldonts nf Massachusetts,
New Hampshire and Maine, pointed o.it
the fact that the Hoston .t Malno has
J Id O.'M in cash and as its debts amount
lo only $11,(100,000 thoio should bo wrai
way of paying tho Indebtedness. Ho had
much to sn'y about mismanagement of
tho road and of schemes for tho alleiTort
defrauding of minority stockholders. Ho
sharply criticised the courts of Massa
chusetts, clalmlnR that his case had been
thrown there without proper hearing.
JuiIro Howo frenuently uuestioned 'ho
uttorne.ys and mado many suggestions
Ho pointed nut that tho. position tho man
held must Indicate that Mr. Hustls Is a
competent operator, Attorney Crooker ad
muting this, hut added that tho question
was not one of operation but one of finan
cing "It Is a banker's Job."
