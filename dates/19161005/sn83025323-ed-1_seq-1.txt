Republicans Have
Splendid Ticket
Republican Party Have Bunch Of Good
Candidates That Will Win Nov. 7
This week The Enterprise pub
lishes a full list of the republican
candidates, national, state and coun
ty and it is a list of men and women
that voters need have no hesitancy
in voting for as they are the very
best that could be selected regard
less of party and it is very essential
that each voter exercise his or her'
right at the polls November 7th.
There never was a time when a
change of administration both nat
ional and state was so badly needed
as this year, and with the reunited
republican party it will come with a
grand sweep. While we are clean
ing up old scores it will be just as
well to clean from township officers
We wish to call the attention of
the voters to the excellent list of
candidates for office on the republi
can ticket and think they deserve
the support of every republican:
The republicans are proud of their
candidate for state senator, Dr. Geo.
W. Clay. The doctor represented the
old county of Valley, both in the up
per and lower houses and was the
tireless: worker for anything that
would be of benefit to the people of
?oastern Montana. He is undloubted
iy the most popular candidate on
the ticket and will have no optposi
Lion at the polls. HIe has always
been a strong party worker and is
deserving of the support of every
loyal republican.
We are indeed fortunate in having
a man like Dudley Jones as a candi
date for representative and it is an
assured fact that he will quit himself
with credit in the house. He has
been a resident of this section of the
county for years and knows every
seed of the voters. He was at one
time one of the big ranchers of the
west part of this county, and today
is extensively engaged in farming.
-He is a man that can be trusted to
look after the interests of the tax
payers at Helena this winter. He will

1a. M. TRAI'TFON EIXPItAINS HIS
POSIrTON ON COURT HOUSE
E.ditor Malta Enterprise:
As it seems we are unfortunately
to have a (curt house location war
thrust un1cn our little town, a few
words fr.in me as to the facts in,
the case may not come amiss at this
inime.
To begin with, I deplore this agi
tation. and Ithink the men who
started it were ill advised, and have
not the good of their town at heart
vo attempt to line up this entire com
munity in a factional fight and stir
up all the ill will and bitterness that
goes with such a fight is not the
I best way to build up our little town,
and certainly will do more harm
and injury than all the Commercial
clubs in christendom can ever make
right. When the court house loca
tion was talked of, I had sixteen
lots in Block seven, that were of
fered tile comissioners by me for
OO5500. Other parties owned the re
Inaining four lots in this block: and
these were offered at $4000, making
the total cost of the block to the
taxpayers of Phillips county $9500.
At tie time we were getting sign
ers for the petition to form our new
county, the promise was made by
solme interested parties, among them
Liir. B. (). Phillips, that if county di
vision went through ,and Malta was
the coult.y seat, that a suitable block
:or a court house would be furnished
by the the citizens of Malta and free
of cost to the taxpayers. So when
the $9500 site was offered the com
missioners they began to hear about
the free site promise, for the sixteen
lots in block seven. I had made a
deed conveying them to Phillips
county, and the deed was held for
some three months awating their ac
tion. They did not wish to spend
the county money for this puprpose,
and took no action. Then as no one
else offered to do anything, I offered
them the whole of block nine for a
court house without one cent of cost,
and this offer they accepted and
there was no objection to their ac
tion at the time at least. I never
heard of any.
Now as to the location of block
nine. It is just two blocks west of
b:ock seven, altogether three and
one-half blocks from the postoffice,
and four blocks from the First State
Bank and Great Northern hotel. It
is as central as the court house at
Gl-;r:_;ow or Chinook and rnore cen
,.-o1 than the court house at Havre.
It is line, level land, and can lie
made into beautiful grounds. It is
nerous in size, tteing a full block
aunt aining 22 lots, and not a six-lot
'oti)ositionI.
"'ihe lmiii of a court house I have
" mind f'or Phillips county to build
,vould look pretty sick :l n i!x lots.
.'1I the tacke rs of block seven for
" curt houe!, offer whll I offer free
of cost, that is the entire of block
:ven as I ;tl'f'red the iietire of blockl
nilne. Then I will use all niv efforts
i) have Ile CCurti holiSC erected ion
lot(k seven, though to 1myv notion it
i not as suitable n loca cion as block
WI itte.
Application lihas been made to the
'i!ty engineer for water and sewer
'.'e to connect block nine with the
cit y system, so block nine, you
miight say, is right in thle heart of
hi city.
