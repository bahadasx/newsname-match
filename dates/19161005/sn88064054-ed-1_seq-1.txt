On behalf of the Commission Council and myself. I want to let
you know how much we appreciate the great complimeot you have
shown us by voting for the aid to public sohools and the bond issue
almost unanimously.
It is our purpose to handle the expenditure of this money by
commissions to take charge of each fund. Within a very short time
either one general mass meeting will be held or perhaps meetings in
different sections of the city, so that you may select representatives
from your section to act on each of the commissions.
It is our purpose to see that the City of Bogalusa gets full value
for every dollar that you have voted, and we certainly will try to
show you, by the way in which the money is expended and the re
sults we get, that we fully anpreciate the great confidence you seem
to have in your city Government.
Yours truly,
W. II. SULLIVAN,

can go to Covington without fear Uo
of getting "stuck" in the mud a few
miles below Bogalusa as a result of
the fund raised by the Enterprise
through the suggestion of Chas.
Webster the well known real estate us
dealer. Only those who have been of
forced to remain in the holes for
several hours can appreciate what
it means to those who desire to
make the trip to Covington. While th
the work which has been done is Gi
only temporary it will result in the %
road being passable until the entire to
road is placed in good condition. ai
The work was ordered m view of SI
the fact that the Pathfinders of the bi
Jackson Highway will pass through tl
Bogalusa, enroute to New Orleans N
tomorrow or Saturday and if they d
were forced to cross this place in its cl
past condition, Bogalusa would stand
no chance of being on the great
Jackson Highway.
