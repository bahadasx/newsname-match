H.J. Rossi Begins

Titanic, and the drowning of internationally famous
men and women, was of no more importance to the
world in general than is the trial of Herman J. Rossi,
1 which began today, to the mountainous mining coun
»try which walls in this little metropolis of eastern Idaho.
Rossi, one of the state's most prominent men,
twice mayor of Wallace, a statewide politician, inter
ested extensively in several mines, and member of five
fraternal organizations, stands accused of the murder
of Clarence Dalquist, a Wallace musician and insur
ance solicitor, in the lobby of the Samuels hotel, here
j June }0.
Not since the Moyer-Pettibone-Haywood case has
the interest of Idaho been so aroused as it is today,
while the stage is being set for what promises to be
a rare court drama.
One of the star roles in this drama probably will
, be played by the pretty and vivacious young wife of
1 Rossi. The defense will seek to prove that it was for her
