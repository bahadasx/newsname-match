who have been joined by Sir Edward
Carson.
Sir Edward asserts that the situa
tion is such that without conscription
In Ireland, it will be impossible to
even maintain the Irish regiments at
the front in their proper stre-ngth. He
contends that Ireland could provide
mother half million men of military
age, and asks what the colonies, which
have made such sacrifices for the em
pire, w 111 think of the shirking of Ire
land While most of the politicians are
agreed that It would be inexpedient to
i'tterrpt to apply compulsion to Ireland
while home rule Is witnheld from it,
vtindoubtedly in the present phase, of
the war those who are demamling
conscription hold a strong hand and
the government may find it difficult
to resist their demand.
The nationalists, in reply to Sir Ed
ward Carson, point out that the col
onies already have self government
and hence there Is no analogy with
the position of Ireland. They assert
that Ireland will be found to be a
united nation In resistence to compul
sion.
The liberal newspapers consider the
agitation of another attempt to unsea
Premier Asqulth and contend that
while compulsion in Ireland would
provide a few men It would provoke
another clash In the Irish country.

like to know that of the republican

"I believe intervention by the gov

foreign policy. He also turned his at
tention to President Wilson's defense
of his course in settling the threat
ened railroad strike through the en
actment of the Adamson law.
'Corporations and trade unions are
necessities of modern economic
Becuntr
" said Mr. Taft. "The
power they acquire, however, mav
tempt them to serious abuse, and they
have done so. Hence the anti-trust
law and the interstate commerce law.
Labor leaders have sought exemption
from puch a law and in some instanc
es they have been successful. Unwise-
subserviency to the demands of
labor leaders finis iLs crowning in
stance in Mr. Wilson's dealing with
the threatened strike of the railroad
brotherhoods.
"It was one of the greatest national
humiliations to which the people of
this country have been subjected. Mr.
Wilson's defense is that he acted in
behalf of humanity and of society,
but this defense is palpably disin
genuous and confirms the just infer-
ience that what moved him chiefly was
to secure votes and that the real in
terests of the country had but lit'le
effect.
"Mr. AVilson cannot shift blame for
his blunders in Mexico. He had a
clean slate upon which lo write when
he came in.
'Mr Hughes is a man whose
avowed opinions always have been
the guide of his actions. Having in
view Mr. Wilson's record on nearly
every political question and Mr.
Hughes' course as governor of Ne'.v
York, it would tie difficult to find
among the public one who is less like
Mr. Wilson than Mr. Hughes."

today from Los Angeles and leaves
tomorrow for Portland.
"You have done yourselves honor
hy nominating Governor Johnson," he
said. It is important that you rot
only elect Charles Evans Hughes, but
that you send a republican congress to
Wafhington to support him."
Once in the course of his speech,
the nominee sought for a word to
describe the divisions of the republi
can party. "No. I wont say factions."
he said, "for factionalism in the re
publican party is buried."

ENTENTE PROTESTS
AGAINST CAP.RANZA
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3. Strong pro
test has been made to the state depart
ment by the British and French em
bassies against the action of the Car
ranza government in Mexico in seizing
the assets of British and French bank
ing institutions in the Mexican capital.
These banks ttre closed as the result
of the Carranza decree and it is de
clared that the interests of British and
French stockholders have been seri
ously affected.
So far the state department lias
given no indication of what it will do.
but it is believed that the protests will
be transmitted first to the American
members of the joint commission now
in session at Atlantic City to be drawn
to the attention of their Mexican col
leagues. ' for us to maintain this attitude unto
the end."
Thus, in effect, said Prime Minister
Dr. K. H. L. Hammarskjold, of Sweden,
to the correspondent of the Associated
Press in the only interview he has
granted any foreign journalist since
the war began.
Throughout the interview the pre
mier continued to lay stress on hij
government's desire to follow unswer
ingly the policy ot unpartlsanship thus
far followed.
"And when you g?t to know th
Swedes better you will. I think, find
that when thev say or promise a thing
they mean it," said the minister.
