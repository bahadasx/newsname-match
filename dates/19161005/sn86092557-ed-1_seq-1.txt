If : desired by the railroaders, and cm?.
pfiaslzlng the need of a substantial
- . protective tariff to avert disaster to
.?=>,. t American Industries when the crash
'which will follow the close of the
war In Europe comes. Hon. Henry W.
Temple In an able and eloquent adp;'
dress yesterday evening roused the
"r. Mannlngton voters who attended the
??. ; rally, to enthusiastic applause.
<V;. The street In front of the Bartlett
Hgi hotel, from which Congressman Temple
spoke, was crowded with both Republicans
and Democrats from Mannlngton
and all parts of the county
who were attracted by the prominence
of the distinguished speaker. The
Elks band of Mannlngton rendered a
concert before the meeting and Res'!
publican Committeeman George W.
i Bowers, of Mannlngton. presided. Congressman
Temple came to Fairmont
. today and visited at local headquarters.
Tonight he will go to Sblnnston
to address a rally of Harrison
county voters.
\ . The failure of the President's policy
$ to keep the country from war was the
first of the three points made by Mr.
S -Temple concerning this he said:
- . "The vacillating, uncertain, timid
f'- policies of President Wilson have done
more u> piunge us iniu me dangers ot
?- 'war than all ot the other difficulties
f'-' that hare arisen during the four years
of his administration. Words carry
J "*tNm ?-'ir*-' whan the world learns.
that those words mean nothing. Scolding
notes irritate more than firm, quiet
notion."
? : The speaker bitterly assailed the
administration for ltB policy toward
V - - -Mexico which he summed up as a "de??
(r termination to drive Huecta out even
, if the United States had to be Involved
>7; in war to do it."
i In exposing the failure of the Ad.
amson bill to give the railroaders an
ir eight-hour day after the expiration of
the commissions 3 days he said:
. "Whatever they have got in the
eight-hour law?I think myself it's a
gold brick?that is secured. Do either
? railroad employers or railroaders and
L other labor mon want the rest of th"
" program? The President lias warned
f us that the rest ot the program must
> go through. 1 don't think you want
. enforcement of compulsory arbitration
. - of the double type and when the real
v , nature of the Adamson law is under
stood, it won't get many votes for Mr.
?jj>ypnson."
gj;' Mr. Temple is a strong advocate of
-V the eight-hour day and delivered an
Tv address in Congress In favor of civ -+
lag the railroad workers a fair adjust1
' ment.
jj Concerning the need of a protective
j- tarlft to avert the industrial depres.
slon that is sure to come after tho
$ European war Is ended, Mr. Temple
It v? said further:
' "Business Is good, mills are running
ffijvand factories are paying good wages
^Actual war Supply trade is small, 'tis
jwtrue, but the bulk of onr big trade with
.'V foreign countries now Is due to the
\fact that foreign countries are not
> .'.making those goods. When the war
BSv.vla over there will be an awful scram,->
ble in Europe to regain lost trade.
The effect on the United Statos will
C-~ be very noticeable.
"If we need protection in normal
.-. Unies, we'll need it double when thin
,7-' ".war ends. The crash that follows the
7 wars of 1792 to 1816 because wo did
' > "got have a party in power that heliev?
" ?d in protection principles of the Republican
party to guard against it. We

BY CHARLES BROOKS SMITH
WASHINGTON. I). OcL 5.?Un-j
less present plans miscarry. President
Wilson Is going to make a speech In
West Virginia. His side partner in
the deal to hook the labor vote, Sam
> Uompers, Is also going to invade West
Virginia along about a week after
1 next. If the plans miscarry as to
Gompers. It will be because those who
are in charge of the Demlcratic campaign
In West Virginia will have de,
cided that It Is best to keep Gompers
out They are massaging their minds
with that question now.
When and where Wilson will speak
In West Virginia is yet to be determined.
It Is probably that he will
make a stop In the state when he Is
r en route to or on his way back east
l from ClnclnnaU, where be Is billed
r for the 26tb. Unless be changes his
i mind, and that Is not at all lmprobI
able in his case, an occasion will have
- to be provided for him. as well as an
- organization, which will, on the face
l of It at least, conform to bis announcI
ed purpose to address only "non-par
tisan" gatherings during the cami
palgn.
I It Is the understanding among
Democrats fro mthe state who are
i In the city at the present time, that,
if it Is possible, the speech of the
' president will be booked for some
> place in the First District, probably
at Wheeling. National Commltteei
man Watson. It Is the talk here, wants
> the President's piece to be staged In
? that? district, and < Representative
I Neely, who Is playing to the organlzf
dd labor element as earnestly, but as
quietly as possible, so as not to ruffle
a considerable part of the voting pop
ulatlon in tbat district wbo do not
1 think that organized labor is every1
thing. National Committeeman Wat
son and his business associates proml
nently among them, is as keen as a
1 briar to have the Wilson speech pulled
off in the district where Democratic
prospect at the present time are reported
here to be none too flattering.
As to Gompers going into West Virginia
that is tentative as yet. A feelL
er has been put out to ascertain if
Gompers would do more harm In West
Virginia than he Alight do good for
the Wilson ticket. Some there are who
figure that his presence on the stump
would be decidedly embarrassing to
National Committeeman Watson and
his candidate, Mr. Cornwell, both (9
Ing anything but enamored of the
. movement with which Gompers is connected.
Their records are clear-cut in
, opposition to organized labor. Mr.
Watson, in his coal fields, and Mr.
Cornwell in his erstwhile capacity as
policy attorney for the Baltimore and
i Ohio Railroad company. It Is pointi
ed out, too. that the voters of West
Virginia are in the main conservative
. as a class and Gompers' extreme radiallsm
and one-mindedness on one
question is liable to have an effect
i not desired by the party which is fea|
turtng him on the stump this year,
i Also, it Is referred to In connection
I with Gompers' proposed stumping tour
! of the State that he made a number of
| speeches in Maine which gained votes
] for the Republican ticket wherever
I ho spoke or his speeches were pubf
lishqd.
j Another thing, it is claimed by some
! that Gonipers is not popular with or!
fw*l It J -roil lolinr l? Vl'ool 1 11 '
11 vol IIISIIIW; IIIUI
! there he has long ago lost the confl|
dcnce of not only many of the leaders
in the movement, but also many of the
more intelligent and politically perspicacious
men in the ranks. They
long ago "took Gompers' measure,"
as one of their leaders has expressed
it. and the same man added that
! Gompers had only succeeded in holding
the job he has as long as he has
because of Ills tearful appeals not to
be thrown out in his old age which
have up till now had the effect as
planned on the sympathy of the voting
power in the organization.
The consent of the Democratic National
committee to stage a Wilson
speech in West Virginia was secured
by the campaign managers in the
state upon their representing that Governor
Hughes was hilled to make a
day's tour of the state, and that ColnnA1
nnnsovoH n-miU 1
I ? nv?m iuiiuw imniifS
soon thereafter. It van also reprenented
with great emphasis to the national
managers that Wilson has more
than a fighting chance to capture the
electoral votes of the state. This representation
does not accord with the
opinion of these gentlemen when privately
expressed to friends, but they
had to make that argument strong.
What Is behind it. of course, Is the
expectation that a speech from Wilson
in West Virginia will accrue to
the benefit of Mr. Watson's gubernatorial
candidate, Mr. Cornwall. Everything
is being turned to the account
of Cornwall, is the understanding of
the State colony of politicians in the
Capital, even to getting the National
committee to atop the Wilson special
long enough In-West .Virginia to got
a speech ffnui the President.

Democrats Seeking Power
With Unsound but Alluring
Pleas.
TRENTON, N. J., Oct. 6?Declaring
that the campaign ot 1916 la as
Important aa the campaign ot 1898
and resembles that campaign in that
the Democratic party and ita candidate
are seeking a vote of power tor
disingenuous, unsound, but alluring
reason, William H. Tart,-former President
ot the United States, delivered
the opening address of the Republican
campaign here last night Mr.
Taft assailed the Democratic party's
fiscal policy, its extravagance, its free
trade tarilT, its claim to credit for
prosperity and its foreign policy, and
he made a direct reply to President
Wilson's defense of his course in settling
the threatened railroad strike
through the enactment of the Adamson
Law.
Mr. Taft said. In part:
The great public advantage in organization
and combination of capital
and ot wage-earners we all recognize.
The one vastly increase the product
ot human enterprise and energy, the
other puts the wage-earner on an equality
with his employer In dealing
with wages and the teams of his employment.
Corporations and tradesunions
are therefore neccssltes ot mod
ern economic society that are permanent
and necessary. The power they
acquire may. however, become so
great as to tempt to serious abuse
and public injury, and they have lone
so. Hence we have had the anti-trust
an niKi (.lie nuciniaic cuiuiiiuicc law.
directed chiefly acninst combinatlonn
of capital but effecting In some measures
combinations of labor. Labor
leaders have sought exemption from
such laws as a privileged class, and
in some cases they have been Buccess- i
ful. While Mr. Wilson in one of his ,
memorandums attached to an appro
priatlon bill avowed his opposition to I
such class legislation, he united with
the Democratic Congress in passing, 1

Jury Renders Verdict ol
Not Guilty Against Mingo
Citizens.
HUNTINGTON. W. Va., Oct. 6.A
Jury in the Federal Court here re
turned a verdict of not guilty in tht
case ot 11 residents of War Eagle
precinct. Mingo county, indicted foi
fraud in connection with the Congres
sional election of 1914.
The verdict was returned after the
jurors had deliberated for four hours
The verdict acquitting Oreenway Hat
field. Sheriff of Mingo county, was re
turned under the instruction of Judge
C. A. Woods of the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, before whon
the case was tried. The case as tc
the other defendants In the famoue
War Eagle precinct election conspir
acy case was.left in the hands ot the
Jury. The case reached the Jnry al
10:45 yesterday rooming after an ex
haustlve charge had been delivered bj
the court. There was no flurry in tht
courtroom when the verdict was an
nounccd. District Attorney William
G. Barahart asked that the jury be
polled, and each man in turn assentec
to the verdict as rendered.
The attention ot the court turned
immediately tn the trial nf what i.
known as tbe Rock House preclncl
election conspiracy case, in which
Grecnway Hatfield and others arc
named as defendants In the indict
ment. A jury was empanelled in this
case late in tbe day and opening arguments
were presented by Senatoi
D. E. French for the Government, and
John S. Marcum for tbe defense. An
effort is to he made to conclude the
trial of tbe case before tbe end of the
week.
In charging the jury In the War Eagle
case Judge Woods Instructed the
lurors that aside from finding a motive
for tbe alleged offense, politics
had nothing to do with tbeir consideration.
In arriving at Its verdict the Jury
cast aside as unworthy of credibility
the evidence of Noah Lester and Linko
Blankenshlp. defendants in the
War Eagle Indictments, who had en'
tered piers of guilty and testified as
ritneses for the Government.
They told a story of a meeting on
the night before the election, November
13, 1914. which they said was held
it the home of Tom Maynard. one o(
the defendants at which It was arranged
to seize the election precinct at
War Eagle on the following morning,
irganlze it against the regularly appointed
officials and admit them, Lester
and Blakenshlp, for the Democrats.
They state that the agreement was
parried out and that they and others
)t the defendants burned ballots cast
igalnst the Republican ticket and subitltuted
others marked by the election
ifflcers- and cast other votes In the
lames of registered citizens who did
lot appear at the polls. The defense
ivaa based largely on the Impeachment
if these witnesses and of Mrs. Noah
Lester, whose testimony was to some
legrea corroborative of theirs.
