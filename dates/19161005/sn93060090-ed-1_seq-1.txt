' We Wish To Say. to the read
?rs of the World's Cresset
that we are pleased to have the
priviledge of anouncing the
name of Hon. Argus Cox of
Springfield as a candidate for
Judge of the Springfield Court
of Appeals on the Republican
"Ticket. And we must say that
we do not know of any man
with higher ideals, or more pure
motives than Hon. Argus Cox,
we have known him ns a Lawyer
-and of his judgeship for many
years. And as a minister of
thf Gospel, we try to observe
the principles set forth l.y men
who sit upon the bench, inorder
to meet out justice to those
whom justice belongs to. And
fo this reason we believe who
ever casts - their vote for Hon.
Argus Cox, will cast their vote
for a man worthy of their sup-
port, Rev, L. S. Garrett,
