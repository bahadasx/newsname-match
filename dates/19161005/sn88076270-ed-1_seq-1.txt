SERIES FOR WHO'S
Mil WOW
BOSTON FOR AMERICAN, PROB
ABLY BROOKLYN FOR NA
TIONAL—BEGINS OCT. 7
Interest never lags in what Ring
Lardner terms the world's "serious.
Even the man who scarcely glances
at the per centage columns of the
big leagues during the summer begins
to take notice and make infuiries of
his better posted neighbor as Sep
tember draws to a close and is found
elbowing his way into the mob before
the bulletin board while the great
sporting classic is in progress.
The finish in both the American and
National leagues is one of the closest
Says
ossible this year. Not until a few
ago did the Boston "Red Sox"
cinch their title to American league
pennant and at this writing the Na
tional title is unsettled.
The Brooklyn "Trolley Dodgers"
have a slight lead but Pat Moran's
"Phillies" are close at their heels.
The Boston teams have won more
honors in world's series than those of
any other city. The twelve struggles
between the two leagues have left the
count so even that each new series
contains a large element of doubt that
puts the friends of each league on
their sporting mettle. Generally,
however, the favorite picked by the
talent has landed the big honor.
A high base ball authority, Grant
land Rice, has the following to say
of the coming series, which has been
announced to start Oct. 7:
In coming to the thirteenth world
series there are a number of elements
of surpassing interest beyond the
present rivalry.
How many ecstatic fanatics, we
wonder, appreciate the even play of
the two leagues for their last 12 meet
ings?
Offhand, one would figure that the
American league was far in front. For
the fan forgets quickly. He is not
likely to range back over six years,
and in doing so he remembers well
enough that the American league has
bagged five of the last 4fx trophies.
The Even Count
So far as series go, the young
league is out in front, as it has land
ed seven championships against five.
But so far as games go nothing
could be closer. For the two circuits
have played 70 world series games
since 1903. Of this number the Amer
ican league has won 34, the National
league nas won 34 and there have
been two ties.
If this isn't a nip-and-tuck count
over a 12-year war the proper answer
would be very much appreciated
around these precincts.
You hear considerable gossip about
world series upsets, but they have
been far apart.
In fact, there were only three of
any note within 12 years. The first
came when the White Sox, in 1906,
beat the great Cub machine four
games out of six.
The next came when the young
Mackian machine beat the Cubs four
games out of five.
The, third arrived when the inspired
and frenzied Braves beat the Mack
men four straight in 1914.
Boston's Triumph
Boston is the one undefeated world
series camp. No Boston club has ever
suffered a post-season setback. No
Boston fan from 1903 on has ever had
to alibi a loser.
The Boston Americans beat Pitts
burgh in 1903. The Boston Ameri
cans beat the Giants in 1912 and the
Phillies in 1915. And the Boston
Braves beat the Mackmen in 1914.
So Boston has four world series
triumphs, and Boston has been the
ruling city of the game three of the
last four years.
Here is the world series standing,
by cities:
City Won Lost Pet.
Boston 4 0 1.000
Chicago 3 2 .600
Philadelphia 3 3 .500
Pittsburgh 1 1 .500
New York 1 3 .250
Detroit 0 3 .000
One peculiar feature of this stand
ing is that McGraw and Jennings, two
great managers and two hard fight
ers, despite a Mathewson and a Cobb,
have won only one out of six world
series starts.
THE SLAVE PROBLEM
The slave trade in America and
slavery as it existed prior to the war
is exemplified in The Birth Of A Na
tion, D. W. Griffith's principal and
musical elaboration of Thomas Dixon's
"The Clansman" and "The Leopard's
Spots."
As a sort of prologue to the drama,
the arriva 1 of the first 'cargo' of
slaves is presented with historic fi
delity. From this the scene, changes
to ante bellum days, depicting the
condition of the negro in the south
at that time. Then comes the tur
moil of war, and, finally, the rule of
black over white and with a mulatto
lieutenant governor in the Capitol of
South Carolina and the Ku Klux Klan
riding through the Country-side to
rescue their women and preserve their
traditions.
Lincoln signing the Emancipation
proclamation is a favorite among the
5000 old scenes of the mighty spec
t&ClCe
If you see The Birth Of A Nation
when it appears here Oct. 17 and 18
at the Armory with the negro prob
lem in America in mind, as well as
the manifold other particular fea
tures, you will marvel at what you
behold.
Williston Invention
Established Success
The Zeno valve silencer, invented
by Zeno A. Bruegger, for many years
a Williston automobile machinist, is
now recognized as an established suc
cess and has taken its place among
the numerous automobile accessories.
Mr. Bruegger, who formerly was
proprietor of an automobile repair
shop on First avenue east, went to
Cincinnati last summer after he had
perfected his invention and succeed
ed in interesting several automobile
.merf. After sample sets had been
manufactured and tested on several
cars, Cincinnati experts become con
vinced that the device was practical
and would accomplish the purpose for
which it was intended, which is to re
duce the noise of motor valves. One
of the largest garages in Cincinnati
has given Mr. Bruegger its order for
six hundred sets of the silencers.
Mr. Bruegger recently returned to
Williston. to close up his business af
fairs and returned with his family to
Cincinnati last Sunday to give his
whole attention to the manufacture
and sale of his invention. A set of
eight .silencers, which is the number
required to fit out a four cylinder car,
sells for $3.
While here Mr. Bruegger received
an order from the Kuboske garage.
Methodist Ladies
Aid Elects Officers
On Thursday last the Ladies Aid
Society of the Methodist church were
entertained at the Methodist Parson
age with Mesdames Harriss, Taylor
and Grube as hostesses.
There were 115 present, at which
time they elected the following as of
ficers for the ensuing year:
President, Mrs. R. Slater.
Vice Pres., Mrs. F. Eckert.
Treasurer, Mrs. L. L. Lampman.
Secretary, Mrs. B. J. Schoregge.
Directors, Mrs. A. H. Vohs and Mra.
M. S. Phillips.
A vote of thanks was recorded to
the outgoing officers, Mrs. A. H.
Brown, Pres., Mrs. T. Honkins, Sec
retary and Mrs. F. W. MacManus,
Treasurer.
They have been faithful in the trust
committed unto, them and with the
success of the supper on Monday last
leaves the organization free of any
assumed encumberances.
Special Service For
Base Ball Returns
Arrangements have been made to
receive the news of Che Boston
Brooklyn World Series ball games,
which begin Saturday, Oct. 7, by
Western Union service. The bulletins
which will tell the chief features of
the games each half inning will be
posted in the room one door south of
the Williston Drug Co., in the room
recently occupied by H. V. Smith. An
admission of 25 cents per game will
be charged or one dollar for the series.
After the cost of the service is paid
and balance remaining will be placed
to the credit of the Williston base ball
club account as a start toward next
season's needs.
The coming series for the world's
pennant, between the Boston Ameri
cans, known as the "Red Sox," and
the Brooklyn Nationals, called the
"Dodgers" -promises to be one of the
closest and most uncertain ever
staged. Pick your favorite and fol
low the dope.
Electricity Will
Supplant Gasoline
The Graphic has arranged to trans
fer to the light and power depart
ments of the city some of the patron
age it has been giving to the oil mag
nates. In the past the metal for the
linotype typsetting machine has been
melted by gasoline heat, a method
neither satisfactory nor economical.
An electric pot has been purchased
and as soon as it is installed city cur
rent will reduce the pigs of type
metal to the liquid form. The elec
tric pot is an expensive but modern
device which automatically regulates
the heat to even temperature, a thing
difficult to do with gasoline. An ex
tremely sensitive coil spring device
shuts off or turns on the current and
regulates the heat within a fraction
of a degree.
Kassis' Building
Being Enlarged
Kassis Bros, have a force of men
engaged in adding a second story to
their building on East Broadway and
building twenty feet onto the north
end. The extension to the length of
the building will give much needed
additional space to the Odell Fur
nishing store and the Roche grocery
which occupy the old building.
It is understood that Kassis Bros,
will fit up/the second story for Jiving
apartments. The enlarged building
will make a very attractive improve
ment for East Broadway.
Delegates To State
Convention Chosen
Williston delegates to the meeting
of the State Federation of Women's
Clubs to be held at Valley City on
Oct. 10-13, will leave Monday morn
ing to attend the -convention. Those
who will represent the various clubs
are as follows: Mothers club, Mrs.
E. C. Carney B. & T. club, Mrs. W.
H. Westergaard and Mrs. E. R.
Brownson Civic League, Mrs. Geo.
Mcintosh and Mrs. A. E. Lowe.

We've never before had a day like WILLISTON DAY to
remember so lets make this one a day never to be for
gotten. Lets clean up—paint up—shine up—dress up,
especially our store windows-*put on our best front in
fact so everybody'll know they've been somewhere when
we get through. Nothing is too big or too good for WIL
LISTON DAY and if everybody will think up some
thing—and do it—it will sure be SOME DAY. Lets do
it for Williston and lets do it right. The best Armory—
and Company "E"—the best Pontoon Bridge—the best

Fire Prevention Day
Set For October 9
Every year North Dakota and the
whole country as well suffers severe
ly by fires, many of which might be
prevented with proper care. By rea
son of this fire loss the rates of in
surance are high. If we can only
educate the young people in our
schools and the older people upon the
farms, in their homes and in their
business, to clean up their property
and take proper care of it, ana to help
to prevent fires, we can save an enor
mous amount of money each year by
preventing fires.
To the end that the people of the
state may co-operate with the State
Fire Marshal's Department in the re
duction of loss by fire, I hereby des
ignate Monday, October 9th, 1916 as
Fire Prevention Day in the State of
North Dakota. This day is the anni
versary of the Great Chicago fire
where great loss resulted through
carelessness and bad conditions, and
I sincerely urge that the citizens of
the state everywhere co-operate that
Fire Prevention Day may really mean
something in North Dakota.
Done at the Capitol at Bismarck,
this 25th day of September, 1916.
(Seal) L. B. Hanna,
Governor.
By the Governor,
Thomas Hall,
Secretary of State
By John Andrews, Deputy.
September Weather
Was High' Grade
September, although a month that
abounded in pleasant days, was more
than five degrees cooler than the
normal temperature.. The mean aver
age for the month was 54 while the
normal, based on a record of over
thirty years, js 59.5. The lowest tem
perature touched during the month
was 28 on the 22d, and the warmest
was 90 on the 3rd. On the last day
of the month the temperature reach
ed 74. The per cent of sunshine for
the month was 66 and the total pre
cipitation 1.26 inches.
The monthly summary issued by
Observer John Craig, which is the
authority for the above data, shows
that the first killing frost of the sea
son came on the morning of the 14th,
when the mercury descended to 31.
September 14th is the average date
of killing frost as shown by the rec
ords of this station, so the month
was exactly normal in this particular.
First Course Number
Immense Success
The concert given by the Philhar
monic Orchestral Club l$st night, as
the first number of the Community
Lyceum Course proved a delight to
the immense audience at the Armory.

program equalled or excelled any
thing ever rendered in Williston.
The vocal numbers by Martha
Cook were enthusiastically received
and heartily encored.
This first number of the course was
accorded splendid patronage and in
sure the financial success of the
course. In voicing the appreciation
of the committee, during the inter
mission, Rev. Batten said it had been
suggested that a musical attraction
such as Scumann-Heink or Gadski be
secured for Williston and judging
from the audience he believed such a
venture would be warranted. He sug
gested that forty-nine other men join
him in a guarantee agreement.
