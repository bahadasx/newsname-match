"If nV that Wilson has done is to

sired to "view with alarm" with
drawal of Pershing's expedition.
Officials very frankly admitted to
day that while the Atlantic City

to the constant pressing of the Car

American troops, a way was in sight
to continue the negotiations.

Much Mystery Connected With

News-TinvH Speoial St'rvi.-e:
NEW YORK, Oct. f.. Rid ex-
Pres't Roosevelt really shake hands
with ex-Pres't Taft at the Union
league club reception to Candidate
Hughes? This is the question that
all New York is askins because the
mystery which shrouds the meeting
of the two ex-presidents has not yet
been solved. Republican Chairman
Willcox is sure the two men met,
but for the life of him he can't re
member who it was that brought
the two ex-presidents together.
Gov. Whitman claims he is the
one who turned the track, but Col.
Roosevelt's friends laughed at this:
assertion. George R. Sheldon claims
that he was the peacemaker, hut as
yet he has been unable to prove his
case. The whole affair is gradually
being looked upon in this city as a
Huge hoax, perpetrated by the re
publican old guard at the expense
of Mr. Roosevelt. Not a single one
of the hundreds who were present
at the reception has stepped forward
to declare that they witnessed the
much advertised event.
When Chairman Willcox was asked
about the meeting of the two ex
presidents today he smiled a deep,
mysterious smile. To the newspaper
men who called upon him he added
more mystery to the much myster
ious proceeding by unloading the
following:
Can't i:eniemlor Story.
"Now, I'm not sure who told me
but somebody did, just who. 1 can't
remember. The story as I heard it
was that Col. Roosevelt, and Mr.
Taft went down the elevator after
the supper and the speeches at the
reception at the Union League club
last night, and one of them, just
which one, I can't say. because I
don't just remember, put his hand
on the shoulder of the other, just
which one I can't say. I wish I
could because I always like to help
you boys out, and said. 'What you
said In your speech was tine, it just
touched the pcint.' Now. which one
it was who said that I heard, of
course, but I cin't recall, and I can't
recall who told me so. I really can't
be the authority for the story."
Mr. Willcox. who did it? "Who
did what?" 'Who introduced the
Col. and Mr. Taft? You ought to
know-, it was your party."
"Twasn't my party," retored Mr.
Willcox. "I told you that before it
Vas a reception by the Union
league club tc Mr. Hughes and the
two republican ex-presidents were
invited. But ir' anybody wanted evi
dence that the two ex-president s
who were rivals for the presidency
in R12 were united now in behalf
of a republican nominee, why, there
last night was the open and visible
evidence of that unity."

"Did Gov. Whitman introduce

and so I wasn't on the spot to see
the creetin b.-tween Col. Roosevelt
and Mr. Taft, but I don't think s-o."

Hardy, prohibition candidate for

tpeech. Hanly, Dr. Ira J. Landrith,
his running mate, ana Oliver W.

here on the prohibition special train
which today is touring outh Da

"Mr. Roosevelt seems to he labor

he was nominated at Chicago and is
now running auainst Mr. Wilson.'"
said Hanly. "The truth ?s he was
repudiated and scorned at Chicago.
The people are not interested in
what he would have done or what
he would do. They want to know
what Mr. Hughes would do and that
should be proclaimed by that dis
tinguished jurist himself and not
through the lips f another. The
American people want the republi
