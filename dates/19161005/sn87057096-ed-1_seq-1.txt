SPECIAL AT IDLE HOUR.
Edna Wallace Hopper and Frank
Sheridan in "The Perils of Di
vorce" Monday Night. 'r'~
One of the best feature plays .ever
booked for the Idle Hour theatre is in
coming on Monday,' Oct. 9th, when
"The Perils of Divorce," starring
Edna Wallace Hopper and Frank
Sheridan will be presented. This '0
picture has had a great run in all
the leading cities, and it presents .%
one of the leading topics of the day.
Time was when kings dared think
of divorce, but among the folks in
the ordinary walks of life, it was
thought.to be part only of the evil
men do. But now we live in an en
lightened age—or do we? Fashions
are ever changing. That which fas
cinates the eye today, tomorrow—
will be listed as passe or "out of
date." Every nation faces the l.~
vorce Question." That this great and
growing evil is a dangerous proposi
tion, if not regulated, has been con
ceded by the ablest authorities, and
yet divorce is in many cases justi
fied. What society will do in order
to protect the coming generations,
reifiains to be seen. Those who grap- 5
pie with the great problem, will find
food for thought in the "Perils of
Divorce," a cleverly presented story
of the life of John Graham, who mis
judged Constance, his wife, and in
that hour, when all must pay, realiz
ed his great error. Whether you are |j
young or aged, married or single, en
gaged or as Sergeant Kelley remark
ed, "courting Sally," the story—
"Perils of Divorce," will please you,
because it is not only unusual, but it
ends happily. Don't miss it.
