ST. LOUIS. Oct. ."..Five persons
are dead and others missing as a
result of fare which destroyed Chris
tion Brothers College here today. The
dead: Brother Carmack, 92; Brother
Clement. 78; Ixiuis Nolan, 33; Fire'
Lieut Budde ana ladderaan Kueh-
nert
Brothers Carmack and Clement
were burned to death In the infirmary.
Nolan died of injuries received as he
leaped from a window of tho in
firmary where he was a nurse.
A wall collapsed at noon and buried
beneath it a dozen firemen. Some of
them scrambled from beneath the
wreckage. Firemen lludde and Kueh
nert were struck by heavy timbers
and killed. Three men are missing
and are thought to be beneath the
ruins, according to Fire Chief Hen
derson at 3 o'clock.
The monetary loss is given at $300,-
000.
The fire, which started at 7:30
o'clock spread rapidly and In less
than an hour had almost completely
destrojed the institution, one of the
oldest Catholic schools in the United
States.
Brother Carmack, among the oldest
brothers in the order, was on the re
tired list and lived In the infirmary
on the fifth floor. The infirmary was
cut off almost immediately after the
outbreak. The small death list was
due to the rule which compels students
to rise at C o'clock. There are about
300 students in the school. The de
struction of the college probably
means the disbandment of the institu
tion in St. Louis.

C. A. Ellwood, at Commer
cial Club Luncheon, At
tacks Political Misrule.
ASKS CIVIL SERVICE
Speaker Explains Plans for
Conference to Meet Here
in November.
'".Missouri is lagging far behind in
social welfare and social legislation,"
charged Dr. Charles A. Ellwood, pro
fessor or sociology in the University,
who addressed the members of the
Commercial Club , at their weekly
luncheon today In the Virginia Grill.
Doctor Ellwood spoke on the Impor
tance of the State Conference on So
cial Welfare, which will meet In Co
lumbia November 26, 27 and 2S, ex
plaining its scope and telling how
the Commercial Club might help make
the meetings successful to the city as
well as to the state.
"W. F. Kuhn, former superinten
dent of the state hospital at St Jo
seph, told me that there was not a
single hospital for the Insane in Mis
souri worthy of the name," said Doc
tor Ellwood. "Those then in exist
ence, he said, were mere barracks.
This was eight years ago, but I am
certain that the conditions remain
the same.
"And conditions will remain the
same until such institutions ( are
taken out of the hands of the poli
ticians. The present method of ad
ministration Is fundamentally wrong,
and not until we get civil service
laws which will provide for the ap
pointment of experts to take charge
of those institutions will they be
worthy of the name. It Is the hope
of the State Conference on Social
Welfare that through education a way
will be found to bring about these
ehanges.
"The State Conference, on Social
Welfare," said Doctor Ellwood, "tries
to do for the state that which civic
leagues do for a city. The Confer
ence Is not a political body, although
it is a progressive body, fit Is not
made up of a lot of cranks, but of
serious social workers, students and
state officials who are earnestly In
terested In the best ways to better
the state.
"It Is not, however, simply a con
ference of state officials, and should
not be confused with-the State Board
of Charities and Corrections which is
an official body. The conference is
a non-official tody doing Educational
work and wants every good citizen
of the state back of the movement
"We hope to have as one of the
speakers Thomas Mott Osborne, war
den of Sing Sing prison In New York.
Or, if it Is impossible to have Mr.
Osborne with us, Warden Tynan of
Colorado, second only to Mr. Osborne
In prison reforms, will speak before
the conference. Some other speakers
we hope to have are Prof. Graham
Taylor of the Chicago School of
Civics and Philanthropy, who is an
advocate of applied Christianity: Fred
Almy, president of the National Con
ference of Charities and Corrections:
Julia Lathrop of the Federal Chil
dren's Bureau, and Doctor William S.
Snow, national secretary of the Social
Hygiene Association."
Purd B. Wright, public librarian of
Kansas Citv. will speak on "The Li
brary and the Business Man" at the
meeting of the, Commercial Club next
Thursday.

COLIBiS TALKING
OF A CM! CLUB
Local Business Men Com
ment Favorably Upon Idea
of a Rural Organization.
WOULD FILL A NEED
Desirable Sites Near City
Would Have 18-Hole
Course and Courts.
That a country club for Columbia
may be more than a possibility is in
dicated by opinions-of business men of
the city regarding It Many feel that
Columbia needs tuch a gathering
place and that it should be started
now. They refer to other cities of the
same size which have a club under
less favorable conditions than those
existing in Columbia.
Columbia being a University com
munity is particularly adapted for the
formation of a country club, they say.
Instances have been cited of other
university communities of the Middle
West of the same population and
smaller which maintain well conduct
ed clubs with a golf course and other
fields for athletic sports.
Club For Men and Families.
"I think Columbia should have a
country club if It can be conducted
properly," John C. Holloway said yes
terday. "I see no reason why it should
not. A country club would include not
only the men but also their families.
That is one of its best features. There
are some excellent locations for a club
within a short distance of the city and
I believe a movement for the forma
tion of this club would meet with suc
cess. I am in favor of one."
"The right kind of a country club
would be an excellent thing for this
city," Ira T. G. Stone said. "There Is
a place in the social life here that
can only be filled by a club. In ad
dition to this, a country club with a
golf link and a clubhouse would give
the business men an opportunity to
get out into the open. It would give
them an opportunity to get out Into
the country and rest"
That there Is a place in Columbia
for a country club is the opinion of
W. Emmett Smith.
City in a Receptive Mood.
"I have never thought of the possi
bilities of a country club," Mr. Smith
said, "but I am in favor of one. Care
should be taken in its conducUon and
organization, for it is a big undertak
ing. Nevertheless, I think there Is an
excellent field for one and I like the
idea."
"There was never a time when Co
lumbia was in a more receptive mood
for a country club than now," C. B.
Rollins said. "A country club has its
good features and few bad ones. There
are many things to be considered in
the formation of a club but I think
the organization is a possibility worth
considering. It will take work."
Other business men of Columbia
have expressed their approval as have
several members of the University
faculty. The country club when or
ganized would have a clubhouse, a
golf course cither nine or eighteen
holes tennis courts and possibly
grounds for other outdoor sports.
