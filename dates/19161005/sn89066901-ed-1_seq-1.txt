Mailer PEGGY SHORT
MR. HUGHES HAS EXPLODED THE
"KEPT-U8 OUT-OF-WAR"
ARGUMENT.
Mr. Hughes' attack upon tbe "kept-us-out-of-war"
argumeut has aroused
a slur; of enthusiasm.
"Kept us mt of wart he demands.
"Why. there were nineteen men good
Amerleuu soldiers, shot down at Vera
i -rni unit munv Mexicans were killed
by our men. That was war. More-
ovtr. It was a very Ignoble war. l
lia-.e heard three explanations of the
Vera Cruz move.
"First, It was explained that tt was
made In order to compel somebody
to salute the flag somebody who bad
Insulted us. But tbe flag was not sa
luted and has not been to this day.
Thn it wua said that the salute was
pot what we sought, but to prevent
the landing or a boatload oi amiuuui
ti.,n Intimrirtl for Huerta. The aiumu
nltlou, lauded, however, aud It has
beeu shown that It reached Huerta
In due season without Interference on
mir nart.
"When that reason was shown to
ha nntenahla. third one aud possibly
th real one finally was advanced.
It was said that our seizure of Vera
Cruz was a move to compel the retire
ment of Huerta. It seems posaiuie
that this is 'true, although we had
promised the Mexicans that we would
uot Interfere In their affairs and told
them more than once that we wanted
them to handle their own affairs.
"That la why the Mexlcaus could
not understand us aud that U why
they show Utile faith In our promises.''

shot n in almost ewry civilized
ind semi civilized countries dur
ing thri e trips around the world,
was the act commanded to ap
pear a second time before the
late King Edward of England,

their day, and having inherited
the keen sense of sound develop .
