CHIEF KREATZ ORDERS
DRAGNET FOR VIOLATORS
Kangaroo Court in Full Swing}
Judge A. A. Andrews on Bench
Lycan is Attorney.
Headed by George Kreatz, chief oE
police of the Kan
garoo court, five po
lice officers this af
ternoon at 3:30
o'clock raided the
down town section
of Bemidji, arrested
many prominent
merchants on vari
ous charges, hustled
them into the "Black Maria" and
took them to the armory kangaroo
court, officially opening the Elks'
carnival.
The carnival is without a doubt
one of the biggest affairs of its kind
ever staged in Bemidji or this dis
trict. Arrangements were com
pleted early today and when the big
show was opened this afternoon at
3:30 o'clock everything was in readi
ness and in full swing.
Andrews on Bench.
Judge A. A. Andrews occupied the
bench at the kangaroo court and
handed out "stiff" sentences.
"It must be understood," said the
judge, "that the laws in Bemidji must
be obeyed the next three days. I will
not fix any big fines today, but in
the future anyone appearing before
me will get not get off very easily.
I am going to be strict, I. am."
Ralph Lycan acted as prosecuting
or persecuting attorney, the Pioneer
correspondent who visited the Ar
mory this afternoon did not know
which.
The armory for the next three days
will be known as the "Hall of Fun."
Chief Kreatz has thrown out a
dragnet and he will arrest anyone
caught frowning or having
"blues" on this great occasion. Ev
eryone is ordered to smile, or if they
can't smile to grin, to laugh out loud
at everything and to be sure to have
a good time.
Get Bogus Money.
There is a little "red tape" connect
ed with getting into the hall. First,
as you enter the hall, a fellow sticks
his head out of the ticket window and
asks you how much money you want.
Think of it, how much do you want.
You tell him and then in exchange
for Uncle Sam's money he presents
you with some finely printed money.
Bogus money is what he called it but
could not be because Chief Kreatz
watched him hand it out This
money is in denominations of five,
ten and twenty-five cents and they
are worth more because on the in
side everything is sold for the Best
Prices On Earth. No cash will be
accepted at the booths'.
There are all kinds of booths.
Music at the carnival tonight will
be furnished by the Wangdoodle
Pickaninny band and orchestra.
Over 400 lights are used in the
armory and the hall is beautifully
decorated.
At the city hall tonight will be
given a dance Admission will be
ten cents a dance and the "light fan
tastic" will be "tripped like it never
was tripped before" The hall is
prettily decorated The Bemidji or
chestra will furnish the music to
night. Tomorrow night the "color
ed" orchestra will play at the dance
and the Bemidji orchestra will play
at the armory.
There was a good crowd at the
armory this afternoon and indica
tions are that the hall will be crowd
ed tonight.

ACTION FOR DEEPENING

CARNIVAL.
TONIGHT LET'S GO
Red River Development association
and action will be taken to prevent
the flooding of lands around the Red
Lakes and streams running into the
lakes.
To Make Trip.
Senator D. P. O'Neil of Thfef River
Falls, M. C. Cutter of Thief River
Falls, Mr. Dugan a Federal engineer
of St. Paul, and Charles S.* -Carter,
candidate to the state legislature
from this district, will leave Bemidji
Friday morning to make a trip of
investigation to the Red Lakes and
down the Red Lake river to Thief
River Falls.
They will go to the Red Lake In
dian agency from Bemidji and will
go from there to Highlanding where
they will hold a meeting on Saturday
to hear complaints and recommenda
tions. On Sunday they will hold a
meeting at Thief River Falls.
It is asserted that the Red lake is
more than three feet above its normal
height and that at times it is four
or five feet above normal. As a con
sequence water is backed on the farm
lands lying along tributary' rivers
leading to the lake and also flooding
farm lands on the west side of the
lake towards Thief River Falls, 'It-
is estimated that the high- waters are
affecting about 1,000,000 acres of
land.
Favor a Dam.
Some of the residents living along
the Red Lake river, it is said, are in
favor of building a dam at the out
let of Red lake in the Red Lake river
and raising the level of the lake even
higher than it is now. In this way
it is said greater power at power
dams along the river between Red
Lake and Grand Forks may be se
cured.
Residents of Beltrami and Koochi
ching counties want the lake lower
ed several feet and contend that if
the Red Lake river channel from its
outlet to what is known as High
landing is straightened and deepen
ed that a more even flow of water will
be secured and that it will drain
more efficiently the thousands of
acres of ditch lands throughout the
northern part of the state.
Does Much Damage.
It is said that on account of the
water being unable to get out of Red
Lake through the outlet of the Red
Lake river, water in the ditches and
rivers tributary to Red Lake backs
up many miles and floods the farms
of the settlers, doing thousands of
dollars damage annually.
For that reason residents of Be
midji and Beltrami county will en
deavor to have the channel at the
outlet deepened and widened and if
necessary will attempt to have legis
lation passed to authorize the work.
The estimated cost of the work is
$225,000 and, on account of the river
being navigable, it is believed one
third of the cost will be borne by
the government, one-third by the
state and the other third by those
whose property is affected.
NOISY LUNATIC FROM
BLACKDUCK IS KILLED
Fergus Falls, Minn Oct. 5.Al-
bert Cauchon of Blackduck, inmate

til he undertook to indulge in the
hobby at night. Then the man in,
the next bed picked up a dish and
struck the noisemaker on the fore
head. Cauchon's death followed. A
coroner's inquest resulted in the-de
cision that the man died of natural
causes, although possibly death was
hastened by the blow.

Governor Burnquist Institutes Action
on Findings of the Public
Examiner.
TWENTY-THREE CHARGES
OP IRREGULARITIES MADR
Bond Sales and Road Buildin Con
tracts are Questioned in,
Complaint.
Governor J. A. A. Burnquist yes
terday instituted an
investigation of ir
regularities in Cass
county notably with
regard to bond sales
and commissions
paid on them, road
building contracts
and other transac
tions, principally by
the county commissioners. The In
vestigation was instituted on the
findings of State Public Examiner
Andrew E. Fritz in a special examina
tion made at the governor's direction
following complaints by three Cass
county citizens.
Louis S. Headley, who recently re
signed as clerk in the state legal de
partment to engage in law practice in
St. Paul, was appointed commissioner
to take testimony for and against the
county commissioners named in the
allegations.
Officials Keen Jobs.
Governor Burnquist announced that
no suspension of county officials
would be made pending the inquiry,
contrary to the proceedings in prog
ress in Koochiching county charges.
The complaint to the governor is
signed by Thomas Peterson, J. R.
Blackburn and E. S. Holman, as Cass
county taxpayers. C. D. Bacon now
is county auditor, succeeding I. P.
Byhre, whose name is connected with
the irregularities charged. The pres
ent board of county commissioners is
made tip of Fred Moulster, W. B.
Jones, J. E. Krake, J. B. Spencer and
A. J. Swapberg. J~X
Twenty-three" separate charges or
criticisms were contained in the com
plaint, each is referred to in the
report by Examiner Fritz of the in
quiry made by his department.
G. A. Elder Mentioned.
George A. Elder, agent of the Du
luth Securities company, who figured
in the Koochiching county charges,
is mentioned in connection with al
leged excessive commissions and in
terest rates paid on bonds sold by
Cass county.
The complainants cited sales of El
well road bonds between May 1, 1915,
and March 1, 1916, of $474,000 at
5% per cent interest and $1,800 com
mission, and said they had every rea
son to believe that the bonds could
have been sold at a lower rate of in
terest and no commission. The pub
lic examiner reports that there is
no evidence that the board could
have had any idea of the value ,of
Cass county bonds.
The report, however, criticizesy
some of the sales for being made
without advertising as required by
law, and explains that a warning
given at the time by the examiners'
department resulted in the board
rescinding certain action, but finally
selling a $60,000 issue after raising
the interest to 5% per cent and
agreeing to pay an agent 5 per cent
for placing the bonds. The auditor
refused to sign the warrants, and
settlement was made when the agent
agreed to take $1,200 commission.

Other Deals Mentioned.
Other bond transactions are dis
cussed at length as are also those re
lating to road building contracts.
Contract prices are given as $,721.73
on state rural highway No 45 $1,-
568 14 on highway No. 81, and $2,-
607 83 on highway No. 83.
The examiner fails to find that the
commissioners exceeded their auth
ority, as complained, by floating
$544,000 of road and funding bonds
during the ten-month period named.
The report states that although
the law limits the appropriation to
$500 for a county exhibit at the state
fair, the manager's report shows ex
penditures of $804.54, but $291.25 of
the amount received from premiums,
pictures and so forth, and the law
does not state that such proceeds
shall be turned into the county rev
enue and the balance of $13.29 was
not paid by the county. Payments of
$50 and $20 to Commissioners Moul
ster and Jones, respectively, and the
salary of $150 paid Mr. Brewster also
is unlawful.
Examiner Fritz declines to place
values on the services of attorneys
paid $625 on highway No. 80, $395
on No. 81 and $360 on No. 83, while
no attorneys were engaged on the
two other road projects.
Rated "Unbusinesslike."
Alleged evasion of the law in con
nection with the contract letting on
the Remer-Bear river road, is com
plained of and the transaction is
rated "unbusinesslike."
An effort to bring about a confer
ence between the complainants and.
the accused, Examiner Fritz said,
was abandoned when the committee
for the complainants objected to the.
plan.
