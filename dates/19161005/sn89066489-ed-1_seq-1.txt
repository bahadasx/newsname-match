NUMBER 51
JEFFERSON HIGHWAY
ROUTE SELECTED
Bates County Committee Met
Tuesday Afternoon and
Mapped Out Route
Through County. -
The Bates County Jefferson
Highway committee composed of
C. A. Allen "and Frank Beam, of
this city, and Sam Avails and
John Speer, of Adrian and H. P.
Robinson, of Rich Hill, met in this
city Tuesday afternoon and
mapped out a route through the
county for the proposed highway.
The route as selected . by the
committee begins at the Vernon
county line between sections 20
and 21 and runs north following
the main traveled road to Rich
Hill, where it enters the town on
Sixth street. Turns west at Park
avenue to the cemetery, then
north on what is known as the
West Road to Butler. North on
High street "to Ohio street then
east to the northeast corner of the
square, then north three miles,
west one mile and then six miles
north to Adrian, which it enters
at the southeast part of town and
proceeds west on -Main street
through the town, then north past
the Crescent Hill cemetery, west
across the bottoms and then north
to the county line.
The committee then made ar
rangements for marking the tele
phone poles along the route as
selected tnrowgn tne county, ine
official marking for the Jeffer
son Highway is a blue band six
inches wide around the pole, eight
feet from the ground and sur
mounted -by a white band twelve
inches wide and then another blue
band six inches wide. On the
white band is a black monogram
of the two letters, J; H.
The selection of a route through
the county was a vexatious prob
lem for the committee.... ,Tliere
were several proposed routes and
each route had its friends, but on
ly one route could be selected, and
the committee went over each of
them and carefully considered the
claims of each and then designat
ed the one that in their judgment
would make the best 365 day in
the year road. Now that the route
has been selected through the
county it is time for all good road
boosters to take off their coats
and put the road in such good
condition that the Jefferson High
way directors will make it a part
of that route. .
Bates County- Girl Makes a Suc
cess in the Life Insurance
Business.
Among the agents of the New
York Life Insurance Company,
there is a club called the "$100,
000 Club." The chief require
ment for admission is that the
agent must write $100,000 worth
of paid up insurance in' the year.
Recently the club held a meeting
at the Hotel Traymore, at Atlan
tic City, New Jersey, all of the ex
penses of the members being paid
by the company. The following
clipping from the New York Bul
letin, the official organ of the
company, refers to Mrs. Lucille
Goerner, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. W. P. Sevier, of Summit :
"Mrs. Lucille Qoer-ner, of St.
Joe, Missouri, responded for the
ladies in a dignified, womanly
fashion that captivated her audi
ence. She is highly thought of
by her branch. The hoys all call
her the "Little Queen." Her es
corts were proud of their charge.
She reflects credit on the buisness
woman."
Mrs. Goerner is fast becoming
one of the most valuable agents
of the company in this part of
the country. She' wrote her $100,
000 worth of paid up insurance
between January 1st and August
1st, this year.
Butler High School Notes.
To the patrons of the Butler
High School, to the rural students
and to all who are fnterested in
the upbuilding of the community,
I wish to call attention.
There is an enrollment of two hun
dred and forty students in this
school now. It is said that the
school has the largest enrollment
of rural students in the state.
This is something to be proud of.
How many parents whose children
finished the eighth grade last
year have helped to gain this dis
tinction for our school ?
Every student seems to be very
much interested in the success of
the school. The student govern
ment is moving along in a very
pleasing way. The Freshmen
bothered the government officials
at the beginning of the year but
are quieted down to work now,
An orchestra of about twelve
pieces has been organized. It
promises to be the best for sev
eral years.
A debating club has been
formed with about fourteen char
ter members. Opportunities are
offered to students in this club
that are not offered in any other
department in the school. Mr.
Gibson, one of the new teachers,
has charge of the club. The club
promises to do very effective
work.
On the twenty-first of Septem
ber the student body elected the
following officers for the ensuing
year : Emmett Bullock, president ;
Clyde Borland, vice president;
Walter Williams, Secretary;
Gladys Weir, treasurer; Carroll
Zwahlen, reporter ; Claude Mc
Combs and Logan Price, yell
leaders.

their school year. We are be
ginning with all of our old enthus

roll Zwallen, vice president ; Wal
ter Williams, secretary; Veva El

reporter; Virgil Lockard ser-geant-at-arms,
and senators, Nor
ma Keirsey and J.ewell Thompson.
We are getting ready for some
good basket ball games. Doris
Denton was elected captain of the
girl's team.
It seems "that all of the teachers
know that the Juniors are excep
tionally intelligent pupils be
cause they have been assigning
exceptionally long lessons.
Wp expect to accomplish great
things during the year to keep up
our reputation of being 'the class
that does things.' If you don't
believe us just watch us.
Sophomore Notes.
Our summer holidays are over
and we have now settled ourselves
to nine months of study. Several
of the Sophomore girls enjoyed
themselves very much at the party
given by the Loyal Daughters of
the Christian church Thursday
evening at the home of Miss Zola
Jackson.
When a' wienie roast was sug
gested as a means of smoothing
from our brows the lines of care
left there by four weeks of hard
study, the class cheerfully agreed.
Accordingly, on Friday afternoon,
the class assembled at the High
School building, from whence we
departed, on a hay wagon for
Vthite's" Grove and the weinie.
roast.' Arriving there, we built a
fire and roasted wienies to our

our way homeward. XXX
