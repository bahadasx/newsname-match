W. F. Caldwell Who Spent Seven |
Weeks In Camp With Guardsmen
on Border Describes Rapid
Rounding Into Practical
Efficiency?Men Worrk
Admirably.
The training which the South Carolina
National Guardsmen are receiving
on the Mexican border Is fitting
them for duties which are performed
by tbe regular army, and the results
which the Palmetto men are showing
guarantee that it will be hard to tell
them from regulars when their period
of training is ended.
Those young men of South Carolina
who went to the Mexican border
in response to the call of President
Wilson were inspired by the same
patriotic and high minded purpose
that has characterized this State on
all the occasions of the past when
the call to duty went forth. They
are descendants of the men who helped
to put down tyranny in 1770,
fought the second war of Independence
against England in 1S12, subdued
tbe red men and the lawless
regimes of the earlier days of the republic,
conquered Mexico and poured
out their life blood on the many battlefields
of the glorious army of the
"Lost Cause." South Carolina was
the I: st to respond then and she was
among the first to mobolize when the
president of th; f.rJftd State* summoned
the National Guard to arms in
the closing days of June to guard the
border between tnis country ana
^Sou^^'ca^na
was the first of the Southern States to
> send her National Guard to |he border,
and they were ready to go several
weeks before orders came for
them to move. In fact the Palmetto
troops were ready as tarly as those of
New York and the other Northern
States who were rushed to Texas just
as fast as they could be gotten ready.
As it was the Palmetto troops have
been on the border for two months
and it is only in the last few days
that the guardsmen from the other
Southern States have begun entraining
for Texas.
This is not said with any disparagement
of the other States of the South
but it is the record and it is nothing
but due "those men who have left
their homes and their business in all
parts of the State to call this item of
credit to the attention of the public.
During the seven weeks I was in
camp at El Paso, Texas, with the
South Carolina soldiers, I had daily
reason to bee proud of my State and
my State's soldier boys. Time and:
again I heard it stated that they camel
to the border better equipped, better
prepared and more efficient In every
way than most of the National Guard
regiments. This was due to several
things. They are well officered and
their personnel Is high and they have
that patriotic devotion to duty that
they have inherited from their fathers.
And then, too. South Carolina
has been fortunate In having as the
inspector instructor of her National
Guard Capt. J. Malcom Graham. He
knows his business and he was all
business at Camp Styx while the boys
were being equipped and made ready
for the border. He kept things moving
aud backed up as he was by the
officers of the various organizations
the South Carolina commands were
made ready and sent on their way in
better shape than was the condition
of the average National Guard organization
of other States, judging from
what I saw and from what I heard
while in camp on the border. All of
the regular army officers speak in
complimentary terms of Capt. Graham
and there is no l>etter officer or
more genial gentleman.
On Seventy Mile Hike.
The South Carolina boys have
been undergoing a strenuous programme
of field training, first by ' companies.
then by batalions. wxt by
regiments, that followed by brigade
and now they have l>een formed into
a division with four additional brigades
from other States and will be
put through several days of field manoeuvres.
The division will be under
the command of C,en. Morton. The
press dispatches of this week from El
Paso mentioned the fact that the Palmetto
soldiers with the rest of their
division would he taekn for a hike to
Las Onices. M.. which is some 70
miles from their camp. They will go
fully equipped, just as if they were
taking the field during actual war and
will undergo all the training which a ;
ina Soldiers
Is at Front
big army exj>eriences in the field during
war times.
Of all the National Guard organizations
which were encamped in the
El Paso patrol district, it is sad
that Massachusetts ranked first in efficiency,
Michigan second and South
Carolina third. Both Massachusetts
and Michigan had been on the Iwrdei
six weeks before the Palmetto boyf
arrived and it must also be remembered
that those States appropriate
many times the amount of money foi
their National Guard that South Caro
lina does. Their States are more
prosperous, and have more money tc
give them, for one thing. I believe
that, given the same length of training
on the border, the Palmetto boy?
will rank No. 1 in efficiency among all
the National Guard organizations ol
all the States.
It means something to be from
South Carolina. When you told any
one that you were from the Palmettc
States they were as cordial and friend
ly as you could wish. It's an oi>eii
sesame to have "N. G. S. C." on your
uniform and it just naturally made
me feel good all over to observe this
fact.
The soldier boys are all working
hard and doing whatever is given
them without murmuring. Of course,
they think a lot of home and would
| like to be back with their peopl.e bul
they are not kicking and "cussing*
like some I heard. They do feel as
if they ought not to be kept sitting
down on the Texas plains in a concentration
camp indefinitely. They re
sponded to the call 'to arms when it
looked as if there was going to b
trouble with Mexico, and they today
would go over the Rio Grande with a
shout if orders came from Washington
to inrade Mexico. They have been
in camp cow iince June 18, either at
Styx or in their present location
s?ven miles out of ?1 Paso on the
fftTf -fllffjB" r-1hjf ill fiftlfllfl
tIiwkIo Boys' are ready foi a fight
tat there la little prospect of any
trouble with Mexico at present,
Home Within 30 Days.
Since coming back to Columbia I
Bave been asked time and again when
t thoneht the boy* would come back
home and I have said in about 30
days. Of course I have no direct information
but I believe that either by
November 1 or shortly thereafter all
of the South Carolina soldiers will Ix
returned to Styx and mustered out of
the ft'.'eral service. It seems to be
the plan to return the troops home
in the order in which they went to
the Inirder and thi* means that from
the El Paso district the Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts and Michigan National
Guard will be sent back before South
Carolina, fur they went there before
them. Tliere are some 14,000 Pennsylvanlans.
and probably 3,000 troop*
from Micbegan and Massachusetts. It
takes time to move soldiers and the
equipment which is cafr.\faig the Georgia.
North Carolina and .other troops
to the border will be used for returning
those regiments now on duty
there home. Another reason why I
think the boys will be home in 30 days
is that the field manoeuvres will be
over by October 15 and unless they
are sent on patrol duty along the
border 1hey will have nothing to do.
1 know. loo. from talk* f bad with
some of the higher army officials, that
thev are expecting the National Ouard
to l>e sent back home and mustered
out of the federal service in Xoveral>er.
I think there Ss good reason to
hojK? that the l>oys can he gotten back
in time for the fair and efforts are
being made to this end now by the
Chamber of Commerce of Columbia.
It wiil not do to count too much on
any particular week or day. but I am
reasonably certain that they will be
back either on or immediately after
November 1.
The people of the West ar naturally
most cordial to the South Carolina
soldiers and have made their stay n
the border all the pleasanter by reason
of the attention which they have
shown the men from time to time.
The people of the West are naturally
a hospitable people and in spite of
the many thousands of soldiers who
are encamped in and around El "Paso
many of the leading citizens of the
city have taken time to make the
Palmetto men feel that they are ap
prerintive of their presenee nnd realize
fully that they are there to protect
and defend them and the other
Americans who live on the boundary
between the two countries. Particularly
has this been true of the First
National bank nnd the Chamber of
Commerce, and many other business
places. They make you feel at home
in El Paso and refuse to let you feel
that you are in a stramre lnnd.

A Course Plainly Indicated.
In a letter published in The Advei
tiser of Laurens, Mr. W. R. Riehej
nominated in the recent primaries fo
member of the house and who ha
been classed as a member of th
Blease faction, defends his position 1
: the State executive committee in relc
tion to the chargs of frauds in th
primary. Mr. Richey's letter cor
eludes with thiB significant expre*
, sion: "I will say further that the onl
I way you can keep me from doing m
duty when it comes to exposing ele<
( tion frauds, is to eliminate eleetlo
. frauds and if it takes the Australia
. system of balloting to prevent frau<
, then let's introduce that system."
As a member of the General Assen
( bly the opportunity is l>efore M
^ Riehey to press for the reform the
evidently is already in his mind. Th
i principal newspaper aligned with th
, Blease faction is an advocate of th
k Australian system. A proposal fc
its adoption would hardly be oppose
, by Gov. Manning who, we believe, ir
I troduced in the House of Represnti
tives an "Australian ballot" bill mor
than twenty years ago.
A quarter of a century ago fraud
. in elections were expected as t
, course in New York and other grec
, cities. They are seldom heard c
, now. The explanation is that th
, Australian plan of voting has mad
, them almost impossible.

mary system in South Carolina, tal

Then the people, after sickening c

Ifwew?re to adopt the Australia

BANDITRY BOOMS IN POOR
MEXICO
Starvation and Lawless Hordes Menacing
Even Vera Crux
Washington, Oct 2.?Banditry and
starvation are on the Increase in Mexico,
according to official reports today
to both the state and the navy
departments.
The bandits have become a menace
to the city of Vera Crux which Is now
threatened with attack.
Capt Guy H. Burrage, of U. S.
S. Nebraska, at Vera Cruz, sent in a
report that bandits have blown up a
train on the Vera Cruz-Mexico City
railroad. Bandits have been gathering
in the Vera Cruz section for a long
time and It now appears that they are
beyond the control of the Carranza
troops at Vera Cruz and Mexico City.
War department reports show similar
widespread opposition to the
Carranza government In the northern
tier (I counties.
Army officers today said these facts
furnished one of the best reasons why
tha fo**rnmumt should not rieM IjO th*[
tflTjrfJbr of the Mexican delegates on
the Mexican commission that President
Wilson ordered the withdrawal of
Pershing's army.
Gen. Edward H. Plummer In command
of the Second Idaho infantry,
was accideutly shot yesterday afternoon
by a sentry on the Mexican side
of the line, who however, was saidi!
to have been firing at an escaping ji
prisoner. Gen. Plummer reported:
Man who fired the shot was taken i
into custody by Mexican authorities.
Wound is not dangerous. Accident i
occurred in immediate vicinity of rail- <
road station and was observed by of- <

Columbia, Sept 30.- Former Gover- der
ior Blease today, In the first public fiIo]
itatement which he bus made since ev

he call Issued by Col. W. A. James, era
>f Lee county, for a convention of the er
eform faction of the Democratic party ma
)f South Carolina, to be held in the
lty of Columbia. wU
Col. James, after consulting with n(K
ifr. Blease and other leaders In Colum>ia
today, changed tbi date of the sto
:onventlon to Tuesday cf fair week, ^er
October 24th.
The convention will lie held In the s'n
lounty court hou.se here, which Is con- ton
renlently located for sucn purpose.
Every Democratic club In the state rlc'
s urged to send at least "one true and kal
:rled reformer," and all members of S0E
he faction are cordially invited to at- g("
end. flIc
"I fully agfee," said Mr. Blease, lnt
'that the reform party should have a 1
neetlng during fair week, and I think sal
ruesday night, the 24th, is the best kai
possible date, which could be selected, An
Ifn
md I trust that aB many of our friends
is can do so will attend, and I have
3n doubt that every county In the 11
jtate will be fully represented."
Since the call was issued by Col.
lames, the convention has been the ei
subject of a geat deal of comment, 1)61
ind much speculation has been inlulged
in. Several of the rabid anti- a''
the
Blease newspapers have gone into hysterics
over what tbev see as the pros.
[)ect of a bolt. Neither In the call, co*
aor in any statement which has been
SOI
made by any one authorized to speak,
however, has there been any intlma- i
tlon of anything of the kind. The a
rn<
convention when it meets will decide
||{|I
upon its own course. It is called as
roc
the convention of a faction of the Dem- ,
Dcratic party?and the faction which
Its mem hers sincerely believe Is the *
majority faction in South Carolina ^
this time, and was the majority faq

dorslng the call for the convention,
Mr. Blease was asked this afternoon
7Q
If he yet had any statement to make
In reference to the recent primary. ,'
3D
"I am giving very careful and serious
consideration to the evidence fur
nished me In reference to the fraucj
In the recent primary," he replied. "I
am satisfied that there was a very ^
free use of money and whiskey and
also the Intimidation and coercion of
voteifr. I am still further satisfied
that I received a majority of the votes ^
cast in the second primary for gov- *
ernor. However, I have nothing furth- ^
er than this to say for publication at
this time." gj
It will be recalled that this evidence
was offered the state executive committee
at its meeting. beld here to
tabulate the returns, but was ignored
by the committee, whose chairman
ruled out every reference to it except
the reasons filed by the six members (
)f the committee who voted against .
J0J]
the resolution to declare Governor ^
Manning the nominee of the party. |
There Is an anomalous political sit-j^
nation In South Caollna at this time. I'
! (ifli
it is not recalled that ever before in *
the history of the primary in this|
Jtate has a state executive committee j ^
.'ailed to name a nominee unanimous- j
ly. At a recent meeting, however, |0,111
the vote was strictly factional, the
six members who voted against thej^
esolution expressing their firm con- ^
rtction that the primary was so taint- ?
si with corruption as to endanger the ^
lolldlty of the white man's party in j ^
5outh Carolina. There has so far, !^.
however, l*>en ho authorized state*1
era
nent which would give any foundation
'or the hysterical condition into which
i portion of the press of the state ^
ias l>een thrown. As a matter of
'act, the Blease leaders here today, and
hose who have been here at various .
tec
imes since the second primary, take j
he view that they are really the majority
faction of the Democratic party pn
sought to l?e relegated into a minority
[wsition at the present moment by
eason of the fact that the party ma. j
.'hinery is in the hands of what is jn
rommonly known as the antl-Blease g<j
'action.
Neither Col. James, Gov. Blease '
ior any one else authorized to speak w.(
ias stated any purpose in the call for (
he convention further than was stat?
in the call itself, which was couched r
n plain, unvarnished English, simple cju
?nough to be understood by any school .,
It will be a convention of represent*
itive white men of South Caolina, ""vho
will peacefully assemble under In
:heir constitutional rights and prlvil- to
?ges, to discuss such measures or i>olI- fal
des as they may see fit, or to decide for

That is all there is to it. " Mc
