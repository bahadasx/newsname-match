Railroad News. .
On Wednesday evening of last
week, a story was given to the
Chambereburg Valley Spirit to
the effect that Chambersburg
capital was to build a railroad
from McConnellsburg to a point
in the Broadtop coal fields, the
road to connect with the one now
in course of construction between
McConnellsburg and Fort Lou
don. The route will be by way
of Hustontown, New Grenada
and Wells Tannery. M. C. Sto
ner, of Chambersburg, has leas
ed 600 acres of coal lands said to
contain over 4,000,000 tons of
coal lying in two veins known as
the "Barnett" and "Fulton"
seams, and it is to get at this
coal that the road is to be built.
It is said that the two new roads
will be placed under one manage
ment as soon as completed, and
that the total length will be
about 28 miles. The Chambers
burg company interested is to be
known as the Louise Coal Com
pany. According to statement
mentioned, work on the coal road
will begin about middle of Octo
ber.
Get Questions Ready.
As announced last week, three
farmers' institutes will be held
in the County in December. One
of the features desired by the
speakers is the question box.
These men come to our county
each year to learn conditions, as
well as to instruct Indeed, the
value of the instruction depends
largely on questions asked, as
otherwise, the speakers have to
guess at what will most interest
us. Begin now to make a list of
questions.

ble of continuing the journey
alone, she returned to her home.
On the following Sunday morn
ing it was learned that Mr. Har
ris had not been seen since he
left the top of the mountain on
Thursday. A searching party was
formed, and his lifeless body
found in the woods near one of
Jacob Everts's fields (formerly
the David Myers farm). The
condition of his body indicated
that he had not been dead more
than a day. The probabilities
are, that he wandered from the
road into the forest, became ill
and perished.

Yearick, of McConnellsburg took
place on Tuesday, and his re
mains were laid to rest in the
cemetery at the Hebron church

LIVING ON YOUR NERVES.
Little Talks on Health and fygicne by
Samuel C. Dixon, N. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Do you live on your nerves?
Possibly you do, and boast of it
as if it was something to be
proud of.
Despite ideas to the contrary,
few people ever work themselves
to death. It is usually the com
bination of business and pleasure
at a strenuous pace which does
the damage.
It is so easy to go a little fur
ther on your nerves when you
know that physically you need
restand relaxation. There may
be times of stress and strain
when it is justifiable to exert ev
ery atom of endurance, but this
is only under special circumstan
ces. To practice it regularly in
order to over crowd one's days,
is certain to result disastrously.
There is much in our modern
life with its diversity of interests
which tends to excite and irrita
te the nervous system. We should
make an effort to offset this as
much as possible. One may find
pleasure and diversion without
rushing madly about under high
pressure.
People who live on their nerves
until nervousness becomes chron
ic, find that it brings a train of
evils, indigestion, worry, excita
bility, temper, and restlessness
all great handicaps to efficient
work and rational pleasure.
Made Friends in L'nion County.
From the LewlsburK Journal) )
George A. Harris, Fulton coun
ty's favorite son, candidate for
Congress against Benj K. Focht,
was a visitor in Lewisburg and
Union county this week. Mr.
Harris spent the fore part of the
week touring the various sections
of the county and meeting the
voters. He was piloted by Chair
man S. B." Miller, of New Berlin,
the new county chairman for the
Democratic party.
Thus far Mr. Harris has been
in several of the counties of the
"shoestring" district and has
made'friends wherever he goes.
He is a candidate of the people
and for the people, true, honest,
sincere, big-hearted and fully
capable of representing the peo
ple of thi3 great congressional
district in the halls of Congress.
Wednesday evening an infor
mal meeting was held at the
Cameron house and a large num
ber cf Democrats, and Progres
sives, met the candidate. All
were pleased with him and were
free to express themselves and
willing to vote for him at the
coming election.
In every section of the county
Mr; Harris found friends, many
of them, both in the Democratic
party and among the Progres
sives and even in the Republican
party. They were all impressed
with his straight forward manner
and his sincerity.
Thursday morning Mr. Harris
met a number of the business
men and citizens of the town to
which he presented his candidacy
He was compelled to leave; for
his home in Fulton county at
noon Thursday, but will be back
this way again before the cam
paign closes and will make an ef
fort to meet and greet as many
of Union county's citizens as he
can.
ClineKope.
On September 27, 1916,' Mr.
Donald Cline and Miss Irene
Kope were married in Fannetts
ourg, by the Rev. Kauffman pas
tor of the Presbyterian church
)f that place. The groom is a
son of Mr. and Mrs. S. W. Cline,
of Burnt Cabins. After a trip of
everal weeks, Mr. and Mrs.
Cline will make their home at
Braddock, Pa., where Mr. Cline
has a good position with the steel
Works.
Dr. F. K. Stevens will be at
Hustontown, October 9-10,- at
Dr. A. K. Davis' office, and at
Burnt Cabins on the 11th.
He Got the Hay.
Last Monday, Mr. D. A. Black
of Taylor township, made his
semi-annual trip to McConnells
burg. He always comes 'loaded'
for the agricultural editor of the
News, and he has yet to miss
the mark when he "fires." This
time he hits us on the recent
question about sowing timothy
and clover in the fall without a
nurse crop. He said he thought
we were old enough to know tim
othy and clover would grow and
pay good profits when sown that
way.
To prove his argument, heEaid
that the grass was nearly all kill
ed in one of his wheat fields dur
ing the summer of 1915. After
the wheat had been removed, ho
spring-harrowed the stubble, let
it lie until September, and after
having given it the second har
rowing, he went in with the drill
and sowed timothy, mixed with
alsike and red clover. This sum
mer he cut as fine mixed hay as
any man could wish for four
teen 14-foot loads from twelve
acres, with a lot of hay left on
the ground for good luck.
Now that there is no more
doubt about the effectiveness of
this method, will Mr. Black, or
some other live wire, please tell
us why the steep hills of Licking
Creek township are not seeded
to grass during winter months
when the ground is cracked open
to receive the seed, instead of
first breaking the surface to let
rains wash away the little re
maining soil? Mr. Black's ex
perience may be necessary fre
qently, but our second question
is of importance to all hilly farms
every year. Please answer soon,
as frosts are already at work.
And the Gods Smiled.
The Chambersburg Public
Opinion of Monday morning be
gins an editorial with the follow
ing paragraph :
"There are of the gods those
who spend their time in laughing
when odd things are enacted on
this mundane sphere and these
gods on Saturday evening must
have smiled or perhaps indulged
in a merry ha-ha, when they
witnessed an occurence in Cham
bersburg." The occasion was the entrance
of that unspeakably filthy set of
gypsies that passed through Mc
Connellsburg last Saturday, and
the subject of mirth for the gods
was the inconsistency the re-
diculous practice of the State au
thorities in permitting these fil
thy creatures to. wander all
through districts infected by in
fantile paralysis and then come
into our towns and unload their
half-score of dirty little brats to
mingle with our children who are
supposed to have been kept clean,
not even allowed to meet in Sun
day school, day school, or to at
tend any of the summer social
events so dear to the hearts of
children.
Spare the Pheasants.
Leading sportsmen of this sec
tion have requested the News to
enter a plea for the preservation
of a few Ring-neck pheasants
liberated on Tuacarora mountain
last spring. It is known that
there are some young pheasants
this fall. It is also known that
when let alone for a few seasons,
Ring-necks multiply and become
acclimated, so that we may ex
pect by another year to have
some fair shooting. This hs
been true in New York state
where the climate is colder than
in this state. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that no Ring-necks
will be killed this fall in Todd
township. They were introduced
in Dublin township a few years
ago, and that fall all the tame
birds were killed by pot-hunters.
On Monday evening, October
9th, Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester B.
Woollet of McConnellsburg, will
celebrate the golden anniversary"
of their wedding. About one
hundred and twenty-five invita
tions have been issued.
