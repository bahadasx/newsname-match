lAVAL STATION OTES Pl
i'irvt BIHt To I~k Built.
Arrangements are being made at
the Station for the construction of bar
a sixty foot motor boat for the quar- moi
antine authorities. It is estimated i)o
that this boat will cost about twenty- the
five thousand dollars and will take yes
six montlts to complete. off
The I'. S. S. Machias was undocked whi
Monday and will tie up at the Sta- he
tion wharf to complete her repairs. wat
Admiral Harris, Chief of the Bu- ed
reau of Yards and Docks, visited the his
Station Monday for the purpose of me
inspecting relative to the improve- ('Ia
ntents contemplated in the segrega- sea
tion of the different machine shops. J
etc. The Admiral was much pleased liat
with the conditions as found and ed
will probably recommend the major tail
part of the improvements. par
The Army Dredge Sabine. usually wh
on duty at Sabine Pass, has arrived
at the Station for docking and minor
repairs. This vessel will not be at ne
the Station for very long as the re
pairs to be undertaken can be fin- of
ished in a short time.

TO BUILD U. S. BOAT AT NAVAL Jat
STATION H R
A vessel to cost approximately $25.- Sta
400 will be constructed for the use of on
the public health service. and the Boi
work will be done at the New Orleans Br(
naval station. The vessel will be Fit
used for boarding purposes. Pa
While the boat is small, its con- Jot
struction at New Orleans is regarded I
as important, since it will be the first ert
vessel to be constructed at that yard. Sol
It is believed by many nasal construc- IIe
tors that New Orleans is the logical Ilu
point for building small naval and oth- E.
er vessels needed by the government. Wi
It is regarded as probable that consid
erable work of this class will be done NE
in New Orleans in the near future.
