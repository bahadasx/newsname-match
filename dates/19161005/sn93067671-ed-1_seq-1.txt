Mr.WA H. Aihaere -
OlurlItle city was. saddened S u14I
night when it epnenown tti
W. *. A - hmore *dir dead.44
cloc)C last 'Sunday eveningo aft
onlya f w days illnes, the'spirlt ofth
good wian passed away.
Simnple, but impressive, funeral se
vices were held at the Methodist chur<
onday afternoon, after which all thi
was mettal of this grand old mother I
Israel was tenderly conveyed to or
Silent City, where she now rests
peace. Rev. L. E. Wiggins conducte
the serwilces.
-Mrs. Ashmore was born in Anderso
county 72 years ago and was a daughte
of Elias Elrod. In 1869 she was marrie
to W. H Ashmore dnd he, with si:
children survive. The children are
Mrs. D. J. Carter, of Chicago; S. J
Ashmore, of Witchita Falls, Texas; J
R. Ashmore, of Grand Island, Florida
Miss Maude Ashmore, of Atlanta; Mrs
V. L. Leohr, of Manchester. Ga., 'an
Miss Vesta Ashmore, of Pickens.
Practically all of her married life sh
has lived in Pickens and was one o
Pickens' oldest residents. She was in
trestiing in conversation and recalle4
as if only yesterday the days of loni
ago. Many times the writer has beei
i this hospitable home and listened t<
her recall the days of old, 'listened t4
her motherly advice, and be cheered b3
her bright, sunny, cheerful disposition
and we are saddened to think that thu
good-woman has been called away.
- Her's is a path marked with deeds o:
kindness and cheef. Flowers, no
thorns, sunshine, not shadow, did she
scatter everywhere.
Mrs. Ashmore was an everyday Chris
tian. Her life was a blessing and bene.
faction to all within the sphere of it
influence. She was loved by our people.
It was here that the best days of het
life were spent and it was her desire
that when her last hour had come and
the God of eternity called her to her
%everlasting rest, that beneath the shady
trees of our Silent City on its sloping
hillsides, surrounded by all the beauties
of nature and by a happy and contented
people, should be the eternal aoiding
place of all that was mortal of her.
Well may her children cherish hei
memory as. precious legacy and we
fain would say a word of comfort to the
stricken ones; we can but let our teari
flow gt in sympathy with theirs anc
point them to the promise, "At even
tide 4t shall be light."

Grand Jury Presentment
ky T10 His Honor, Ernest Moore, Presiding
t - Judge:
We, the grand Jury, beg leave to
3r, nhake this final presentment for this
is term of court:
irst-We- have passed on all bills'.
r- handed us. by the solicitor and have
h rendered such veVdicts As the evidence
Lt in our opinion justified.
n Second-Camplaint having been made
ir, to us of failure of land-owners on vari
n ous stieums in Pickens county, and es
d pecially on Saluda and Oolenoy rivers,
to .leep obstructions out of streams,
a thereby ca6sing them to fill up with
r sand and mud and to ruin hundreds of
ij acres of land above them. We there
, fore ask the supervisor and commission- A
erb, by authority~of law vested in tihem,
to.have these obstructions removed at
once. (See 1912 S. C. Code,. Vol. 1,
Sees. 2239, 3240 und 2248.)
Third-We ask that the water in the
i court house tank be used for sanitary
purposes only.
Fourth-Since Pickens county has had
r rural . police disorderly conduct ,along
. public. highways is almqst a thing of
I the past; therefore we ask 'that their
services be continued. Their report, t
herewith attached, shows that from the
5th of June to the 25th of. September
they have sent to the chaingang 1,092 y
days and collected in fines and forfeits
Fifth-There are too many accidents
ion the public highwayi caused by reek
less and fast driving and unlighted
autos, so we ask that all the county of
ficers see that the people hereafter have
some consideration for state. laws in
. regard to speeding and driving unlight
ed ears at night.
Sixth-The county offices have been
examined by a committee and they find A
everything in good condition. The pre
vious grand jury has recommended that
the supposed shortage against our for
mer treasurer, Mr. H. W. Farr, be
cleared, as the past records show there t
is no shortage existing. We, the pres
ent grand jury, re-recommend that the
next legislature pass an act eliminating
this supposed shortage.
Seventh-The committee on roads and
bridges has made a careful inspection
of same and find them generally in bad
condition and recommend that these
i conditions be looked after as early as
possible. See report of said committee
herewith attached.
I Eighth-The committee looking after
poor house and farm find things in yery
good condition. See report of commit
tee on same.
Having discharged our duties as best
we see, we beg to be excused from fur
ther attendance at this term of court.
We wish to thank His Honor, Judge
Ernest Moore, and all court officials for
their kindness and courtesies.
Respectfully submitted:
G. R. HENDRICKS,
Foreman Grand Jury.

"A Dangerous, Precedenit
The following article, written 45 the
editor of the Easley Progress, appeared Be
in'that paper last week in answqri to a 19
recent article written by Joel H.'iller B.
and published in The Pickens Sentinel tel
two weeks ago: M.
"The above communication from r.' se<
Joel H. Miller appeared in The Pickens A.
Sentinel last week. The Progress would dto
take no notice of it had he not referred W,
to what he says he saw take place at L.
Easley on the 12th of thismonth, which me
was the day of the second primary. Mr. Sa
Miller evidently has not read his bible an
profitably else he would have noticed j
that there was always a way provided St(
for one to escape from the conseqqences Re
of what seemed to be inexorable laws. Coi
Note what it says about the man slayer I
bind the way provided for one who acci- car
dentally killed his fellow man. In fact fac
the very plan of salvation itself is found- the
ed on the principle that in order to es- pre
tablish the consequences of sin we must car
appeal to the Great Judge through faith, A.
and He has our name written in. the offi
Book of Life, regardless of all forms of
law.
"Doubtless the seventeen men who
voted at Easley were. good and true
citizens of Pickens county, as much so
as Mr. Miller or the writer. For some neF
reason, probably sickness or absence tl
from their homes at the time required Sel
for enrollment, they failed to get their fer
names on the roll in time for .tha first ed
primary. Are they to be deprived. for his
this reason, of voting in the second pri- his
mary? We say no, and the very fact ag
that a way was provided for them, ba
shows the wisdom and fairness of the b'
primary laws, which is founded on the ane
principle that no white citizen of the an
State should be deprived of his fran
chise. Again, Mr. Miller seems tothink e
that all who took advantage of this plan of
were anti-Bleasites, when the facts in
the case do not warrant any such idea. e
We are informed that out!of four names M
at Easley mills, who 'got orders,' as he M
pe
says, from a Circuit Judge, 'which gave Co
them the right to vote.' three voted for He
Blease. Of the seventeen who voted at H
the Easley city box, some were doubt- w
less for Blease. The Progress is also in
informed that a brother-in-law of Mr. in
Miller who was out of the state at the
first primary, went to Pickens on the hi
12th and applied for an 'order' atd was hC
refused on the ground that it was~then 191
too late, as the books had already been
turned over to the managers. This par
ty, we understand, intended voting for Hi
Manning. ng
"Again, Mr. Miller charges in a veil- 'nc
ed way, that it was a trick to defeat hat
Blease, by rounding up, purchasing, or no
intimidating or making drunk, or by ful
some other process, some 5,000 people to I
who had neglected to register for the lea
first primary. If the Manning-ites had one
been disposed to purchase votes, they ter
would have had to purchase them from the
the Blease supporters or have imported pol
them from another state. Is it any
worse to buy than to sell? The facts'
are, this was a fair election; as fair as
any that was ever held in the city of
Easley. All the reason why any candi
date was defeated wvas because- the ing~
majority of the voters (lid not v'ote for ""in
