NF.W YORK, Oct. . The rls- t
Ing of food prices wis impressed
upon thousands of citizens today
by the action of the largest dairy I
restaurant here In advancing I
prices. This corporation which
owns a chain of lunch rooms In I
New York anil other cities added t
5 cents to tho price of all tho
sluplo dishes. I
Bacon and eggs, and ham and I
eggs now cost 30 cents Instead of I
25 mints. A small stnak is 30
cents Instead of 25 cents; plain t
omelette has Jumped from 15 I
conts to 20 cents. All plos from
now on are 10 cents a exit.
Tho wholesale price of sugar (
advaneod from 6 3-4 conts to 7
cents a pound today and the re-
tall price from 7 to 8 cents. Tho (
increased demand resulting from I
the war was given is the rea-
son. t
Tt'I.SA housewives who net new
surprises every time they price
the cver-aeroplaning foodstuffs, gro
oeries, fresh meat sail 1 vegetables,
have the consolation that their sisters
ell over the United States are In the
Fi i.it bewildering predicament.
That Tulsa offors as cheap market
as any other In this section of the
country, or ono might say in any see.
tion of the country, Is the universal
cplrloti of merchants, Jobbers and
produce men of this city. They com
pare prices with other metropolitan
markets and find only a slight do
mnrkation. Highest pri.ics over
known at this season of tho year are
recorded in Tuls-i at pr ? nt.
.Staple foo'is such as butter, eggs
rod cheese, have In thj last year nd
venced nearly 50 per cent.
Naturally, experts Buy. ihe F.uro
penn war has been the great tnflator.
Despite all other reflecting causes the
fact that the old world Is depending
on the I'nited Slates almost entirely
for some commodities has been re
sponsible for tho sky line prices.
General failure of the wheat crop,
of oourse, has hail Its effect. Tho
wheat crop, relative to population, is
the smallest In forty years.
Tor the first time in that period the
cfflciul estimate of the crop Is ac
tually less than the normal home re
quirements. A liberal surplus wna
carried over from the big crop of 191 S,
but it Is rapidly moving out to Ku
rcpe. Some grain men and millers
believe that wheat will bo very scarce
end much higher before another har
vest. Hlarh wheat, of course, means

Cotton for F.xploslves.
The cotton crop Is a little larger
than last year, but It is 2,500,000 bales
short of the average of the past, five

ARE ON THE TRAIL
Advance Theory That Tool
Drives Machines Off
From Stations.
FfH'lt molor cars, three Fords and
ono Stutz roadster, were stolen In
Tulsa between 10 o'clock Tuesday
night and 3 o'clock Wednesday after
noon. Deputies In the county sheriff's
offico bellovo that the thefts are tho
work of an organized band of auto
mobile thieves who have their camp
near tho city. They have initiated a
campaign to tatch members of the
band.
The Stutz roadster, belonging- to
Mrs. Hugh Simmons, 1723 South Hus
ton, was stolen while she was shop
ping lu a downtown store yesterday
afternoon. Mrs. Simmons left the car
In front of the shop and when she re
turned a short timo later It was gone.
As she left the car sho noticed three
young men standing nearby and ap
parently appraising tho machine's
value. Kho has given a description of
them to tho officers. Mrs. Simmons is
a daughter-in-lnw of Mayor J. 11.
Simmons.
A Ford roadster owned by .1. C.
Treat was stolen from In front of The
World building on West Fourth street

Itrcnk Into Oarage)..
Auto thieves broke Into the g.irago
of N. C. Deems, 1114 South Main
streot, some time Tuesday night and

erod by Mr. Deems when he went to
the garage tbout 10:30 o'clock Tues
day night.
The theft of a third Ford car also
was reported to tho sheriff's offico
yesterday. The officials aro working
on a duo which It Is believed will lead
to tho arrest of the motor thieves and
put a stop to this form of crime In
Tulsa.
Information reaching the county of
ficials leads them to believe that tho
real leaders In the organized band sel
dom steal tho oars themselves. Their
plan Is to hire young men to drive off
the cars desired. It is believed that
the cars are taken to some place near
the city where they are dissembled
and the parts sold or fitted to other
cars so as to aid In the disguise. These
are later sold to dealers in this or
other cities.

but surely, he wished to Impress upon

more men for Ihe army and munition
factories. In this conne.-tion he said
h" bad a set tons word of warning tu
give.
"We are not Justified In expecting
to win the war." he said, "unless the
service of every man and woman In
Ihe country Is utilized to the fullest
extent.
"We must be under no delusion,"

cide duration of this great struggle.
We must be prepared to continue for
a lime which can not it preterit hi

"In fact we must prepare for tho
worst while we hope for tho best. We
havi adopted In theory the principle
i f national service. We must see
that w ii put It Into practice because
we want more men and we want thenl
now and eventiiallv we shall want all
who can be spared."

Need of Conscription.
Sir Edward asserts that Ihe situa
titn is such Mi.it without conscrip
tion In Ireland it will be impossible
to even maintain Ihe Irish regiments
at the front In their proper strength.
He contends that Ireland could pro
vide am (her half million men of
military aue and asks what the colon
ies ,vh'b'h have undo such sacrifices
for the empire will think of the shirk
ing of Ireland.
While most of the responsible pnll-
tl'lato- an a-rocd that it would be In
ixpedient to attempt to iiiqtlv com
pulsion to Ireland while homo rule Ik
will. held trotu it, nndoubteiilv In tho
present phase of the European wai"
those win- are demanding conscription
hold a strong hand ami the govern
ment iiiii'.- find it difficult to resist
their demaml.
The nationalists In reply to Sir Ed
w ir Carson point out that the colonies
iilrcidv have self government and
hence (hero Is no analogy with the
po-clon of Ireland They nt-rt rt that
Ireland will be found to he a united1
nation In resistance !o compulsion.
The liberal newspapers consider
the au'ltattcn another attempt. to
unseat Premier Asqiiith and contend
that while the compulsion in Ireland
would provide a few men It would
provoke another first-class Irish
crins ami throw Ireland into the
hands of the Sinn l-'elners.
