Altoona, Pa., Oct. s.—One man was killed, another is missing
and more than a score of persons, including eight mail clerks, were
more or less injured when the Mercantile Express on the Pennsyl
vania Railroad crashed into the rear of a stock train at the west end
of the Lewistown yards. The express was attempting to make up
lifty minutes lost time between Pittsburgh and New York at the
time of the wreck, it is reported, and the engineer failed to see a red
signal, owing to a prevailing fog. Traffic was blocked for more than
four hours.
The man killed was Scott Eichel
berger. of Altoona, Pa-, conductor of
the stock train. His body was recov
ered from beneath a mass of twisted
steel by a wrecking crew hurriedly
sent to the scene. The missing man.
supposed to have been cremated when
fire broke out in the debris of seven
cattle cars, was a drover. The ex
press was composed of steel cars and
this was responsible for the fact that
there was no fatalities among the pas
sengers. Those injured suffered prin
cipally from shock and bruises sus
tained in being hurled about the cars
by the force of the impact.
The injured, none of whom were
seriously hurt except Engineer J. E.
Stewart, included:
J. E. Stewart. Tyrone, passenger
engineer, badly scalded; D. D. Blot
tenburger, Altoona. passenger fire
man; the following mail clerks, R. X.

J. A. Moll, Lancaster; W. W. Xey,

The passenger train was rushing
through the yards when the lights of
the stock train were seen directly in
front as it pulled through on a cross
over. Engineman J. E. Stewart, of Ty
rone, at once applied the emergency
brakes, but was unable to stop the
train and it crashed into the rear of
the freight. The engine went over the
bank, carrying the engineer with it and
two mail cars were derailed.
Fire La Wreckage
The freight train crumpled and four
cabin cars and three stock cars were
strewn across the tracks, completely
blocking traffic. Almost Instantly fire
broke out in the wreckage and while

ing to extinguish the flames.
Many of the passengers assisted in '
the work when it became known that :
Freight Conductor Scott C. Eichel- j
berger, of Altoona, and a drover were
missing and were believed to be burn
| ing up in the wreck, but their efforts
availed little as the cars blazed fiercely.
No less than a dozen of the passengers
had been injured when the trains
struck, but none seriously. Injuries i
among the mail clerks also were slight. p
One track was finally cleared shortly |
before six o'clock and tho fire was \
finally extinguished.
Itauiilne in Thick Fog
The stock train had orders to move '
'to a side track and was crossing over
the switches when the express train
, struck It. The accident occurred in a |
thick fog. A special committee of rail- j
road officials has been appointed to in- ,
vestigate the accident.
Frank Gable, a passenger on the
wrecked express train, to-day gave de- |
tails of the wreck. He said the ex
press left Pittsburgh last night about j
fifty minutes late. The engineer, he j
said, evidently did not see the green |
i caution signal and did not see the red
danger signal until it was too late. He ■
said that no passenger was seriously
hurt. Many of the hogs in the wrecked
stock train were cremated; and others
i got away and disappeared in the sur
-1 rounding country.
The Mercantile Express was due in
Harrisburg at 1.45 a. m.
Physicians and surgeons from
; Huntingdon, and Mifflin,
were rushed to the scene of the wreck
in a special train.
The passenger train, made up of
; engine No. 3320. two mail cars, two
j baggage cars, on day coach, and two
> sleepers,was In charged of J.E.Stewart
| of Tyrone, engineer; B. D. Blacken
j berger, fireman and J. B. Snyder, con
| ductor, both of Harrisburg. T. S. Ew
ing of Altoona was engineer of the
, freight, with engine 1475. He was
1 hauling what was known as "W. p."
' freight No. 10, running on a prefer
j ence schedule.
Another train was run from Hunt
ingdon to the wreck to take care of
the passengers who were sent east
ward byway of Lewistown Junction
and Sunbury.

are missing and are believed to have
I perished, and an assistant nurse, who

land Brother Clemens, 72 years old.
j Their room on the fifth floor of the
| Intlrmary was swept by fire. It is be-
I lieved neither could have reaped.
The assistant nurse who was in
i iured was Lewis Nolean, who jumped
| from a fifth story window in the in
! firmary as firemen were climbing lad
-1 ders to rescue him. His injuries may
i prove fatal.
The fire was discovered by the col
lege registrar as he was walking up

mack and Clemens were being attend
ied by Nolan. At the time more than
' 100 boarding students and thirty or
j forty members of the faculty were at
i breakfast. The registrar saw flames
I creeping across the fifth floor and gave
i the alarm.
Students and faculty members who
were in the dining room rushed from
! the building, but at that time the fifth
floor was cut off. A crowd gathered
! on the campus saw Nolean climb to
i the window sill and leap.
About noon the fifth floor of the col
' lege building collapsed and seven to
j twenty firemen plunged to the base
