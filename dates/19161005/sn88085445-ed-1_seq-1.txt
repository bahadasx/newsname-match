CITY VALUATION
DROPS $38,000?
Because the aasessed valuation of
Lynden property baa not yet been
computed at the courthouse, Mon
dtv* night tbe city council was un
able to determine the exact amount
of the levy needed to carry on the
city business. The budget, carry
ing with it an estimated amount to
be raised Of $6,858.48, was approv
ed by tbe council.
The county assessor estimates that
the va nation in Lynden will be re
duced approximately $38,000. As a
resu t of this reduction, it Is doubt
ful if the city will be abe to raise
the fu 1 $6,858.48 specified in the
budget, as tlie law will not permit a
kvy higher than that of lost year.
The assessor's office will fix ihe
evy as soon as complete figures are
-ompiled on loca' property.
No protests were made on the
budget Mouduy night, and it waf
mussed without much discussion.
A decrease in property va uationi
'n Whatcom county of $ 1,688,16fi
since last year is shown by the flg
;res compiled for the total assessed
.tropeity for 1916. In 1915 the
valuation was $26,331,091, while
his year it Is $24,642,926.
The total assessab c valuation oi
. ailroad and telegraph property in
this county for 1916 is given a 1
$3,871,684, a decrease of $159,53:
from the va uation of $4,031,222
;iven by th* state tax coin mission
■or 1915. The sum of $20,771,241'
covers the total valuation for iaxa
tion purposes of all properly oul
ilde of the railroad aud te ograpl
