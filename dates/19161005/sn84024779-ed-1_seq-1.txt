The Women's Building
The Woman's Building of the
Richland County Fair is full of
interesting exhibits- The ladies
charge have worked hard to
placc them to the best possible
ad\antage and: have succeeded,
admirably and every department
is well represented with a larger
number and better quality of en
tries than heretofore. The bak
ing department is very much
larger, more varied and of better
quality, more room was needed,
more show cases required, yet it
was over crowded.
The fancy work ,department' is
much larger and better. The ex
hibits being not(only greater but
of a superior quality, each class
being well represented and tho
the beautiful and ornamental, are
everywhere evident the practical
anl useful have not be.:u Ij
sight of its association willi
the artistic and ornammlal has
only added to its value and the
tho this department has not kept
pace with the others but what is
shown is of a high class and each
class is well represented and fair
ly well contested. Tho the high
cost, of products have probably
been a stumbling block in the way
of larger exhibits.
EXTRAORDINARY SCHOOL EHDBIT
BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY IN WOMEirS BUILDING
Cowd Tuesday SnaH—Wednesday Crowd tod
The Eleventh Annual Richland
County Fair opened under ex
tremely doubtful weather con
ditions to a small crowd. This
however, was not unexpected as
the first day under the best
weather and crop conditions
yield, but a small attendance. Tho
exhibits of farm products is
rather below the average but far
better than one would anticipate
in view of the crop conditions in
this county. The stock exhibit
is also much lighter than usual
but makes up in quality what it
lacks in quantity. The exhibits
which are attracting the most at
tention are the displays in the
Women's Building and the School
Exhibit which are both far above
the average. We were delight
ed to hear from a lady resident
of St. Paul that the display iji the
Women's Building has never been
equalled at the Minnesota Stale
Fair.

its full share of the visitors is
the one which contains the Model

of the Thompson Yards, I.nc. This
is the only exhibit of its kind in
existence and is more than worth
while seeing-

The crowd on the second day
of the Fair was 4°od* consider

Prof. Raub in his death defying
triple parachute drop is some,
thing out of the ordinary and is
well worth going miles to see. The
Jap Troupe «jf acrobats and equil

tirely new and novel sensations
which must be seen to~ be appre

The family of clowns are also
very good and afford more than
their share of the amusemnt.
Raoes Feet
The races scheduled for Wed
nesday were the 2:15 pace or
trot and the 2:25 pace. Both
races were filled but some mis
understanding arose among the
"horsemen at the last minute con
cerning the 2:15 pace or trot and
all but one of them refused to go
on. The entry that was not
scratched was "Electric Patch,"
son of the famous Dan Patch a.id
he was brought out and introd
uced to the Grand Stand and allow
ed to trot an exhibition mile.
While the crowd was dissapointed
in not witnessing the 2:15 class
they all understood that the Fair
Association was not to blame in
any particular and all took their
dissapointment good-naturedly
Arrangements were made to fill in
a race in place of the scratced
race and the entries were Baroi
Gopher, Zio Bang- and Carrie
Nation and finished in the order
named Baron Gopher, driven by
the fourteen year old sq.ii of Mjr.
Smith-rrf FargOj wi*lning in three
straight heats.
The entries in the 2:25 pace
were Rena Gano, Interstate, Lady
Logan and Little Wonder- Rena
Gano after winning two straight
heats and leading to the half in
the third heat broke her cart and
was distanced, thus putting her
out of the running, much to the
dissapointment of the spectators
was
a"d
finally won by Lady Logan
money was divided as follows
Lady Logan, first Little Wonder,
second and Interstate third.
The Motoreyele Raoes
The Motorcycle Race was a
hummer and was neck and neck
for the last three miles between
