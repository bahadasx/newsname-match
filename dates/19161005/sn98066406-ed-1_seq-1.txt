MY HERO
By Dorothy Drouyor
1 was swinging lazily on a twig of
the old willow tree, whose drooping
branches almost touched the mud
dy waters ol the old mill stream.
My dinner, which consisted of a nice
juicy worm and a big fat beetle made
me feel kleepy and growing tired of
watching the rushing, turbulent Hood
beneath me, I had nearly dozed oil
when I heard the pleading bark of a
dog and the cross protests of a child.
Opening one eye and cocking my
head at an angle, I saw coming across
the tield from the bite white house on
the hill, a little curly-haired girl, whose
pretty face was distorted with scowls;
and behind her a massive St. Bernard
dog, who held the hem of her dainty
dress in his teeth and was gently pul
ling, although not hard enough to tear
the lacy fabric. She kept scolding her
hinderer and saying "go back, doggie,
go back."
They advanced slowly, the dog pull
ing one way, the child the other, but as
there was no immediate danger, the
beast did not hold her back altogether.
When they reached the bank of the
stream the child clapped her hands in
glee and cried, "Me go. wade; oh, ho!
me go wade."
liy this timt) 1 was wide awake and
1 grew almost frautic when I saw the
little girl sit down in the mud and be
gin to pull oil her little white button
boots and light stockings. Oh I how 1
wished that I were one of those mur
derous bird-killing boys, for then 1
might rescue that sweet baby below
me. Hut, alas, 1 was nothing but a
fed song-sparrow and could lift no
more than one of the child's soft
brown curls.
Just as Bhe was pulling off the sec
ond Ehoe and stocking, a woman ap
peared on the veranda of the big white
house, and 1 could hear her calling,
"Amy, Amy," and could see her look
ing anxiously about.
My feathers stood up all over, 1 was
so excited for fear that she would not
eatch sigh of her little girl. JJut after
a moment she did see her, and as she
ran down the Eteps and across the Held
toward us, her feet seemed scarcely to
touch the ground. '
Amy happened to look up and 6ee
her coming. Laughing with delight as
if this was a new game the child sprang
up and away from her mother. Hut
the bank was covered with slippery
mud and the little girl fell, rolling and
sliding into the dark waters of the
flooded pond.
My heart seemed to stop beating and
the mother's face was white as death.
Hut I, and 1 think the mother too, had
forgotten that the dog came with the
child, and before the water cytred the
tiny girl, the great beast had sprung
into the water and th y b jih sank to
gether The poor little mother was by
this'time i. early wild and 1 heard her
moau, "Oh ! Amy, my baby, my baby."
It seemed ages before they iinally
re appeared, although it could not have
been more than a few moments. When
they at last arose to the surface, he
had her Bafely, her dress gripped vise
like in his great jiws. He scrambled,
dripping and panting up the bank, and
laid the little one at her mother's feet.
As for the mother, she stooped and
gathered her darling into her arms and
covered her face with kisses. The lit
tle thing was weak from fright, but
she was conscious and Bhe drew from
her mother and patted the dog with
her little dimpled hand, saying, "Good
doggie, to tl9h Amy out." Her mother
gave a trembly little laugh aud putting
both arms about the huge intelligent
animal she cried, "Oh ! my brave dog;
my hero, my hero." And 1 heard the
little one, as she nestled to her mother,
softly whisper, "My hero, too."

An Agreeable Surprise.
Members of Georgia Heavis' class in
the Presbyterian Sunday school con
ceived the splendid idea of taking the
makiu's of a good meal, go to her house
on Tuesday aud altogether enjoy one
more happy occasion with her before
her removal to Lausiug.
The ten young ladies carried out the
idea and arriyed at the house ladeu
with parcels, only to find no one ul
home. Then there was a scampering
to the neighbors and their telephones
and all the Bmall boys nearby were sent
on a hunt to find the would-be hostess
of this auspicious occasion. At last
she was found and dragged away from
the supper table at Mrs. Spencer's
where she was just sitting down as an
invited guest.
After that with big sighs of relief at
the narrow escape from having a party
with the honored one left out, all went
to work and the pot-luck supper creat
ed much fun.
As a little token of remembrance the
class gave Georgia a pretty cut glass
vase.
L. B. S. Gathering.
Twenty-four members of the L. R. S.
of the Presbyterian church held a social
afternoon at the home of Mrs. Helen
Reid on Monday. The occasion was

to Detroit this week.
Sewing and conversation occupied
the time until the supper hour when a
bounteous pot luck meal was served.
An engraved sterling silver teaspoon
was presented to Mrs. Harrington as a
memory token, and showing in a slight
manner, the appreciation of the mem
ben of her faithful work among them.

ing at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fred

PREPARE THE
CHILDREN FOR
LATER YEARS
'J'lTERE is no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can afford to
spend. .
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will 'Willie hare to forego fau dreams of being civil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training iht has been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after school
years are pawed to tale their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Bank your money or better still, de
posit little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
comet there will be no necessary "skimping" to start them off right.
