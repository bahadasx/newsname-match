'<?MS Branch, N. J.?President Wilsob's

ion day partly was completed at a
conference that he held with. Chairman
Vance C. McCormick. The
Proaldent also discussed politics with
Henry Ford, automobile manufacturer.

would he made. Henry Ford
remained with the President four
hours and assured Mr. Wilson that
he was willing to do everything possible
to bring about his selection.
Ho said he bad made no plans for
contributing to the Democratic rajnpaign
fund because he did not believe
in such a course. "I think the
# office should seek the man. not the
man tho office," declared Mr. Ford.
Secretary McAdoo who hud planned
to mako several political speeches,
probably will not carry out his plans
because of public business.

iKwvrd and the board created by Congross
to observe tho workings of tho
eight-hour law for railroad employes.
Two of the members of the shipping
board probably will be Bernard linker

NEUTRALITY OF SWEDEN IS
NOW ATTRACTING ATTENTION.

Country Not So Loyal and Impartial
as It Should Be.
London.?The relations between
Swndon and the Entente Powers nre
attracting unusual attention here
and there Is every indication that the
situation threatens to become some)
what tense. With the dispute as to
mall seizures still unsettled there
now has arisen the charge by the EnI
tento Allies that the neutrality of
. ' Sweden Is not so loyal and impartial
i* ii should be. This has drawn
from Stockholm a reply as tart and
crisp as some of the notes in the mail
ontrovorsy which were characterized
by Viscount Grey as containing words
not usually found in diplomatic correspondence.
Tim new point of contact with
Sweden is the outgrowth of tho practice
of belligerent shipping in using
Swedish territorial waters for all Haltie
traffic. Within tho safety of this
ai mi rn iuiu) mini, I'.lll' lilllU illlll
other Entente Nations have sailed
defiantly in and out of the Baltic
paying not the slightest hoed to the
German fleet looking on from the
eater waters. Similarly German merchant
ships have sailed up and down
the west roast of Sweden, heavily
laden with foodstuffs and iron ores,
whilo Russian destroyers in the northem
reaches of the Baltic have been
important to act.

against London and the east coast of
England was very spectacular. An
airship wan brought down in flames
north of London, according to the
official statement.
The statement reads:
"A number of hostile airships crossed
the east coast between 9 o'clock
and midnight. A few bombs were
dropped near the coast, but no damage
is yet reported.
"An airship is reported brought
down in flames north of London."
A later dispatch conveyed this information
:
"Great crows cheered the speci

fell in the London district. The great
flare from the burning aircraft was
visible for a long distance.
Graphic accounts of the manner in
which ^the Zeppelin?the fourth to

CARSANZA'S FAILURE TO RUN

In Negotiations of U. S. and Mexican
Commission Relative to Improved
Border Conditions.
Atlantic City. N. J. Representatives
of the more important American
mining Interests in Mexico are ex;
pected to appear before the American
members of the Mexican-American
Joint Commission here in support
of a memorandum already submitted
regarding conditions in Mexico.
Before they are received, the
commissioners will hold their first
joint session here In continuation of
the discussions begun at New London
four weeks ago.
Consideration of nlnns for thn
maintenance of peace along the Mexican-American
border will be resumed.
but reports which continue* to
arrive of Villa's activity in Chihauhua
may serve as a further delay to
agreement. The commissioners make
no secret of the fact that failure of
General Carranza's forces to run
1 down Villa lias proved embarrassing
to them in considering means for
improving border conditions.
It was considered probable that
General Carranza's latest electornl
decree would be discussed. A copy
of the decree has reac hed the American
commissioners from Washington
and while the details of the document
have not been revealed, it is said to
stipulate that none of those connectovnn

VILLA BANDITS EXECUTED I
HEAVY CASUALTIES WERE ALSO
SUFFERED BY THE CARRANZA
FORCES.
Important Mining Center Southwest
of Chihuahua City.?Baulelio Uribe,
Villa Leader, Was Originator of the
New Idea.
Chihuahua City, Mexico. ? More
than 100 Villa followers were killed,
tho bandit lender Itaudelio ITribe,
was taken prisoner and heavy casu- j
cities were suffered by Carranzn :
forces in a terrific light at Cusihuiri- j
achic, an important mining center !
about 50 miles southwest of Chihuahua
City, according to a message received
by General Trevino from Gen.
Matins Ramos, who was himself
slightly wounded.
Details of tho fight wore few and
were appended to the request of j
General Ramos for surgeons and
medical supplies. A hospital corps
d tachment was accordingly rushed
to tin; scene by train.
It is stated that the garrison at
Cushihuiriachic co-operated with tho
forces of Ramos hut whether they
wore attacked or had been the aggressors
does not appear.
ilanudelio ITribe, leader of the band
and Villa's chief lieutenant, was the
originator of the idea of cutting oft
the ears of captured Government sol- I
(tiers. Many others of his command
are reported to have been made prisoners.
News of the fight was niso rei-eivod
here from the telegraph operator at
Santa Isabel who added nothing to
the report of General Ramos. The
general's official report was sent by
way of that town to which the hospital
train has been dispatched. Santa
Isabel is 33 miles by train from
Chihuahua. The Mexico Northwest
em Railway makes a loop to Cusihuiriachic
front Santa Isabel, while
the direct distance between the two
towns is about 35 miles.
CHEMISTS FIND IN ALCOHOL
LIKELY GAS SUBSTITUTE.

Material Available for Manufacture
Each Year.
Now York.?Increased industrial
value of alcohol and the possibility of
lis substitution for gasoline in the i
near future were discussed here by I
chemists attending the National Kx- j
position of Chemical industries.
"The only fuel in sight which prom- '
isos to take the place or hold down
the price of gasoline, is alchohol,"
said Dr. Arthur D. Little of Boston,
who presided at the conference.
Doctor Little declared that benzol,
which had been suggested as a substitute
for gasoline, in engines, is not !
sufficiently plentiful to keep the 3,000,000
automobiles in this country
going for two days. Kerosene, he
added, was out of the question.
Doctor Little said that in the yellow
pine district alono there is
enough material wasted to make 000,000
gallons of alcohol a day.
"There are 10.000.000 tons of material
available every year in this
country from which alcohol can be
made." lie declared.

Now York.?Although labor loaders
insisted thut the general strike of j
trades unionists in the Greater City

places September G. eventually would \
involve at least 500.000 workers, |
there were no surface Indications of ;
a tie-up of the city's industries, as
threatened, after announcement was
made that the strike had begun.
While the union leaders claimed
that 125.000 workers in various
trades already had joined the movement
with twice as many more ready
to "walk out," the police said they
had received no reports to substantiate
any such estimates. The actual
situation, it was said, was confused
bee ause of Jewish holidays, which
are being celebrated here by more
than 100,000 union workers.
Leaders of the Amalgamated Association
of Street and Electric Railway
employes, whose members are
on strike, were encouraged over the
possibility of the Brotherhood of
locomotive Engineers coming to
their aid. Officials of that organization
notified the Public Service Com
mission during the day that Theodore
P. Shouts, president of the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company,
bad refused to see them and discuss
alleged grievances of motormen in
the employ of the Interborough who
are members of that hrotherhood.
Mr. Shouts declared, however, that
there were no differences between

VO RESTORE OLD STATE ROAD I
Federal Engineers Regard Project to
Rehabilitate Famous Old Highway
as Entirely Feasible.
Columbia Kfforts that have been
under way for some time to reconstruct
and reopen the direct line from
Oolumbla to Charleston, known as
the Old State road, took definite
shape In Columbia at a conference
held at the offices of the department
of agriculture, commerce and industries.
Much enthusiasm was muni- 1
festad. and the next ten days will tell
the tale as to whether or not a proper
main highway will be opened from
the city of Charleston in time for the
fall and winter traffic.
The conference was called by
Commissioner Watson, who has been
co-operating with the central committee
formed at a meeting some
weeks ago at Holly Hill for the pur
pose of going over the entire sit nation
and seeing whether it was considered
wortli while to attenpt to do
with the old state road what was accomplished
Inst season with the Appalachian
highway.
There was present at the conference:
James O'Hear; Held Whitford,
secretary and engineer of the Charleston
sanitary and drainage commission;
Jenkins Robinson; \V. K.
McDowell and William llurgeson, the
highway committee of the Chamber
of Commerce of Charleston; William
Prampton, representing Samuel (J.
Stoney, president of the South Carolina
Agricultural society of Charleston;
John It. Wiggins and A. it. Heunett
of Holly 11111. representing the
midsection organization; John W.
Lillard and William Otis of Columbia.
representing the Columbia Chamber
of Commerce, and others.
Commissioner Watson, in outlining
the purpose of the conference, stated
that United States Highway Engineer
Scales and United States Drainage
Engineer Kuson had completed
their surveys and examinations of
the territory and had presented gratifying
reports indicating that the road
could be rehabilitated and put' in ex
cellent all the year round condition
at the cost of only a few thousand
i dollars.
It was manifest, he said, that the
only way that any highway could bo
, established connecting the most important
and attractive city in the
Miiin? >viin iin* capital mui tiii- interior,
possibly for years to come, was.
through the means of u combined
effort on the part of the people of
the towns and cities concerned and
tho people living along the line; that
the people had been waiting for years
I for something to he done, and there
was not a single connection worthy
I of the name of highway between the
coast, the capital and the interior,
i The people around Holly Hill and In
! that section had already manifested
an absorbing interest, had raised considerable
money an '. had pledged
contributions of teams and labor,
and it was simply now a question as
to whether or not those who would
benefit from the repotting of the highway
and the turning of the tide of
traffic in that direction w; hod to
pull together in one general move
ment to push tin thine through

15 to 17 inclusive The fir t
fair, held las>t fall, was such a -ignnl
success that every one is stimulated
to strive for a still greater success

association reports were received from
! the various sections of the county
and definite plans were adopted for
the successful holding of the next fair.
Much interest is being manifested and
