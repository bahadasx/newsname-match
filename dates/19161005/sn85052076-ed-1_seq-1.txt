Honesty Is the Best Policy
"That man don't know why I don't trade with him."
"What is the i-i-ason;'"
"Why, you see he has cheated the eople he dealt
with, and I know it. He thinks it was all covered up, but
it isn't, and now I don't propose. to do business with a
man that has to be looked out for. There's plenty of hon
est folks to do business with."
This little dialog shows that a "smart man" is often
not as smart as he thinks. Beat your neighbor in a bar
pain or a trade if you want to and can, but the chances
are you will cut yourself out of much more than you
make by it. Honesty is the best policy.
Mountain Day
Once a year the Berea students take a day for visit
ing the mountains. Incidentally they visit each other, and
teachers and students improve their acquaintance.
ltst Monday was the day for this year, and with
Wednesday for the opening of' Kentucky Hall this has
been a festive week.
But the mountains are beautiful! The rugped out
lines, softened by foliage and touched with Autumn
color, show us that (iod is a great Gardener.
Great Men Go
We hope God has his eye upon boys and young
men who will fill the places made vacant by death!
Seth Low, former mayor of New York, and President
of Columbia University, for years the first citien of Amer
ica's first city, has just died.
Josiah Strong, author of "Our Country," and the first
to lead in considering the present problems of American
life, finished his useful life last spring.
Horace. White, one of the early graduates of Beloit
College, long editor of the Nation, is another great man
just leaving this world.
The memory of these men is an incentive to every
young student.

ing God's Law for the world in rays
of light poured into his brain. Our

And now let us look again at our
third pnnel, to learn How to Save a
"Tn-agw" Boy. In this painting
by Raphael, most people have fixed
their eyes on the Transllguratioii of
Christ as a theological display of
His divinity, and have thought the
picture below it of the demoniac
boy, healed the next morning as
Jesus came down from the Mount,
a mere bit of artist's license or a
curious marginal note. Hut a careful
look will show that the Transfigura
tion of Christ is not the foreground
of the picture. It is rather the
power behind the scene. The fore
ground, (N ciipying two-thirds of the
picture, is the demoniac boy, trans
figured into agony and hideoiisness
and misery by the devil, with whom
he is struggling for deliverance, in
VH 111.
The nine lesser apostles, to whom
the father had brought his boy for
heating while their Master was in
the MiMiiit of Traiisllguralion, have
proved too weak in faith to over
match the demons. However, An

a teacher would call "the point of
