At evvry stop between Pittsburgh,

rear platform of his private car. waved
to the crowds, explained that be was
making no speeches, and then shook
hands with as many as possible.
| "I am before the Jury and can't say
anything." was the way he explained
his failure to speak in several towns,
i "I am not making a speech-making
campaign." said the President at Lima,
Ohio, "but It touches me and gratifies
me very much to get the greetings !
have all along the line, and Ohio has
certainly shown her hospitality."
"We didn't want a speech; we want
1'? on:- President," a man called
out.
' 1 don't tl ink much of my speorh
tnaking, but I t unk it is better than
I am to look at." Mr. Wilson said.
"We want t.. see Mrs. Wilson," a
man shouted
"I'll admit site is better worth look

"I heard a Republican say to-day he

When the President stopped at Val
paraiso, 1ml., to-night, a crowd. In
cluding some students, drew him into
a reference to .Mr. Hughes's whiskers. I
"I haven't any speech to make," said
Mr. Wilson. "I have never met you
before, but your manners are very
familiar. 1 am glad to see you."
A man in the crowd called out,
"Aren't we glad lie hasn't got whis
kers!"
' i uii are a clean-shaven crowd your
self," replied the President.
At Fort Wayne, the lirst stop in
Indiana, Mr. W ilson said:
"I haven't anything to say, my fel- I
low-citizens except that it is exceed
ingly refreshing io get awa.v from otli
dal duties, and out among the folks
again, and the sort of greeting you are)
giving me tills my heart with a great
ileal of gratitude. I am heartily obliged
[to you."
A railroad hrakeman. just off duty, |
pushed out his hand and said: "Right
there. -Mr. President. She's dirty, but
she's going to hit the rooster hard."
At Waisaw, liul., the President said:
"It cheers me very much to have you
come out and give me such a^greeting.
because sometimes when I am hard at
work I long very much to get away
and conic out and see the folks. It
gives mo the deepest gratitude, as if
you wanted to see me and believe in

Kdward O. Hoffman, of Fort Wayne,
Democratic Xational Committeeman
from Indiana, rode for a while with
the President, and later gave out an
informal statement in which he claimed '
that Indiana would cast its electoral
vole for Wilson.
"The President has a large personal
following among Indiana Republicans,"
Mr. Hoffman said. "The independent!
vote is for him, and he Is assured of
per cent of the Progressive votes.
Our citizens do . ioi believe in swap
ping horses in the middle of the

The President will make at least two
speeches in Omaha to-morrow, one at

With tho French and British before
the Gorman fourth line, after moro
tli.; n two months of almost continuous
lighting, the autumn storms, for which
i i'icardy is famous, brought a tomporuiy
lull in operations of the Sommc.
Rain fell for the greater part of the
J day, and it was only between showers
? that the allied artillery could carry on
i its "softening" process against tho new
line of defenses which the infantry now
faces. There wero scattered engage
ineiiis of a violent, but local, character.
I'm iner the night tho British regained
complete possession of Eaucourt I'Ab
b.iye. while the French carried a power
ful line of Held fortifications extending
from a point near Morval to St. Piorre
Vaast woods. During the day tho
French advanced still further east of
Morval.
In .i recapltuatlon of tho events of
I the last two uioiiths General Haig to

j hold .ill tlie commanding heights south
of the Ancre to the point where their
. line joins that of the French, and that
' m the course ..f tho I'icardy battle fully

.action. His intimation is strong that
the Teutons have not sufficient reserves
. to Ioiiji bear such wastage, and that
future operations will become*' lighter
in ratio to the itr.iin on tne iicrnmns.
Against this, in i review of the situa

i estimates the allied losses at from 700,
