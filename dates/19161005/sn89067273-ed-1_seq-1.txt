MRS. PELTZER
FULL VERDICT
One of Most Noted Trials Ever Held
. In County Defendant Contend
Man Falling from Window Was
Not Accidental.
The Peltzer case, which came by
change of venue from Kansas City,
and which occupied the attention of
the Circuit Court 11 days and part of
several nights, came to a close last
Saturday afternoon.
. Mrs. Peltzer, the plaintiff, was giv
en a verdict of $30,845 on insurance
policy, as principal and interest, and
$5,000 for lawyer's fees. The Jury
stood 11 to 1 for Mrs. Peltzer, the 11
men signing the verdict. The jury
was out about three hours and every
ballot stood the same, one man stand
ing alone to the last.
The issue the Jury was to decide
was whether F. C. Peltzer's falling
from his office window in Kansas
City a year ago down five stories
was accidental. Peltzer was Insured
with the London Guarantee and ac
cident Co., for $30,000. Mrs. Peltzer
the wife, sued for the face of the pol
icy, $30,000, $6,000 for lawyer's fee
and $3,000 "for vexatious refusal to
pay."
The trial drew many persons to
(he court room from day to day. It
was one of the moot noted canes ever
Iried in the county. The array aof lo
gal talent on. both sides was strong,
and the trial was a battle royal from
beginning to end. Frank V. Walsh,
for the plaintiff, ,was great, and Battle
McCardle, for the defense, tho on
the losig side, fought to the last
ditch. Prosecuting Attorney, A. C.
Whitson assisted the plaintiff, while
Senator R. D. Kodgers and Fry &
Fry were for the defendant.
It was one case where the mem
bers of the Jury enjoyed their task.
"It was a big case and the finest le
gal talent in the State, and we had
opportunity to learn something," one
of the jurymen said.
The jury in the case was composed
of the following: A. O. Bogan, H.
A. Doyle, G. P. Maxwell, H. V. Sned
eker, R. S. Mechlin, W. H. Morris,
Harry Householder, Hiram Threld
keld, J. B. Owen, Dr. W. F. Taylor,
Joe Berry, and J. B. Woolery.

" TO ORGANIZE
Henry Leo of RurIi Hill was dis
cussing the Brotherhood strike a
few days ago. These thoughts were
suggested: " .
Maybe the Brotherhood forced
Congress' and most likely it did not.
Neither organized labor nor the rail
road magnates control in this coun
try. It is the farmer who rules.
True enough the lamer Is not or
ganized. But he is going to organ
ize, - Partisan politics will not be
allowed to come in, either, and break
up his organization, as it did in the'
case of the Farmers Alliance and the
Wheel a quarter of a century ago. .
As it is, the farmer has no say as
to what he shall receive for his pro
duce. If he buys supplies on the
market again he has no say.
Organization and effective co
operation will stop this. Then In
deed it wll be the farmer ruling. 1
The farmer has much to learn.
But he is beginning to discover him
self. The American farmer is not!
up, even, with the Chinese farmer.
In that country a half-acre of land
will keep one person in plenty while
in this country It requires twenty
times that acreage to feed one per
son. We have let our soil run down,
and we have used it less than a hun
dred years. The Chinese farmer has
used his land forty centuries and
finds it indestructible.
We are going to be more careful
and scientific in the cultivation of
land we're going to learn from the
Chinaman. In addition, we're going
to learn co-operation and organiza
tion from the German farmer.
As suggested above, the - farmer
buys supplies at too nigh a price and
sells his produce to middlemen at too
low a price.
: The farmer is going to organize.
and he's going to stay -. organised.
His slogan will be: "Stick, Brother,
stick." Then you will see who rules
in this country.
