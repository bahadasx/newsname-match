"There is more Catarrh in the
cection of the country than any
other diseases put together, and
for years it was supposed to be
incurable. Doctors prescribed
local remedies, and by constant
failing to cure with local treat
ment, pronounced it incurable.
Catarrh is a local disease, great
ly , influenced by constitutional
conditions and therefore required
constitutional treatment. Hall's
Catarrh Medicine, manufactured
by F. J. Cheney & Co., Toledo,
Ohio, is a constitutional remedy,
is -taken internally an d acts
through the Blood on the Much
ous Surfaces of the System. One
Hundred Dollars reward is off er-;

tarrh Medicine fails to cure.

The Glories of the Night.
: (Delia Ransom Gannaway, in Southern Standard.) v
As I stood upon the rustic bridge, alone, Z
Gazing into the pellucid waters below,
God's evening Ump arose and brightly it shorn,
, Warming mv sad heart by its ethereal glow,
0, glorious moon; O, scene subh'me and rare,:
Remain as a beacon in my life's darkened night,
Dispelling ominous clouds of despa ir
From my saddened heart by your glorious searchlight.
Peaceful river flowing with euphonic sound ;
A motive pouter to set to music life's song; )
With waves glistening bright as onward you bound,
0, do thou wash from my heart all semblance of wrong.
