Tho writer has visited many
schools in Eastern Kentucky but the
finest school ever visited was tho
one taught by Prof. Ringo on East
Fork of Slate in Menefce county.
It would pay every teacher in Pow
ell county to visit that school and
see what can be done by a teacher
who really teaches. From the min
ute the writer stepped into the room
there was not a whisper heard and
during tho two hours he was there
there was hardly a noise heard but
every pupil was busy studying his
or her lesson. Not n pupil left the
room nor did they keep going up to
tho teacher asking questions or
wanting to kuow what this or that
word was. There was perfect or
der everywhere. -But tho best part
of the school was in the reciting of
their lessons. It was wonderful tho
way those second grade pupils read
from their readers. They ncyer
stumbled on. a word, nor did they
read in n sing song tono us a ma
jority of children da. They gave
the right emphasis and lnllectioiijon
every word.. If ikvi right inflection
Fiscal Court Meets.
The Powell Fiscal Court met at
its stated October meeting Tues
day. All members of the court
were present, and the allowance
of claims was taken up. A num
ber of these were passed upon by
the Court in tho forenoon. In
the afternoon tho court was buey
making settlements with various
officers. Tho road question was
not entered into, as an early de
cision of the Court of Appeals
upon the-iiiestion of the legality
of a road commission in the coun
ty is expected, so the matter was
deferred uutil such decision could
be had. The case which has been
appealed we learn has Geeii 6et
for a heariug by the Court of Ap
peals October 12. Soon after this
date the Fiscal Court1 will come
together again and take up its
unfinished business, and tho road
business also, provided the decis
ion of Judge Shackelford to the
ell'ect that a road commission iu
Powell is illegal, is upheld by the
Court of Appeals.
was not given the first reading, the
teacher made them read it over un
til they did bring out the right one.
It was a delight to hear the several
grades read. The higher the grade,
the more improvement there was.
And such writing as those pupils
did. Evercy word was written on
the board neatly, np ziaging,up
andtcojvnf( bpt every .JqUer sym- (
meTrjpaTand the right height. Why,
they could beat a majority of the
older students to-day in our col
leges in writing. The room was.
clean and neat, no papers scattered
over the room, every book in place,
every pupil taking pride in the or
der and looks of the room. Is it
any wonder that this teacher has
no trouble in having a room full of
children. And how they love that
teacher. Strict he is, but they ap
preciate his strictness. And the
patrons of that district appreciate
Prof. Ringo so much that dach pa
tron pays him one dollar extra that
he may teach their school. If they
had to give him five dollars or ten
dollars extra, it would pay them in
big returns. Prof. Ringo seldom if
over uses the switch. Again the
writer says it would pay every
teacher in Powell county to take a
trip over there and visit thai school.
The writer does not intend to cast
reflections on our teachers in our
own county but at the same time
there is wide room for improvement
in many of our schools. Go into
many schools and there is a whis
pering and buzzing sound all over
tho room. The pupils are noiy,
very often going in and out of the
room from, mpming till night, go
ing up to the teacher continually
and asking what this or that word
is, or asking permission to leave tho
room, to speak to another pupil or
to got a drink of water. Papers are
scattered all over tho room; books
all ,ovcr,tjio desk. The childreu
read in a sing song tone and do
not bring1 but the right iiiflcctionst
uid meaning to tho words pud often'
tho teacher never corrects them
Some mtfy think tho writer is rathen
severe in thi3 article but if you will
go with him to sonic schools he has,
visited, ho jtliinks hocan'proxQ tq
you thut h6 1ms notold it all yet.
