Chicago, Oct. 4. Preside-nt Wilson,
penetrating the middle west today for
Ids speech in Omaha tomorrow, re
ceived noisy welcomes from many
thousand persons in Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois. He interpreted the enthus
iasm to one crowd as meaning "you
l.eheve In me." At stop after stop,
the railroad .stations
several places hands
wore packed, al
playeel and fi
niieiitly the president
remarked on the
cordiality.
Itefusing to turn his trip Into u
speech-making tour, the president
nevertheless kept up a running fire
of remarks at every stoji. Interest
among those who spoke to him cet -tcred
most ahout the eight-hour law
for railroad employes.
Mr. Wilson made a hrief stop at
'hicago tonight ami conferred with
Senator Walsh, in charge of demo
cratic western headquarters, Senator
Sutilsliiiry of Delaware, manager of
the senatorial committee, and the
other department heads.
Several hundred persons, including
local politicians, railroad men and not
a few Women, flocked to the train
yards and cheered the president w hen
he appeared and shook hands with
those nearest him.
WuKli (ilvi'H (;od llenorl.
Senator Walsh told him the cam
paign in the west was "more than sat
isfactory." At every stop between Pittshurgh,
passed early this morning, and Chi
cago, the president appeared on lha
rear platform of his private car,
waved to the crowds, explained thit
he was making no speeches and then
shook hands with as many as
Mhle.
pos-
"I am hefore the jury and can't say
anything," was tho way he explained
his failure to speak in .several towns.
"1 am not nink'ng a speech-making
campaign," said the president at Linn,
Ohio, "hut It touches me and gratifies
me very much to get the greetings I
have nil along the line, and Ohio has
certainly shown her hospitality."
"We didn't want a speech; we want
ed to see our president," a man called
out.
Clii crs Fight-1 lour Day.
"Hurrah for the eight-hour day,"
came another voice amid apphi'isc
"1 don't think much of my speech
making, but I think it is hotter thru
1 am to look al." Mr. Wilson said.
"We want to sec Mrs. Wilson," a
man shouted.
"I'll admit she Is better worth look
ing at than 1 am," replied the presi
dent, as he hrought his wife for
ward. "I hearJ-a republican say today ho
was going to vote for you," a" man
called out at Wooster. O.
"He must 1 e a good man," retorted
Mr. Wilson.
"Von were with us in the eight
hour day and we are with you," mid a
man at Orrville, O., a railroad town.
"Hood," the president replied.
When the president stopped ft Val
paraiso, I ml., tonight a c rowd In
cluding some students, drew him Into
a reference to Mr. Hughes' whiskers.
"I haven't any speech to make,"
said Mr. Wilson, "I have never met
vou hefore but your manners ure -i.v
funiiliar. I am mighty glad to see
.vou.
A man in the crowd called out:
"Aren't we glad he hasn't got whis
kers!" "Vou are a clean shaven cr.i-vd
yourself," replied the president.
At Port Wayne the first stop in In
diana, Mr. Wilson said:
"I havent anything to say, my fel
low citizens, except that it is exceeo
inKly refreshing to get away from of
ficial duties and out among the folks
again, and the Rort of greeting vou
are giving me fills my heart with a
treat deal of gratitude. I am heir'
ily obliged to you.'
lirake man shakes llaniD.
A railroad brakeman, just off duty,
pushed out his hand and said;
"'tight there, president. Shi 's dirty,
hut she's going to hit the rooster
hard."

Sir William Cnhcrtson, e hie f of the
imperial staff at ntmy headquarters,
said In a i-pci-eh today at 1 'a lderby,
Lincolnshire-, tliat while the' allies
were winning the war slowly, but
surely, be wished to impri'ss upon his
hearers the necessity of procuring
more men for the army and iiiubi
tiotis factories. ,, this connection, ho
said lie bad a serious word ef warn
ing to give:
"We are not justified in expe-elim;
to win the war," he said, "unless the
service of e very man and woman in
the I'onntry is gtili.ed to the fullest
extent,
"We must be under no delusion as
lo the end or probable duration of this
great struggle. We must be prepari'd
to continue for a time which at pres
1'IM cannot be eletermilied.
"In fact, we must prepare ror the
worst while wi hope for the best. We
have adopted in theory the principle
eif national sen ice'. We must see that
we put It Into practice, bi.causi we
want more men and we want tin
now, and eventually wis shall want
who can lie spared."
