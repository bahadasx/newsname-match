How Catarrh is Contracted.
Mothers arc sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the colds which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and tho child has
chronic catarrh, a disease that is sel
dom cured and that may prove a life's
burden. Many persons who have this
loathsome disease will remember hav
ing hud frequent colds at the time it
was contracted. A little forethought,
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy judiciously used, and all this trou
ble might have been avoided. Obtain
able everywhere.

The hearing on tho motion to
make the temporary injunction
permanent in the somewhat cele
brated Perrysburg sidewalk case
was given a hearing before the
Hon. Judge Piatt on Monday. B. F.
James represented the plaintiff,
while Harrington & Dunn and F.
E. Bowers represented defendants
Bowers.
The court held that J. n. Wilson
was not entitled to an injunction
in the caso because he is not a
property owner on the side of the
street where the sidewalk in ques
tion is located.
Tho plaintiff immediately filed
an appeal bond and the case will
have a hearing in the court of ap
peals. The filing of the appeal operates
as a continuance of the temporary
injunction until after the case is
heard in tho higher court, so the
attorneys claim.

Recent burglaries in neighboring
towns and counties demonstrate the
great need in Perrysburg of a police
officer for night duty in Perrysburg.
Maumee has such an officer and un
less conditions change very soon, Per
rysburg will probably have reason to
regret not having such protector.
If overy business man in towu-would
pledge to contribute to the fund for
his salary, and he would not only be a
protection against burglars, but an
additional safeguard against fire.

A MINUTE'S TALK ABOUT
THE COURT OP APPEALS.
On November 7th the voters of
the 6th Appellate District, coin
posed of Erie, Huron, Sandusky,
Ottawa, "Wood, Fulton, "Williams,
and Lucas counties, will have an
opportunity to vote for one judge
of the Court of Appeals.
This court consists of three
JUDGE S. S. RICHARDS,
Clyde, Ohio.
judges, two of whom live in To
ledo, Lucas county, and one in
Clyde, Sandusky county.
Of the Toledo judges, one lias
four more years to serve, and the
other has two years.
The judge whose first term is
about to expire is Silas S. Richards,
of Sandusky couny, who has effi
ciently and honestly served the Gth
District during his first term.
As will be noticed, Judge Rich
ards is tho only member of the Ap
pellate Court from our district
who does not live in Toledo. lie
is seeking re-election.
It speaks well for Judge Rich
ards that in the seven counties out
side of Lucas tho counties that
contain considerably more than
half of the population, and from
which at least one appellate judge
should come not one man would
run against him.
Judgo Richards' only opponent
is from Toledo. In a thickly popu
lated district containing over 3000
square miles, why centralizo the
Appellate Court in Toledo? It is
a non-partisan office, and in fair
ness should be non-sectional. Let
it remain the Gth Appellate Dis
trict not the Toledo Appellate
District by continuing Judge
Richards on tho bench.

111 the presidential campaign of
1872 the Republican ticket was
headed by (ien. Ulysses S. Grant,
of Illinois, for persident, and Hon.
Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts,
for vice president. In this year
a great many Republicans had be
come dissatisfied with the adminis
tration of the regular organiza
tion, and had seceded. They
formed a little party of their own,
and styled theinselvcs "Liberal Re
publicans." The real cause of
their leaving tho old party I do
not know, nor docs it matter here.
They met, had a convention, and
nominated Horace Greeley, of New
York, for president, and B. Gratis
Brown, of Missouri, for vice presi
dent. The Democratic party made
no nominations at all, but their
convention endorsed the nominees
of the Liberal Republicans.
The campaign of this year was
not nearly as exciting as had been
the one of four years previous.
Both of the parties erected poles
after tho campaign was opened in
due form, and tho customary
speeches were made and rallies
held, also both parties had' their
marching clubs for the usual
torchlight parades. There were
also quite a number of poles erect
ed by private parties during this
campaign, the most noteworthy of
which was a fine hickory pole
raised by tho late John G. Knoll,
near his residence on the north
side of Third street, about midway
between Walnut and Cherry
streets. Mr. Knoll was at one
timo postmaster of our village,
when the postoffice was located on
Front street, where the residence
of Fred Hillebrand now stands.
Another fine pole of this campaign
was the white ash pole erected by
Charlie Kreps, son of George
Kreps, dry goods merchant, at his
home on Second street. This pole
was somewhat unique, in that it
was raised far up in tho branches
of a large tree in the grounds of
the Kreps residence, and though
the polo was not so tall in itself,
the ilag on it was plainly visible
for a long distance. Also in this
campaign it was noticeable that
most of the poles carried two Hags,
one large flag of our country at
the top, and underneath it a long
streamer bearing the names of the
respective candidates. There were
also a great number of poles of
various sizes put up in this cam
paign by mere boys ranging in age
from 10 to 16 years, who knew
nothing of politics, but who
thought the party to which their
father belonged was "the" party.
Whenever any of these poles were
to be raised all of the boys in the
neighborhood turned out to help
tho proceedings, and they usually
went through tho sanlo ceremonies
as did their elders. One of these
poles was the proud possession of
the writer, and consisted of the
longest hickory hoop-pole which
could bo obtained at the stave fac
tory, near the railroad, and the
little Hag (which was presented to
me by my dear old friend, John
Crattic, the one-time general utili
ty man at the old D. & M depot),

Sloan's Liniment for Neuralgia Aches.
The dull throb of neuralgia is uickly
relieved by Sloan's Liniment, tho uni
versal remedy for pain. Easy to apply;
it quickly penetrates without rubbing
and soothes the sore muscles. Cleaner
and more promptly effective than mus
sy plasters or ointment; does not stain
tho skin or clog the pores. For stiff
muscles, chronic rheumatism, gout,
lumbago, sprains and strains it gives
quick relief. Sloan's Liniment reduces
the pain and inflammation in insect
bites, bruises, bumps and other minor
injuries to cnuaren. uot a bottlo to

No, Mr. hunter! You have no
right to tramp over the farms and
shoot upcvery bit of gamo to bo
found, merely because you have a
hunter's license. If you wish to
play safe you must have the writ
ten or verbal consent of the land
owner.
With the amount of inspection
that prevails it is difficult to under
stand how illness of any character
can prevail. The Grocer's advo
cate makes the following cry:
An inspector's in the ice box,
An inspector's on the root,
An inspector's in the stable,
To examine Dobbin's hoof:
An inspector's midst the canned goods,
An inspectors alter germs
Which he thinks aro in the butter,
And another after worms;
For wo swear by sanitation
And the "healers" need the kale,
And the over-taxed consumer
No one listens to his wail.
