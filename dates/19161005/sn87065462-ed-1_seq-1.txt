each of his lectures.
Three times Mr. Ott was honored with
the presidency of the International Ly
ceum Association. lie is author of
"How to Gesture," "How to Use the
Voice," "Sour Grapes" and other vol
umes. Following the appearance of Mr. Ott
in an Ohio city, one of the newspapers
commented as follows: "This city
should be better today, both morally
and physically, as a result of Dr. Ott's
lecture, 'Sour Grapes.' He opened the
eyes of all classes to homely truths,
ordinary truths, but truths which need
an Ott "to give them a picturesque
petting."
The Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser
says, "Dr. Ott simply captured every
man, woman and child in his audi
ence." RALPH BINGHAM.
Ralph Bingham, another number on
the forthcoming entertainment course,

FAIRCHILD LADIES' QUARTET.
The personnel of this company is as
follows:
Bessie Fairchild, pianist and so
prano; Mildred Mercness, cellist and
soprano; Dorothy I'alrchild. violinist
and contralto; Lola I'alrchild, reader,
violinist, contralto and planologlst.
The demand among Lyceum commit
tees everywhere for a quartet of la
dies who, in addition to lieing vocalists,
are versatile upon orchestral instru
ments has been insistent during recent,
years. Few demands of the Lyceum
have been more difficult to fill, which
accounts for the small number of such
companies now on the Itedpath list.
A company may be found which has
the requirements for an instrumental
program, but not good vocalists, and
vice versa.
The members of the Falrchild La
dles' Quartet are both vocalists and
instrumentalists. Their program will
Include instrumental and vocal quar
tets, piano, violin, cello, soprano and

contralto solos, readings, pianologues,
whistling quartets and solos, instru
mental duets and trios and vocal duets.
Dorothy Falrchild, the youngest
member of the company, began her
musical education at the age of seven
years and appeared in public recital
at the age of nine. She is a pupil of
Herbert Butler (American Conserva
tory, Chicago). Last year she was a
member of the Coyla Spring Concert
Company.
Lei a Falrchild studied expression at
the University of Wisconsin and voice
with Magnus Schutz of the Sherwood
School, Chicago. She was a member
of the Spring Concert Company.
Bessie Falrchild studied piano with
Emil Liebllng for a number of years.
She has also taken an active part as a
member of the Rockford (111.) Men
delssohn Club and the Treble Clef
Club of Bel ott, Wis.
Mildred Mcreness studied voice with
Magnus Schutz; also the cello with
well known Chicago teachers.
THE COLLEGIANS.
Many Lyceum courses never arrange
a year's program without including a
male quartet. In many places it has
come to be looked forward to as much
as a Lyceum course itself.
In the Collegians the Kcdpath Bu
reau presents a male quartet which
renders a program without waits, a

program in which there is plenty of
action.
This type of male quartet has filled
an important place in the Lyceum in
the last few years, as it combines not
only good music, but entertainment of
a nature which delights both grownups
and children.
The program of the Collegians also
will consist not only of vocal quartets
and solos, but Instrumental numbers
as well, still further adding variety to
the evening's presentation.

Field Selection of Seed
Agricultural College, Miss.,
Oct. 1. That the seed corn cam
paign for the purpose of stimu
lating the field selection of suffi
cient quantities to seed for a
100,000,000-bushel corn crop in
1917 is daily gaining momentum
and will result in thousands of
"Ola Miss" farmers selecting
seed in the field during the next
few weeks, is the statement giv
en out here today by Assistant
State Agent C. A. Cobb, who is
keeping in touch with the work
in every part of the state.
There will be no let up in the
vigorous campaign for the com
ing weeks, and all agricultural
workers, with the State Bank
ers Association and other forces,
are putting forth renewed efforts.
One banker alone is putting bul
letins on seed corn selection into
the hands of 2,000 farmers in
his community.
Summing up the present grain
situation and its effect on Missis
sippi farmers, Mr. Cobb said:
"We find that the United States
will be short more than a billion
bushels of grain this year, in
cluding shortage in oats, 'corn
and wheat, and we shall have to
grow corn for ourselves because
there will not be a sufficient sup
ply from other sections to look
to for the present.
"The Argetine corn crops is
also short, due to extremely dry
weather in that country. The
Argentine Republic and the Uni
ted States together are practical
ly the only exporters of grains,
and if there is any considerable
demand from other countries it
is going to be difficult to supply
on account of the shortage.
There is only one conclusion,
therefore, and that is that grain
is going to bring an extremely
fancy price. While the Missis
sippi farmers can take care of
of part of the home supply by
planting fall oats, we must pro
duce a bumper corn crop in 1916,
in keeping with our slogan of
'One hundred million bushels.'
"In order to make the seed
corn selection campaign as defi
nite as possible, at our meetings
now being held by our workers
hundreds of farmers are pledg
ing themselves to select seed in
the fields. Already I have been
in many fields where such selec
tion has been made. One corn
club boy, who is now a student
at the A. and M. College, spent
the last several days of his vaca
tion in helping the farmers in
his community in selecting seed
for another year.
"Seed corn will be scarce and
it behooves every farmer to save
enough for the principal part of
his own crop. It is also wise to
buy a few pecks of highly bred
corn to plant a special seed patch
for the coming year."
To those farmers who want to
select seed in the fields, Mr.
Cobb is offering the- following
suggestions:
1. The seed stalk should be
from eight to ten feet tail
2. The base of the stalk
should be large and somewhat
flat
3. The blades of the seed
stalk should be broad and long.
KASAW DRY GOODS
4. The seed stalk should ta
per gently from the base to the
tassel.
5. In all prolific varieties
there should be at least two ful
ly developed ears to each stalk.
6. The ears on the seed stalk
should be well placed, one on
each side of the stalk, about four
feet from the ground.
7. The seed ears should be
borne upon short, stout shanks
four or five inches long, that
permit the ears to hang down.
8. The stalks from which
seed ears are to be selected
should not occupy more than nor
mal room, should not stand at
the end of skips, nor at the end
of the row. Select a stalk that
has fought its way and won.
9. Every stalk in the vicinity
of the seed stalk should be well
fruited. If barren or weak
stalks ( stand near a normal
stalk, the ears from the normal
stalks will not be suitable for
seed.
10. Be careful to select stalks
that are free from disease and
that do not stand near diseased
stalks.
11. Every seed ear should be
snugly covered by' the shuck.

Fire Captains
Here is an interesting ipping
from an American publication in
the year 1854. ; It is entitled
"Five Captains:!'
There' were five captains
chanced to meet one Russion,
one Turk, one Frenchman, one
Americian and one Englishman.
One of these captains proposed a
champagne supper, each cme to
give a tost to his own native
country, or pay for i.the wine
drinks.
The' Russion "Here is to the
stars and bars of Russia, that j
were never pulled down." j
The Turk-"Here is to the!
were never clipped. "
The Frenchman "Here is to
the cock of France, whose feath
ers were never picked."
The American "Here is to the
stars and strips of the United
States of America, who never
failed to defeat." "
. The Englishman "Here is to
the rampant, rip roaring lion of
Great Britain, that tore down the
stars and bars of Russia, clipped
the wings of Turkey, picked the
feathers of the cock of France
and ran like h 1 from the stars
and strips of the United States
of America." Ex.

COMPANY
To the Property Owners of Oko
lona: In as much as the impression
seems to haye gone abroad that
the time in which property own
ers will be required to connect
with the City Sewer System will
be extended, I think it proper to
make this statement.
The ordinance requires all con
nections to be made on or before
January 1st, 1917, and fixes a
penalty for failure to connect
within the time limit.
There is no disposition on the
part of the City Council to ex
tend this time, and any state
ment to the contrary is in error.
There are now several plumbers
in the City who will do the work
properly, and will make reasona
ble terms of payment to proper
ty owners, and I urge property
owners to make their contracts .
as soon as practicable. Those
who delay may find themselves
in the hands of a monopoly,
While those who act promptly
have the benefit of free compe
tition. Any property owner who is
unable to make arrangements
for connection is invited to con
fer with the Mayor. " At? others
are urged to make contracts, and
have their connections made at
once.
