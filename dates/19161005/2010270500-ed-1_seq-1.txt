Dakota City,
September 23rd, 19JG, occurred the
death of another pioneer woman,
who was highly respected and belov
ed by many, and was a devoted wife
and mother. Mrs. Mahon was for
merly Miss Mary Ann Nichols, of
Dubuque, la., coming to Dakota
county with her parents in 1872.
She was joined in holy matrimony to
J. Mahon in 1876, by which union
eight children were born, one dying
in infancy. The surviving children
are Frank Mahon, of Hubbard,
b.; John, Henry, James and
uirles, of Ponca, Neb.; Mrs. Wm.
v..op ally and Mrs. I. Conway, of
Sioux City, la. Mrs. Mahon had a
stroke of appolexy about two weeks

and all that medicine and loving
hands could do was of no avail.
Funeral services were held Tuesday
from the South Creek Catholic
church, conducted by Rev. Fr.
Moore, of Ponca, Rev. Fr. English,
of Hubbard and Rev. Fr. Gleason, of
Willis, and was largely attended.
Sioux City Journal, 30: Late yes
terday afternoon suit was filed at
Dakota City, Neb., by Miss Ruth
Myers, 012 Hickory sdreet, Omaha,
Neb., against Dakota county for
$10,000 damages for alleged injuries
received by the plaintiff in a motor
car accident which occurred near
Homer September 13, 1916, in which
she is said to have been severely in
jured. In her petition Miss Myers
stated that she was riding in a mo
tor car with Charles M. Henderson,
of Omaha, and that their motor was
overturned because of a defective
culvert. The car in which she was
riding met another machine and
Henderson, who was driving, turned
out slightly to one side to permit the
other machine to pass. In doing so
his machine struck a hole which was
hidden bvweeds.therjetition alleered
After tle accident, Miss Myers was
taken to the uerman L,utlieran hos
pital in Sioux City, where she re
mained for two weeks. Her left
arm was broken and she suffered
numerous cuts about the body and
legs from being thrown through the
wind shield of the car. For several
minutes after the accident she was
unconscious. Thursday afternoon
Miss Myers returned to the German
Lutheran hospital for further treat
ment. Emerson Enterprise, (Dem.): A.
M. Chambers, republican candidate
for state reprssentative from Thurs
ton and Dakota counties, was in Em
erson last Friday. Mr. Chambers is
the present incumbent of the oflice
and aspires to re-election. His rec
ord is well spoken of by those who
know his work in the last legislature.
... .In an effort to pick a man to fill
the senatorial chair left vacant by
Senator Shumway, this district could
make no happier choice than to pick
Frank F. Haase. He fills require

voter in all parties. If elected he
will be able to fill his duties untram

Sioux City Journal, 2nd: Edward
Novak, about 28 years old, farm em
ploye, yesterday morning was at
tacked on a road near Emerson,
Neb., and his head so badly beaten
that he was brought to St. Joseph's
hospital for treatment. Late last
night he was in a critical condition.
Novak, who worked for a farmer
living a short distance from Emer
son, set out from the farm yester
day morning to walk to Emerson.
He was within one and one-half
miles of the town at 1) o'clock, when
he was set upon by two thugs, who
beat him into insensibility. Then
they rifled his pockets, taking a
small amount of money. The injur
ed man was found in the road and
brought to Sioux City. The attend
ing physician last night had not de
termined whether the skull had been
fractured. The sheriff of Dixon
county yesterday searched for the
assailants of Novak and sent out
notices of the attack to police in
other towns ...A note found pinned
to the railing on the Combination
bridge yesterday by A. W. Crumball,
of South Sioux City, Neb., led the
police to believe that W. II. Morey,
40 years old, a farmer living near
balix, la., had taken his life by
plunging into the Missouri river.
The note read: "W. H. Morey, of
Salix, la., drowned himself. It is
with the deepest regret that I took
this step to put myself out of the
way. I was driven to it by my wife.
Mae Morey. I dearly' loved her and
1 hope and pray that every time she
looks upon the waters of the Missou
ri river she will see my blue eyes
reflected in every wave and ripple.
This is the best step for me and I
will be gone soon from this world.
Signed, W. H. Morey." The Sioux
City police investigated the Morey
note. Capt. Piatt Ford communi
cated with Mrs. George Morey,
mother of W. H. Morey, who lives
near Salix, and she informed him
that she knew all about the affair
but refused to add anything to the
information had by the police.

College of Agriculture.
CORN READY FOR SELECTION
Corn in most parts of the state is
in good condition for seed selection,
according to members of the Exten
sion Service of the college of agri
culture. Since corn is about normal this
year, there is little cause for worry
in the seed situation, tho careful se
lection always pays dividends. The
man who selects in the crib
often takes thelargest ears and usu
ally gets later corn by doing this.
Selection in the field enables him to
choose on the basis of earl v maturity.
Also, reliable seed permits him to
plant exactly the amount necessary
to get a desired stand, and there is
no likelihood of getting the c6rn too
thick or too thin by guessing how
much seed will germinate.
Probably the moat convoniontway
tlml out next November 1"
to gather seed is to do it while husk
ing early feed for hogs, a common
practice on many farms. A box may
be put on the side of the wagon, and
seed ears placed in this ns they are
found. Immediate drying is neces
sary for corn thus.selected.
Early selection and caroful dry
ing often make the ear test unneces
sary. Preliminary tests usually
show such corn to be uniformly
good.
"WHITEWASH FOR POULTRY HOUSE
A whitewash that disinfects, kills
mites, and brightens the poultry
house, recommended by the agricul
tural college poultry department, is
made as follows: Slack 5 quarts of
rocK nme with not water to auout
the consistency of cream. To this
add 1 pint ot crude carbolic acid or
zenoleum, and 1 quart of kerosene
Stir thoroly, and dilute with twice
its own volume ot water. Apply
with either spray pump or white
wash brush. When properly pre
pared, tin's solution accomplishes
three things: First, the zenoleum
acts as a disinfectant, killing germs.
Second, the kerosene penetrates the
wood and remains intact for some
time, and is effective in destroying
mites. Third, the lime is whitening
and brings an atmosphere of sweet
ness and light to the house.
HANDLING NEWLY-PURCHASED IJUMS
Stockmen who purchase and ship
Iambs to their farms for fall feeding
not infrequently suffer heavy loss
after shipment, loss that is at least
partially due to sudden change of
feed, savs the animal husbandry sec
tion of the Nebraska Experiment
Station.
It is well to allow the lambs plenty
of blue grass. If they are to be
turned into a corn field, they should
have their appetites curbed before
turning them into the held each day,
at the start. It would" be well to
have a grass pasture available and
also have alfalfa in racks. A little
alfalfa hay where western lambs can
have access to it at all times is a
splendid and economical means of
starting them on their winter feed.
BALANCED RATION FOR CHICKENS
A single grain ration, such as corn,
when fed to chickens cause a partial
starving thru lack of certain food
elements necessary to proper growth
in chicks and to the development of
yolk and albumen for the laying hen,
says the poultry department of the
agricultural college. N A general
weakness is noticeable where a va
riety of feed is not given. This
weakness sometimes manifests itself
in intestinal trouble and in a lower
ing of the vitality. Such feed as
corn when given alone is too fatten
ing; and unless a variety of at least
three grains is provided for in the
daily rations, best results in egg
production cannot be obtained.
SELECTING POTATOES FUMIGATING
The time spent in selecting seed
potatoes will be paid for several
times over in increased yields next
year, says the agricultural botany
department of the college of agri
culture.
Before the potato crop is stored,
it is wise to fumigate the potato
cellar to check the development of
dry rot during the winter. The seed
potatoes may also be sprayed with
some fungicide as Bordeau mixture
or lime-sulphur.
Seed potatoes should be kept sep
arate from the rest of tho crop, and
should be examined once or twice in
winter to see that no serious rot
ting develops.

Wlnchin Democrats Trylnn to Run
Away From tho Record of tho Ad

Voters Down Rhetorical By-Paths',
All In the ThInly.Dlsauised Effort
to r i'ge tho Subject.
Wh a :ir. Hughes criticises the rec
ord of tho Administration the spokes
men of Mr. Wilson cry: "What would
:,ou have, done?" They forget that It
Is Mr. Wilson and not Mr. Hughes
who Is on trial. They forget that
four years ago Mr. Wilson criticised
Mr. Taft and Mr. Itoosevelt through
out tho campaign and that Mr. Taft
and Mr. Itoosevelt defended their re
spective records, Instead of crying
"What would yoij have done?" The;
forget these tnlngs or they refuse to
confess them. They are trying to run

change the subject.
"By their fruits ye Minll know
them." When Mr. Hughes was Gov
ernor of New York ho did not pay
political debts by filling the public
olllees wllh unlit men. He did not
champion ceitaln principles during his
campaign and repudlnte them after
he entered olllce. As Governor, ho
did not resort to bravo and beautiful
words as a substitute for linn and con
sistent deeds. He was careful in bis
use of words but ho backed bis words
with deeds, llo did not promise what
he could nof. perform. Ho did not
plaster tho people with compllmtnts
they did not deserve. Ho was not n
rhetorician, he was not a flatterer, ho
was not "too proud to light" for labor
or for capital, for the strong or tho
weak, when the right was on their
side.
Mr. Wilson's spokesmen seek to di

Hughes Is making upon tho record of
