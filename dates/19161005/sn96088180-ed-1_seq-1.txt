RUSSIA HAS NO THOUGHT OF THE
DESERTION OF THE ALLIED NATIONS
The Hague, Sept 18 (By Mall).
Despite official denials that Russia
and Germany ' recently discussed a
separate peace, I have learned from
recent visits to Warsaw, Copenhagen
and The Hague that aome sort or a
conference did take place.
At, present, however, there la little
prospect that Russia will desert the
allies, Roumanla's Intervention In
the war has changed the situation
entirely from the csar's standpoint.
The report that a pence meeting
was held at Kovno was published re

CATTLE KILLING IN
Officers have lately been Investi
gating reports of the killing ot cattle
in the Murphy district. It la reported
that seven or eight head of cattle
have been found In the forests along
Murphy creek shot to death, and In
varying stages of decomposition, evi
dence that they had been killed at
different times. At least two head of
cattle haa found their way to their
home places mortally wounded, whne
some of those killed and left In the
woods have had their ears cnt off ao
that their ownership could not be
traced by the ear marks. Among
those whose cattle hare been Iden
tified among the killed are J. E. Swln-
den, of the 'Applegate valley above
Murphy, and Fred Lichens, of Pro-
volt
Some of thoae who have Investi
gated state that there la evidence
that tbe dead cattle have been haul
ed out Into the woods after being
killed, and the theory la advanced
that the animals may have been shot
when trespassing npon lands and
Lthen disposed of by being hauled out
Into the "brush. County Attorney
Miller haa made an Investigation, bnt
states that he has not yet obtained
evidence to connect anyone with the
killing of the two animals whose car
