SOFIA, Oct 5.—Bulgarian troops
jure enveloped and destroyed fifteen
or sixteen Romanian batalllons (about
15,000 men) which crossed the Dan
ube and invaded Bulgaria near Ria
hovo, said an official statement from
the war office today.
The defeat suffered by the Ruman
ians Is the greatest since the destruc
tion of the Rumanian army at the
fortress of Tutrakan, when 23,000 Ru
manians were trapped and captured
south of the Danube.

afternoon announced- that, the Ruman

If the Bulgarian statement is frue,
the Rumanians have suffered two most
severe defeats on the Danube in the
five weeks since they entered the war.
When German and Bulgarian forces
captured the Rumanian fortress of Tut
rakan, the Rumanian garrison was
surrounded on the south bank and
captured. Several hundred Ruman

while attempting to swim the stream.]

THE HAGUE, Sept. 16. (by mail)—
Despite official denials that Russia
and Germany recently discussed a
separate peace, I have learned from
recent visits to "Warsaw, Copenhagen
and The Hague that some sort of a
conference did take place.
At present, however, there is little
prospect that Russia will desert the
allies. Rumania's intervention in the
war has changed the situation entire
ly from the czar's standpoint. The
report that a peace meeting was held
at Kovno was published recently in
the Nleuwe Courant one of the best
informed newspapers of Holland. The
Courant article has not been pub
lished in any belligerent country. It
is understood here, though it created
a sensation in Holland and the neu
tral Scandinavian countries.
Immediately following its publica
tion the Russian legation here Issued
8i«iB*»
|,
~*enhfl -was -tele-'
grapbe0 from Berllo but regardless
of this fact officials in Scandinavian
countries believe a great deal of the
Courant article Is true.
The Courant asserted that speoial
representatives of the ccar and Pre
mier Stunner met the kaiser and
Field Marshal Von Hindenburg at
Kovno in August. exactly what
caused the negotiations to be broken
off was not learned. One report was
that Russia learned that* Rumania
was about t6 enter the war. Another
report was that Emperor Franz Josef
had refused to cede Galicia and Buko
wlna to Russia, the price demanded
by the czar for ft separate peace.
Russia was said to be willing to
make a separate peace because she
was afraid of Japanese aggression in
China, because General Brusilofrs of
fnslve had failed to capture L.
em berg
and Kovel and because the allies had
not. given her successful co-opera
tions on other fronts. Germany, ac
cording to a neutral in The Hague,
was willing to see that Turkey made
some concessions to Russia regarding'
the Dardanelles. Poland was to be
made a kingdom with a slice of Ga
licia- added, .under Prince Leopold of
Bavaria.
Demand for Diamonds.

NEW YORK, Oct. 5—Though the
cost of living goes higher, the demand
for diamonds—due largely to war
bride profits—is on the increase, said

Three Aged Mfi^re Missing and Believed to Have Lost

[United Press Leased Wire Service]
5.-^JBrother Carmack, 92, and Brother Clement, 78, and an aged
attendant are missing and believed dead in the fire that destroyed the Christian Brothers
college here today.
The fire, which started at 7:30, spread rapidly and in loss than an hour had almost
completely destroyed the institution, which wias one of the oldest Catholic schools in the
United States.
A few minutes before noon one of the walls of the college building collapsed, burying
about ten firemen. Two were taken from the ruins immediately. They are dying.
|H Brothers Carmack and Clement, among the oldest brothers in the order, were on there
tired list and lived in what is known as the infirmary'on the fifth floor. The infirmary was
cut off almost immediately following the outbreak of the fire.
The attendant also was on the fifth floor at the time the blaze was discovered. The
fact that the death toll was light, was due to a rule which compelled students to leave their
beds before six o'clock. The brothers and employes of the institution are generally up at
Eye. The college houses between two and three hundred students, tutors and attendants.
The destruction of the college probably means the abandonment of the institution of
the order in St. Louis. .. v"".-*

OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 5.—President
Wilson came to Omaha today to greet
150,000 people who thronged into Ne
braska's metropolis to see him. Dur
ing his stay here he planned to make
three speeches one at the Commer
cial cluh. luncheon, another at a din
ner tonight and the third at the
Auditorium at eight o'clock.
By his political managers, the
president's addresses today are re
garded as the big volley to protect the
central west against capture by
Charles E. Hughe$. Local party lieu
tenants said, however, that Nebraska
is already strongly In line with fifteen
or twenty thousand votes to spare.
The president was in great fettle to
day after further enthusiastic recep
tions enroute through Iowa this morn
ing. At Council

there was a big
crowd with a singular number of old
people. One elderly gentleman, reach

"Let me shake hands with a Lin

An old lady greeted him:
"God bless you, my dear."
Omaha was in holiday array to greet
the executive. Thousands of people
drawn into the city by the lures of the
annual Ak-Sar-Ben festival, thronged
the streets and cheered the president
on his every appearance.
Following the luncheon at the
Commercial club the president was to
ride in and later interview the great
pageant held under the auspices ot
the Nebraska Historical society and
the Ak-Sar-Ben. The pageant abound
ed in gorgeous floats, and was featur
ed by a whole tribe of Indians and
scores of cowpunchers, fresh from Ne

Every available spot for sitting and
standing along the line of march was
occupied long before the president
took his place at the head of the pro
cession.

It was stated today at the board of
