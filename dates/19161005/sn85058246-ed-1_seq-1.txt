Well-Bred Girl.
' The other day we saw n young girl,
seventeen or eighteen perhaps, listen

father told n story sho hud henrd often.
One sees so much Inattention unil
smirking deprecation of father's or
mother's hobbles that It was n pleas
ant thing. We credit that Httlo lady
with lur moro than meie good train
ingwith the right kind of heart. For
truly good manners mean more than
technlc; they bespeak tho truo man
nnd tho truo woman, too. Exchange.

ought to be of tho Hughes lypo. tie
would let light into all the dark am!

Ho would destroy tho alliance be

The local boys nro rapidly round

Tho probable loss of Bennlon nnd
tho loss of Church, tacklo of last year
who hnd to leavn school to look aft
er his farming Interests, will hit tho
team rather hnrd. However the spir
it with which the bojs nro working
and tho abuudauco of good material

Aggies will havo a scrappy, well bal
anced team..
Tho West Sldo High School has
most of Its old men back. They nro

From nil Indications Saturday's gamo

J HOW ABOUUOWER TAXES ?
Tho local Democrats aro having n hard tlmo just now to Justify
their statements mado In county convention that tho taxes In Cacho
county had been lowered by the present commissioners. There Is
nt leust ono candidate on tho Democratic ticket who says, In vlow
of tho fact that the tax notices hnvo recently been mailed out,
that ho wlshos theso notices could have been hold until after tho
election. Ho is fearful that tho pcoplo will detect tho wldo dls
creponcy between tho statements and tho actual fncts.
Mr. Taxpayer, in all ratrness, havo you ovor seen your taxes as
high as thoy are this year? Look at your tax notlcos ond comparo
them with provlous years. It you llnd your tnxos lower, Just put
It down that you aro nmong tho favored fow, and It scorns that wo
have tho "favored fow," in tills administration, when comparisons

Got down to real facts, Mr. Taxpayer, when your Democratic
neighbor begins to toll you of the economical administration which
has jheon given this county. Cnst about and seo If yon have any
thing that would Justify such an Increaso In your taxes.
