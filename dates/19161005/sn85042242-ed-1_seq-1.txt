FOLEY TO TELL
STORY OF 1.0.
Inside Facts of Romantic Ven­
ture of Marquis De

AUTHOR WELL VERSED
IN EARLY HISTORY
State Again To Embark in Pack­
ing Industry After Long
Years
(Editor's Note.—This is the
first of a series of articles by J.
W. Foley of Medora on North Da­
kota's first packing plant venture.
Mr. Foley for years was confiden­
tial agent for Marquis De Mores
and for the first time has consent­
ed to tell the story of that inter
esting venture. He has access to
all papers and other data. These
articles will appear exclusively in
The Tribune.)
BY J. W. FOLEY.
Medora, Oct. 4.—Thirty-three years
have gone by since the first abattoir
in which beef was slaughtered for the
retail trade was opened in what is
now the State of North Dakota. Had
this business been started by an Amer­
ican, little notice would have been
taken by the people at large. Its
success or failure might have caused
a "nine day wonder" and then have
been forgotten. But fortunately for
the Ten Cent Magazine wiiters it was
started by a French R'.nrquis and this
fact gave these waters the chance of
their lives.
'Perennial Sensation.
When sensations were lacking there
was always De Mores and his packing
plant to fall bask upon. There were
as many roths written about the oil

knowledge. We have oft«u been an*
ed to do'thitf» but as our old friend
TutMe used U/ Vfty: "The time was
not considered ripe." Now that thir­
ty years have passed since the plant
was closed for the last time we feel
that its history may be written. We
are perhaps the only one now living
who can write its true history, hav­
ing been with the business from al­
most its start and having had ac­
cess to all the records, accounts and
correspondence. It's true, persons
who never had the inside information
claim to know more of the business
than we do, and have told us so. To
such we can only Bay in all kindness,
"It's possible you may have been mis­
informed."
The First Abattoir.
We will here say that the articles
are written as a little history of the
past that dear old past which is
gone never to return, and with it
many of the dear old pioneers. The
articles are not inspired by the news
that other abattoirs are to be erected
in our state or to encourage or dis­
courage their erection. Medora had
the first abattoir. This is sufficient
honor. Times then and now are vast­
ly different. North Dakota had then
Scarcely 150,000 Inhabitants. What
has it today? There was one trans­
continental railroad. Today there are
four. There was one bank in all the
west Missouri country. How many
today? There were two markets in
which fresh meat was sold. How many
today?
Now for a little personal history:
We went into the service of De Mores
in St. Paul in 1884, and in New York
fn 1886. All the business was placed
in our hands in November 18S6, when
if was in operation from Helena to
New York. When we reported for
duty at St. Paul, the news that we
had been in the army had reached
there, and it was fully understood that
we knew nothing of business nor of
anything else. We were told so, and
to this day we are not fully satisfied,
but the ones who had formed the

NEW COINS FEATURING SYMBOLS OF PEACE SOON WILL
FLOOD NATION
By F. M. KERBY.
Washington, Oct. .—-New coins for
old" will be the slogan of. the treas­
ury department and its mint service
within a few weeks, when the new
design of dimes will be ready for
issuance.
Following the dimes will come the
new quarter and half dollar pieces.
The new dime will have on one
side a head of Liberty with a winged
cap. The reverse side shows a de­
sign of a bundle of rods, with a bat­
tle-axe, known as "Faces," and sym­
bolical of unity. Surrounding the
faces is a full foliaged branch of
olive, symbolical of peace.
The half dollar bears a full length
figure of Liberty, the folds of the
Stars and Stripes flying in the back­
ground. The figure is striding to­
ward the dawn of a new day, carry­
ing branches of laurel and oak, sym­
bolical of civil and military glory.
The reverse of the half dollar
shows an eagle, perched high on a
mountain crag, with wings unfolded.
From a rift in the rock is springing
a sapling of mountain pine, symbol­
ical of America.
The 25-cent piece contains a full
length figure of Liberty, front view,
with head Aligned to the left, stepping
forward tpthe gateway of the coun­
try. On the wall is inscribed, "In
God v.e Trust," which appears also
on the new half dollar. The left arm
of Liberty is upraised, bearing the
shield in the attitude of protection.
The right hand bears the olive branch
of peace. The word, "Liberty," ap­
pears above.
On the reverse side is shown the
American eagle in full flight with
wings extended, and the inscription,
Jnited States of America," and "E
Pluribus Unum," and "Quarter Dol­
lar" below. Connecting the letter
above on the outer circle are olive
branches with ribbon that is stirred
by the breeze as the bird flies.
By law, the coins are required to
have the figure of Liberty and the
American eagle. It is in the design­
ing of the figures that the changes
have been made.

FRENCH CUP
Edward Kosmal, German Soldier,
Survives Many Gruelling
Experiences
Baltimore, Mr., Oct. 4.—After
spending a year in a French prison
camp stowing away on the Norwegian
steamer* Slf, and spending eight days
with chocolate and water as his only
nourishment, Edward Kosmol, a Ger­
man soldier, was taken before Immi­
gration Commissioner Stump, when
the steamer arrived today, and held
pending a decision on his case.
Kosmol told how on July 22, 1915,
he was a member of the 51st Silesian
Infantry, crushed by the French at. a
battle near Arras, in France, with
3,000 other Germans, he was taken
to Havre and placed in the prison
pens. Later he was one of hundreds
marched daily to the great quays of
that port to help discharge steamers
that brought food and ammuniion for
the Allies.
Asked how the German prisoners
were received by the French, he said
the middle classes were very thought­
ful of them when they passed through
the streets to and from the intern­
ment camps, but the lower classes
hooted and were very ugly.

Bucharest is still silent with regard

"Sweden proclaimed her attitude of
