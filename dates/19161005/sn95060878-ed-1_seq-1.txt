' TUCSON, Oct. 6 Russell
T. Johnson, who was charged
with murder in the second de
gree, growing out of the kill
ing of Eugene Caruthers at
Gila Bend on September 21,
was discharged at a hearing
before Justice of the Peace
DeSouza at Phoenix Wed
nesday. Johnson was repre
sented by Judge John H.
Campbell of Tucson, with
whom was associated Alexan
der and Christy of Phoenix.
John B. Ryland, president of the Gila
Land & Cattle Company, of which
Johnson is manager, attended the
hearing. Judge Campbell and Mr. Ry
laiyl returned to Tucson this morning.
The nine witnesses examined by
both sides told practically the same
story. All agreed that Caruthers sent
word to Johnson that he wanted to
see him in his store. Johnson, who
was in an automobile in front of the
store, went into the store in response
to Caruthers' request and, upon en-
' tering the store, was attacked by Car
uthers. Johnson retreated to the auto
mobile, being followed by Caruthers
who drew his gun and threatened to
kill him. Johnson told him that there
was no occasion for trouble and tliat
they could settle their difficulties
peaceably. Caruthers replied with an
oath and said that he intended to have
trouble right then. He walked around
the automobile and attempted to take
Johnson out of the machine. Johnson
then moved to the other side of the
car, which was a Ford truck. Caruthers
then climbed over the back of the
car to the right-hand side, grabbed the
top support with his left hand and
pulled his gun down on Johnson with
his right hand. It was then that John
son fired, shooting him through the
heart. Caruthers fell back on the
ground. Caruthers gun, a .32 auto
matic, had the safety off and was fully
loaded with a cartridge in the barrel.
The court, after hearing this evi
dence, found that there was no prob
able cause for holding the defendant
to answer and by this decision com
pletely exonerated Johnson of all
blame.
VIOUTIHG THEIR HTRALHY
The value of political par
ties organized on the Ameri
can plan is being put to a se
vere examination this fall.
Of course, there will be par
ties wherever there are differ
ences of opinion. The ques
tion is whether the American
type of party has not tended
to shift the emphasis from
opinions to organization, so
that we now have two great
parties whose differences of
opinion are not sufficient to
excuse their existence, and
which do not in fact represent
the great split in opinion
; which cuts across the coun
try. I Whatever life has been injected into
the present campaign, aside from the
vivacity which comes from a passion
ate desire to hold offices and share
spoils, has been almost all accidental
and unexpected. It was an accident
which placed Woodrow Wilson in the
chair during the European war, and
thus made his party a defender of the
new neutral policies; it was an acci
dent which consigned Mexico to Mr.
Wilson's supervision; it was an acci
dent which placed the railroad strike
before him for settlement.
The traditional policies of the great
parties were remotely, but not direct
ly, connected with those adopted by
Mr. Wilson in these emergencies. In
the settlement of the railroad wage
dispute Mr. Wilson fairly turned his
back on the principles of his party
and countenanced an extension of the
federal power, which is entirely incon-
The request made by the
lexican commissioners at
the New London conference
that the United States enter
into an agreement to make
things unpleasant for such
Americans as violate neutral
ity by engaging in conspira
cies against the peace of Mex
ico is eminently reasonable.
In fact, it is so reasonable that
all the United States would
be obliged to do would be to
enforce its existing statutes
on the subject.
There is not the slightest douht
that ever since the beginning of the
revolt led by Francisco I. Madero
against Diaz, many violations of Mexi
can neutrality have taken place in the
United States. It is likely, also, that
if they had been directed against a
stronger power than Mexico, the
United States would have been called
upon to explain them, and possibly
to foot a large bill on account of
them.
It is weft known that: during the
Madero revolution recruits were open
ly enlisted in the United States. It
was done right here in Yuma
These recruits were marched down to
