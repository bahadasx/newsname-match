BIG TIMBER SALE
IS CONSUMMATED
PALMER BUYS 330,000,000 FEET
Tract in National Forest Company b
Formed to Begin Operation Early
Next Year
John W. Palmer, owner of a large
West Side orchard tract, who several
years ago retired from the presidency
of the Westport Lumber Co., which
operated a mill on the lower Columbia,
announced Saturday afternoon that he
had been awarded by the United States
Forestry Department the purchase of
apptoximately 330.00C.00O feet of tim
ber, chiefly Douglaa fir, in the Oregon
National Forest on the Upper West
Fork of Hood River in the southwest
ern part of this county. The deal just
consummated comprises the largest
sale of Douglas fir evef made by the
Forestry Department, and the mill
contemplated to cut the area will have
a daily capacity of 200,000 feet, consid
erably larger than any ever formerly
operated in the Mid-Columbia region.
The timber purchased covers a total
area of 7,340 acres. The task of sell
ing it has dragged out for more than a
year. Following an announcement of
the probable sale last summer a letter
was received by the Forestry depart
ment from local interests expressing
the fear that the denudation of the
area would result in freshets on the
Hood River in the early spring and
cause a drought during the season of
irrigation of orchards. These fears
were dissipated following meetings be
tween local citizens and representa
tives of the Forestry Department, who
explained that the area included formed
but little more than a third of the
West Fork water shed and that in fact
that the West Fork waa fed principally
in the summer months by the glaciers
of Mount Hood. The forestry men
expressed the opinion that reforesta
tion will have taken place on the areas
first cut over before the last of the
timber is logged. The meeting re
sulted in a resolution, unanimously
endorsed by the Hood River Commer
cial Club and business men, approving
the sale. It will probably take 12
years to cut the fir.
News of the purchase of the timber,
the total sale price of which will reach
an approximate $350,000, has been re
ceived with rejoicing by local men, for
the consumation of the deal will un
doubtedly lead to the construction of a
wagon and automobile road to Lost
Lake. Ten per cent of the funds re
ceived for the sale of timber will go to
the state for the construction of roads
or trails in National forests in any
part of the state. Twenty five per
cent will be apportioned between
Wasco, Hood River and Clackamas
counties, within the borders of which
the national forest containing the tim
ber la located. On former visits here
T. H. Sherrard, atate forest supervis
or, stated that the sale of the timber
would make available funds for con
struction of the Lost Lake road.
Mr. Palmer stated that a company,
to be known as the West Fork Lumber
Co., has been incorporated to handle
the timber. Other incorporators are
J. F. Palmer and .Henry Carstens, the
latter a capitalist and member of the
firm of Carstens & Earle, of Seattle,
who have invested heavily in the bonds
of bonded irrigation districts of this
county. Mr. Palmer, before coming
here, waa engaged in the lumber busi
ness in Mississippi, Minnesota and
western Washington. He has had a 25
years experience as a lumberman.
The Oregon Lumber Co., which has
already pushed its logging roads with
in a few miles of the government tim
ber, in order to tap its own holdings in
the district, will begin at once to ex
tend its line to the Base Line, which
forms the north boundary of the area
involved in the sale. As early as work
may be commenced next spring, the
West Fork Lumber Co., will connect
up with the logging road already con
structed and extend a line to tap its
timber.
"We want to express our apprecia
tion," said Mr. Palmer, "of the aid we
received from the Commercial Club
and the Hood River business men in
the consummation of the deal. While
the deal has been a long time hanging
fire, now that it is definitely settled,
we are going to push our work as fast
as possible. We hope -and think that
the benefits from the deal will be
mutual for us and for - the general
Hood River public.
"We have not yet decided on the
exact location or our plant nor its
definite size. If the lumber market
conditions of next year are right, how
ever, a mill of 200,000 feet daily
capacity will be constructed as quickly
as we can get the material on the
ground."
ANNALS OF THE
PIONEER ASSOCIATION
(Read by Mrs. T. R. Coon, historian,
at recent reunion)
As we meet today in our annual re
union and look for the familiar faces
of those we knew in former years, we
are gladdened by the sight of many old
time friends : but some are not here,
for the Reaper Death is never idle, and
since our last meeting be has gathered
the ripened sheaves and carried them
to the Better Land.
Lyman Smith, who met with us two
years ago, died at his home in Port
land on November 10, 1915. He passed
away on the 40tff anniversary of his
arrival in Hood River, at the age of 81
years. Without sickness or suffering
he fell asleep.
He came to Hood River in 1875 with
the Parkhurst colony, took up land
and built a home. Lyman Smith av

terminates at the farm borne. For
many years he operated a sawmill in
Hood River valley and literally aided
in building up the country.
Mrs. Smith died in 1895. They are
both buried in IdlewHde cemetery.
Sophia A. French waa born in Ver
mont in .May, 1819. In early woman
hood the waa married to Joshua L.
Weeks, of Lowell. Mass. In 1852 be
journeyed to California in search of
gold; for five years the wife toiled for
her children, hoping for bis return;
then cam the joyful newa that he waa
on bia way, having sailed from Aspin
wall on the (hip Central America.
Two days before the vessel wai due
in New York a hurricane swept over
the aea and abe aank with more tban
500 passengers. To the wife and
mother came years of aadness and un
remitting toil. The children grew to
maturity, the daughter married Pratt
Wbitcomb and moved to California, the
mother. and soon son followed. In this
new land Mrs. Weeks met and married
Jamea Hutton, who lived only a short
time, then ahe made her home with her
son who waa mining in Nevada. While
absent irom borne for a few daya he
was atriken with pneumonia and died.
The ahock :.f bia death caused partial
paralysis and an impediment in ber
speech, an afflction which always re
mained with her.
From Nevada she came to Portland.
and then to Hood River in 1877, buying
the Horn place. On this place ahe
lived and toiled for years, doing work
of every description regardless of her
advancing age. in 1891 she moved to
Portland to make her home with ber
duaghter, but waa always glad to meet
her Hood River friends and talk over
old times. Her closing daya were quiet
and peaceful. She retired as usual on
the evening of January 8. When her
daughter called her in the morning
there was no response, for death had
claimed her. She was buried in Riv
erview cemetery, Portland. Her age
waa 96 years and eigth months.
allies a. Potter came to Hood Kiver
with the Parkhurst colony in 1875. He
bought the Whitcomb farm and later
erected a handsome residence. He and
Mrs. Potter were charter members of
the Belmont Methodist church and ac
tive workers in that demonination. He
waa a veteran of the Civil war and
suffered greatly in health as a result
of the exposure endured while serving
his country. For several yeara his
home had been in Portland, where he
died January 7, 1916, aged 74 years.
Willis Graham Clelland came to Hood
River in the spring of 1882, taking a
homestead orr the East Side two and a
half miles from town, where he lived
for 12 years. He married Minnie Rand
in 1888. She waa a pioneer of 1884.
Mr. Clelland's death occurred at his
home in Portland, January 30, 1916,
and was caused by heart trouble. A
wife and two children survive him.
Mr. and Mrs. Benton Rand came to
Hood River in 1884 and located on the
east side of Hood river not far from
town. This waa their home for 25
years, when they moved away, their
last residence being Eugrne where
they Doth died, she passing away first.
Wm. bills came to Hood Kiver in
1890 and became identified with the
strawberry business. He was with us
at the last Pioneer meeting and was
the second oldest pioneer present, be
ing at that time 86 years old. He was
known as Grandpa bins and left eight
children, 24 grandchildren, 23 great
grandchildern and one - great-great
grandchild. He died March o, lsie.
D. A. Turner pays the following
tribute to one of our early pioneers :
I think it is due to the Pioneer Asso
ciation of Hood River to leave on rec
ord a Bhort history of one of the early
settlera of this valley that had a part
in the successful work that developed
the east side of the country. J refer
to Mr. Davia Divers, who came from
Clackamas county, Oregon, in the
spring of 1862 with his wife, Parthena
(nee Mitchell), and lour sons, jonn,
James, Joel and William. He settled
on Hood river near the place called
Summit, where three of the boys
afterward took up land. One of the
sons, James, was drowned in the Owy
hee river of eastern Oregon while on a
trip driving cattle. Mr. Divers waa a
good neighbor, very industrious and a
member of the Methodist church. Af
ter his boys left home and his wife
died, he sold his farm and lived a while
near the Odell school house. When be
became so feeble he could not live
alone he made his home with the Ned
brothers near his old home. He is
buried in the Butte cemetery near his
wife."
Thomas M. Ramsdell waa the first
of all the early pioneers to see this
valley. In November, 1844, wth three
other young men he drove the stock of
the Neal Gilliam party from the
Dalles to the Willamette valley. They
swam their stock across toe coiumDia
from the mouth of Hood river and
drove them down the north bank to
Vancouver. Mr. Ramsdell moved his
family to Hood River in 1862 and built
a house near Phelps creek and was,
perhaps, the first minister to locate
here. One of hia deeds, while here,
was to travel on snowshoes in the
month of March from his home to the
home of D. A. Turner where he per
formed the marriage ceremony for that
gentleman and Miss Amanda Neal.
Rev. Ramsdell died in Portland in Oc
tober, 1914, aged 94 years.
D. A. Turned has lived longer in
Hood River than any other person; F.
C. Sherrieb is next.
Amos Underwood was in Hood River
in September, 1852, but did not re
main. He afterwards homesteaded
Polala Illahe, now known as Ruthton.
Later he moved across the Columbia
and now lives in the town which bears
his name. He will be 82 in December
next.
The two families of Dr. Farnsworth
and Wm. Laugblin moved to Hood Riv
er in October 1852. In January the
Farnsworth family left in a canoe,
never to return. The Laughlin family
endured the hardships of a aevere win
ter, saw their stock starve to death,
and late in the spring of 1853 moved
back to The Dalles. The only surviv
ing member of the family ia B. F.
Lauehlin. of Portland.
In 1853 E. S. Joslyn and wife located
in White Salmon. They are both dead
and their farm ia now known as the
Byrkett place.
Of those who located here in 154 H.
C. Coe ia the only one alive.
The oldest living person born in
Hood River, aa far as 1 am able to
learn, is Frank Coe Benson, who lives
at 364 Ross St., Portland. He was
born in February 1860, and ia the aon
of Jamea and Margaret Benson, who
lived in the log cabin on Indian creek
James Benson bad lumber sent from
Portland, paying at the rata of $80 per
M., with which he made a dining table
for the family and a cradle for the
boy.
Mr. Cowperthwaite, who spent the
winter of '67 and '58 with A. C. Phelps
on Phelps ereek, is now living in cam
as, Ore. He ia 90 yeara of age and to
tally blind.
S. T. Howe, a pioneer of '82, is liv
ing in Greenville, Tex. He ia 81 yeara
of age and blind, but greatly enjoys
getting letters from Hood River
friends.
Our honor roll consists of those 70
yeara of age and upwards. If mistakes
are made it is unintentional. Wm.

APPLE PICKERS
NOW PLENTIFUL
HARVEST IS NOW LN FULL SWING
Government Opens Employment Agency
at Warehouse of Association Poor
Facilities for Caring for Help
Pickers began to arrive here from
neighboring cities in scores last week,
and C. B. Green, of the United Statea
Immigration Bureau, who has charee
of a government employment agency
at me omce ot the Apple growers
Association, says:
"At the beginning of the harvest of
Hood River apples, at least." savs Mr.
Green, "1 do not anticipate any short
age of men. When the harvest is at
its height, however, we mav not be
able to supply enough men."
Mr. Green saya that employment by
strong and able bodied women may be
secured in orchards as well as by men.
He advises that all seeking work here
bring with them tents, beddina and
other supplies, aa many growers are
not able to lurnish their harvest hands
with lodging. The government official
declares that this feature is one that
should be overcome by Hood River
orcbardists both for their strawberry
aa well as apple harvest. The inaug
uration of community packing houses,
however, where bunkhouse facilities
are usually provided as well as the
boarding of pickers, will be a great
aid to the situation.
A few harvest bands, coming here.
declare that the prices offered are not
sufficiently enticing and, it is said, are
leaving for other regions. According
to the recommendations of the Asso
ciation, local growers are paying 20
cents per hour or $2.00 per day for
general orchard work. Some growers,
however, fearful of a shortage, are
offering $2.25 per day while others will
pay by the box this season.
BENSON WILL PAVE
MILE OF HIGHWAY
The report circulated here the last
week to the effect that S. Benson had
changed his mind about the paving of
a mile of the Highway between Cas
cade Locks and the Mutlnomah county
line and that he was going to macad
amize the road the entire distance be
tween the two points instead, accord
ing to W. L. Cark, who returned home
last week after having made an inspec
tion of the road in the company of
Amos S. Benson, is absolutely erron
eous. Mr. Clark says that Mr. Benson
is going to follow out his original
plans.
"The younger Mr. Benson," says
Mr. Clark, "wonders how auch a state
ment could have been made, as no
change in their plans had ever oc
curred either to him or his father.
"The paving, identical with that of
the Multnomah end of the Highway,
will be 10 feet wide. ' It will be so
constructed that the additional four
feet to be added to the sides, making
the width 18 feet aa in case of the
Multnomah county portion, can be con
structed without a change in the
crown. The new road work is well
started. The grading is a third done
and some of the paving has been laid.
The men having the contract are doing
a fine job. If the weather remains
good the work Bhould be completed in
the next twe weeks.
Mr. Clark, however, thinks that this
county should take some measures
toward grading the ditches to the side
and of preparing drainage for tl.e road.
"Mr. Benson's gift does not include
this portion of the road work," says
Mr. Clark. "He is paving the stretch
because it would probably be impass
able soon if not paved. It gets awful
ly wet here in the winter months, and
unless Hood River takes some action
toward drainage, we are liable to Iobb
the paving before next spring."
C. F. SEELEY HERE
TO INSPECT PROPERTY
Despite the fact that he himself is a
supporter of the Wilson administration
and saya that he ia on the fence and
may vote for Wilson, C. Ford Seeley, a
capitalist of Baltimore, Md., who ar
rived here Tuesday night te look after
orchard interests, brings the message
that Baltimore sentiment is strongly in
favor of Justice Hughes.
"If expression of the men I meet in
my daily life in Baltimore counts for
anything," says Mr. Seeley, "then
Hughes will carry by a large vote the,
business element of that city. It looks
as though Hughes would get the ma
jority of the support of the city."
Mr. Seeley, who already owns 54
acrea of local orchards, which will
come into bearing this season, says
that he hopes to purchase an additional
50 acres before returning borne:
