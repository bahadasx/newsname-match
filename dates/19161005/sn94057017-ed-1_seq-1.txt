The M. E. conference at El
Paso assigned to Estancia Rev.
J. A. Bretz. R. E. Farley was
returned to the Mountainair and
Willard charge, C. O Beckman
to Albuquerque, and Rev. S.
Alonzo Bright was retained as
superintendent.
The first issue of the Moun
tainair Independent was issued
last week. It is published bv
the "Mountainair Printing Co.,"
and edited by P. A. Speckmann.
It is full of news, well edited,
and if the people of that part of
the county will give it the neces
sary support they can bank on
having a good paper.
Mr. Afton, Denver sales man
ager for the Ford automobiles,
was here the first of the week,
and arranged to make Estancia a
distributing point, with J. C.
Peterson in charge. Branches
will be established at Mountain
air, Willard, Encino, Vaughn,
Corona, and probably at a num
ber of other points in the terri
tory. There also seems little
doubt that a good building will
be erected in Estancia in the
near future.
John Block has made plans to
start today for Palomas Springs,
to see if the baths will relieve
him of rheumatism.

spector who was shot in the bat

Romero grocery stock and is in
posession. Mr. Romero will re
tain the other part of the stock
in the same building for a month,
and will then move it to his com
missary at the mill in the moun
tains. His lumber business re
quires his personal attention, and
that is why he wanted to get the
store off his hands. Mr. Meador
is familiar with the mercantile
business and no doubt will make
a success of it.
The Holiness meetings con
ducted by Rev. Threadgill at the
M, E. church, closed Sunday
night with ten or twelve conver
sions, and no doubt there was a
revival of religious feeling in the
case of many professors. Mr.
Threadgill was much liked and
made many friends here. He
was ably assisted by the Douglas
band. The entire party went
from here to Monarty, Mr.
Threadgill to attend the Holiness
Association and the others to
take up their duties as teachers
in the Holiness school.
TORRANCE
IS FIRST
Mrs. Buchanan writes from El
Paso saying that she wishes to
sincerely thank the friends who
have been so good to her during
her residence in Estancia. She
seems to feel that the move has
been a good one says they are
all in good health, the baby hav
ing gained in that respect. Lau
rence has employment as messen
ger for the E. P. S. W. railroad
company at $25 per month for
two months, and a raise there
after, and stands, next for caller
at $60 per month.
On Sunday, September 24th,
Mr. and Mrs. Wra. Winkel of
Encino had an automobile acci
dent near Lucy. Their car
turned clear over. Both were
considerably bruised, but Mrs.
Winkel got the worst of it. For
a time it was feared that she had
been seriously injured internally,
but happily it proved otherwise.
Mr. and Mrs. Winkel were in
Estancia yesterday and seemed
none the worse for their ex
perience. A son of Nicolas Baca who had
been ill several days, but who
seemed to have practically re
covered, last Saturday suddenly
took a turn for the worse and de
veloped a typical case of diph
theria. Anti-toxin was immedi
ately administered and the pa
tient is reported progressing
favorably. Strict quarantine
was established, even to the ex
tent of keeping the children
from that neighborhood out of
school this week, and it is be
lieved that no other cases will
develop.
No doubt you have noticed
that Torrance county walked off
with first premium for dry farm
exhibit at the state fair last
week. If you will think about
it, you will realize that this is
quite a bit of glory. And if you
will think about it a little fur
ther, you will realize that with
out a county agent we wouldn't
have got it. We would have had
the stuff, of course, but it would
not have been collected, properly!
prepared and taken to Albuquer
que, and properly displayed there.
In the first place, only a few
men know prize winning stuff
when they see it, and those men,
aside from Mr. Harwell, are
very busy with their private af
fairs and cannot afford to donate
several weeks of their time for
the public benefit. Mr. Harwell
is a public servant, therefore
this is his business, and right
well has he done it Fortunate
ly for us. he is not only thorough
ly competent, but energetic and
conscientious in the discharge of
his duties, and he has the pa
tience and tact to get around the
numerous difficulties that con
front him.
Once more Torrance county has
won first premium at the state
fair for county exhibit of non-
írngated products.
ihe county scored 829 points.
Lincoln county was second
with 635 points.
there was ottered Drevious to
the opening of the fair $200 as
first premium in this class. After
the opening of the fair the man
agement proposed to withdraw
this that is, they proposed to
make no distinction between ir
rigated and non-irrisrated pro
ducts. This was so plainly unjust
that the non-irrigated counties
would have withdrawn from the
competition, They had been in
duced to spend their money in
collecting and taking exhibits to
the fair by the offer of $200 as a
first premium. Finally the man
agement decided to pay $150 as a
first premium and $100 second.
Ihe winning of first premium
in this competition this year is a
victory well worth talking about,
and will again call attention to
the fact that Torrance county
should get more credit than has
been given it in many quarters.
It gives the county some ad
vertising of the hiarhlv desirable
kind, and should call the atten
tion of many outside people to its
merits.
and a credit to their nation which
stands behind the work.
State winners as yec cannot be
announced since records and
stories must be gone over at the
Agricultural College.
Political Announcement
We are authorized to announce
that T. L. Capt will be a candi
date before the Democratic coun
ty convention for the office of
sheriff of Torrance county.
Card of Thanks
We desire to thank the friends
and neighbors for their kindness
and assistance in our recent be
reavement in the death of our
daughter, Mrs. Linnie E, Deal.

NOTICE.
The Torrance county section of
the Boys' and Girls' (Jlub camp
at the state fair seemed to get
more than their share of enjoy
ment. At almost any hour of
the day the childeren could be
found talking and laughing while
taking in the fair's activities
from in front of a booth, sitting
in the grand stand, or witness
ing the performance of some
street fakir. The whole week
passed without incident to mar
the pleasure of a single individ
ual. Captain Toulouse together
with the whole Extension force
set about to do everything possi
ble that would add one little ele
ment of pleasure for the children.
All privileges of the fair were
open to the wearers of the club
work insignia, grand stand and
all. They were taken repeated
ly to picture shows and other
down town pleasures by those in
charge of the camp.
Our reputation as a county
was one of order and happiness.
Miss Annie Porter forever gained
the respect and love of the
children by -her kindness and
consideration. Other delegations
were more than glad to have op
portunity of being placed under
her care. Mr. Burt made a de
cided hit and was on the job
every minute seeing that all
went well and that the children
enjoyed themselves. The Coun
ty Agent looked after the more
serious parts of the program in
arranging transportation and ex
hibits. The county had the
largest delegation, really many
more than were allowed on pa
per, and it required nerve to ap
pear on the scene with the multi
tude that the nine autoB took
over, since an ot tne children
who went deserved the trip, and
inasmuch as we had no represen
tation last year, Captain Tou
louse looked at the matter in a
broad way and they all got safe
ly inside.
The auto owners who furnished
the transportation free deserve
all manner of credit. Without
them our delegation would have
been limited and many a little
one left at home who had worked
hard for the trip. --Those who
made the trip both ways es
pecially for the children aside
from Mr. Burt and Mr. Harwell
were Mrs. Mathews, Mr. Burton,
Mr. Marchant, Mr. McGillivray,
Mr. Peterson. Mrs. Mathews
responded to the call at once and
offered the use of the Dodge car.
The others were eqally on the
job and could see pleasure in giv
ing the kids a good time. Even
with this number of cars the
space for the children and bag
gage was limited and others who
were making the trip waited for
the start and made room.
Among these liberal people were
Mr. Elgin. Mr. Dillon, Mr. All
man, Mr. Kemp and Mr. Garvin.
People directly interested in
club work see in the trip success
from every angle. The children
were offered the best opportunity
for enjoyment that the state
furnishes. Club work will con
tinue along the Bame lines and
all club workers may expect a
reasonable reward for their ef
forts while preparing themselves
to become good men and women
