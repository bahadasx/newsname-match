FROM THE CHESTERFIELD BOYS
ON THE BORDER
The following letter from our boys
in Mexico, was received at this office:
Dear Editor:
I write to let you know that the
Chesterfield boys are having a very
^ood time in Camp Stewart. It is
located eight miles west of El Paso,
Texas, at the foot of Mt. Franklin, a
Foothill of the Rockies.
E. D. (or "Red") Vaughn I think
las almost decided to carry home with
iim a Mexican senorita for a souver- 1
lir.
Roy Melton says that the sight of
i horned toad makes him homesick,
(t reminds him of the cow at homo
Will Sellers said that Texas was a
?reat place and that army stations
were fit for a king, but ended by
iaying that old Chesterfield and a
?ood dinner at home would be good
jnough for him.
Fred Huneycutt said that he was
?oing to carry home a pararie dog if
ie had to dig a railroad tunnel to get
turn.
Frank Vaughn is growing a little
l)laek mustache. He says that he
Feels more like chasing Mexicans with
thein, that they will be a great protection
against bullets.
Our division went in review beFore
Gen. Funston last Thursday. It
was the largest parade in the U. S.
since 1865. It was eight miles long
ind required six hours to oass. There
were 40,000 soldiers in line.

Superintendent Coker, of the High
School, has had rather a busy week
taming some of the boys. It is said
that no less than three flights started
on the school grounds and that Mr.
Coker finished each of them.
It is seldom that Mr. Will D. Upshaw
visits a town that he does not
leave some tangible sign of his having
been there. He caused Chesterfield
to take another advanced step and secure
a lyceum course of lectures and
other entertainment. The Piedmont
Lyceum Association will give its first
entertainment in Chesterfield Nov. 6.

people with high-class entertainment 1
to tide over the winter months and '

Considerable interest is being taken
in the preliminary announcement
that the late E. N. Redfearn estate
will be cut up into building lots and
Bmall farms. There iB nearly 700
acres of this choice land. It is understood
that about 40 resident lots
will be laid off in West Chesterfield
and these will be sold to the public.
In addition there will be about a
score of small farms offered for sale
?all on easy terms of one-third cash
the balance in one and two years.
The resident lots will be ideal locations
for building purposes and the
farming land has been known for
years as some of the richest in Chesterfield
County.
