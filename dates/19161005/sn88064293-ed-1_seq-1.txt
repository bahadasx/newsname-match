Th« Day of Atonement
The Day of Atonement or "Yon»
Kippur," the tenth day of the month
of Tisri, begins at sunset Friday, G#
tober 6 and ends at sunset Saturday,
October 7. The thought underlying
the day is expressed in the scriptural
words "On this day He will atone for
you, to purify you from all your
sins." It is a day therefore, of re-
conciliation of man with his fellow-
man and with God, and comes a» • »-
climax to the holiday season which
began Wednesday evening, Septem-
ber 27, with the New Year's Day of
Judgment of ordinary people, who
had been neither completely right-
eous nor utterly sinful was left un-
decided and the opportunity was giv-
en them for repentance; now the
D *y of Atonement provides all men
w ith the P osslbdlt >' of returning to
God and of findin P reconciliation
with Him through prayer,
The da V is the m0Et 8olomr ' t of aH
days ,n the Jewish calendar. It is
. P as8ed in fastin P and PW-
The
whole day is spent in the synagog.
In the evening there is the service
which commences with the chanting
of the well known Kol Nidre prayer.
The day proper has four services.
Of these the Mussaf or additional
service contains a description of the
atonement rites as practiced in the
ancient days in the Temple of Jer
usalem; and theNeilah service is un
derstood to be held at the time when
decision is finally made as to man's
fate, and thus the Neilah prayers in
stead of having the usual phrase,"
"Inscribe us in the book, of life,"
uses the expression : "Seal us in the
book of life."
According to the Jewish tradition
expressed in an ancient law-book the
|) a y 0 f Atonement, when spent in
pra ying and repenting, will bring
pardon for sins between man and
g 0< j ; but as for the sins committed
by man against his fellowman the
p a y cannot bring pardon until he has
appeased his fellowman. This idea is
the basis of the effort always made
before the Day of Atonement to
bring peace between such friends
who have become estranged and are
on unfriendly te'rms with one anoth
1 er; and in this way, the Day will put
the worshipper at peace not only
with his makers, but also with his
fellowman.—Exchange.
