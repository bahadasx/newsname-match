(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Oct. 4. President
Wilson, penetrating the middle
west today for his speech in Om
aha tomorrow, received noisy wel
comes from many thousands of
persons in Ohio and Indiana and
Illinois. He interpreted the en
thusiasm to one crowd as 'meaning
"you believe in me." At -stops
near here the railroad stations
were packed, at several places
bands played and frequently the
President remarked on the cor
diality. Can't Resist Speaking
Refusing to turn his trip into a
speech making tour, the President
nevertheless kept up a running
fire of remarks at every stop.
Mr. Wilson made a brief stop at
Chicago tonight and conferred with.
Manager Walsh in charge of Demo
cratic western headquarters. Senator t
Saulesbury of Deleware, manager of
the senatorial committee and the oth- i
er department beads. Several hundred
persons including local politicians,
railroad men and not a few women
flocked to the train yards and cheered
the President .when he appeared and
shook hands with those nearest him.
' West Is F.r Him
' Senator Walsh told him the middle
west was "more than satisfactory.
At every stop between Pittsburg,
passed early his morning, and Chica
go, the President appeared on the rear
platform of his private car, speaking
to the crowds. He explained that he
was making no speeches and then
shook hands with as many .as possi
ble.' "I am not making a speech mak
ing campaign," said the President at
Lima, Ohio, "but it amuses me and
gratifies ,me very much to get the
greetings I have all along the .line;
and Ohio has certainly shown her hos
pitality." .
What They Wanted Most
"We didn't want a speech, we want
ed to see our President," a man call
ed out - ... ...
"Hurray for the President!" came
another voice amidst applause.
' "I don't think much of my speech
making, but I think it is better than
I am to look at," Mr. Wilson said.
"We want to see Mrs. Wilson," a
man shouted. ,
"I'll admit she Is more worth look
ing at than I am," replied the Presi
dent as he brought his wife forward.
Plain People Right
"You were with us in the 8 hour
day and we are with you," said a man'
at Orreville, O., a railroad town.
"Good," the President replied.
' The Beardless One
When the President stopped at Val
paraiso, Ind., tonight, a crowd includ
ing some students drew him into a
reference to Mr. Hughes' whiskers.
"I havn't any speech to make," said
Mr. Wilson, "I have never met you
before, but your manners are very
familiar. I am mighty glad to see
you." A man in the crowd called out:
"Aren't we glad he hasn't got whis
kers." "You are a clean shaven crowd
yourself," replied the President.
At Fort Wayne, the first stop in In
diana, Mr. Wilson said:
"1 haven't anything to say, my fel
low citizens, except that it is exceed
ingly refreshing to get away from of
ficial duties and out among the fel
lows again, and the sort of greeting
you are giving me fills my heart with
a great deal of gratitude. I am obiged
to you."
In The Neck
A raiiroad trackman, just off duty,
pushed out his hand and said:
"Right there. President. She's dir
ty, but she's going to hit the rooster
hard."
At His Happiest
At Warsaw, Ind., the President said:
"It cheers me very much to have
you come out and give me such a
greeting because times when I am
hard at work, I long very much to get
away and come out and see the folks.
It gives me the deepest gratitude that

NEW YORK, Oct. 4. Dorothy
L'jrnholz, 21 years old, was called
to the bar in court in general sc-s-
sion today to be sentenced for the
theft of $5000 from the lace manu-
facturers who employed her as a
bookkeeper.
"Is there anybody in the court
who is interested in the prison-
er?" asked Judge Wadsworth.
"I am, y'jur honor," replied a
young man.
"Do you realize that this young
woman stands here having con-
fessed that she stole $5000 from
her employers?" asked the court.
I do, sir; but that makes no
difference to me. I believe that
she is honest at heart. I love
her and I want to marry her."
Sentence was suspended when
the 'oung man, who said be was
Harry Richard Mattison, a clerk

Wilson For Peace
Declares Marshall
GREEN BAY, Wis., Oct 4 Vice
President Marshall tonight told a
large audience that the future would
justify President Wilson's policies in
Mexico and with the foreign belliger
ents. "The Democratic party has followed
the true path of neutrality," he said:
"By preventing intervention in Mexi
co, President Wilson avoided the
slaughter of hundreds of America's
best young men.
"I am for an 8-hour law and have
been since 1889 when we passed one
in Indiana. Until Hughes declares he
would repeal the 8-hour law if elect
ed. It is not an issue in the campaign."

Prohibition Champion Says
There Would Be No Vacilla
tion of Watchful Waiting
On His Part.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SIOUX FALLS, S. D.. Oct. 4. In
terventlon in Mexico was advocated
in an address here tonight by Frank
Hanley prohibition candidate for
president. Simultaneously he urged
Charles E. Hughes to answer as to
what he would do in the Mexican sit
uation if he were elected. Hanly said
Hughes had criticized Wilson's Mexi
can policy and now that he had an
nounced his attitude, he would like to
know more of the Republican presi
dential candidates.
Intervention Inevitable
"I believe ' intervention by the
government of the United States
is inevitable and if I were elected
and conditions were as they now
are," Hanly said, "and our present
anomalous relations to Mexican
affairs were still existent, I would
intervene promptly and decisive- .
ly immediately upon my inaugur
ation and assumption of authority
and pause not until safely and
orderly government was estab
lished there, and the good name
and self respect of the I'nited
States restored.
In Mexico As In Cuba
"I would intervene as we inter
vened in Cuba and as we have in
tervened in Haiti and Santo Do
mingo. Intervene not in a war of
aggression or for our own aggran
dizement, but as a friend and
neighbor.
"I would do that, making my
purpose clear, and there would
be no vacillation, no hesitancy."
Says Wilson Blundered
Preceding his declaration for inter
vention, Hanlv said Wilson had erred
in not recognizing Huerta, in sending tions having an international bearing
troops to Vera Cruz, and across the must be an integral part of the general
border in a "purposeless man-hunt" , program for the rehabilitation of Mex
and in holding them on the border UK. the Mexican members of the joint
now. Commission were informed t.lay by
. ts Hunhea In Same Boat ! their American colleagiu 3.
"Watchful wHiting, under Charles
Hughes," Hanly declared, in asking
that Hughes answer him, "would be
no better than 'watchful waiting' un
der Woodrow Wilson."
Warm welcomes were extended the
prohibition candidates both in South
Dakota end Nebraska today as they
worked their way here from Omaha.
Both states vote on a dry amendment
this year and hopes are entertained
by th prohibitionints that they will
win two victories. In South Dakota
however, the proposed amendment Is
coupled with others including woman
suffrage and this situation it is
thought, may delay its adoption.
