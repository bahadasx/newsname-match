RUMANIANS DEFEATED
WITH L0S
Caught by Enarclinc Jvement, and With One Pontoon
Bridge Across Danube
Destroyed Grand Duke
Balkans-Attempt Will Be
victorious at Dobmdja
Sofia, Oct. 5. Bulgarian
destroyed fifteen or sixteen
io,uuu menj wmcn crossed tne Danube and invaded Bul
garia near Riahovo, said an official statement from the
war- office today.
The defeat suffered by the Rumanians is the greatest
since the destruction of the Rumanian army at the fort
ress of Tutrakan, when 22,000 Rumanians were trapped
and captured south of Danube. .
The Rumanians were caught by an encircling move
ment and began to stream back across the river without
offering stubborn opposition. Teutonic monitors had
smashed some of the pontoon bridges over which the in
vaders crossed, thus interfering seriously with their re
treat to the north bank.
Bulgarian artillery was trained on Rumanian trans
ports that attempted to facilitate the retreat, adding to
the confusion in the ranks of the enemy. The exact
number of prisoners is not definitely known, but it is re
ported that large quantities of war material were
brought in.
On the Dobmdja front, all Russo-Rumanian attacks
were frustrated.
The German war office yesterday announced that the
Rumanian force that crossed the Danube had retreated
before a German-Bulgarian encircling movement.
If the Bulgarian statement is ..true, the Rumanians
have suffered two most severe defeats on the Danube in
the five weeks since they entered the war. When Ger
man and Bulgarian forces captured the Rumanian fort
ress of Tutrakan the Rumanian garrison was surrounded
on the south bank and captured. Several hundred Ru
manians, including a general and a number of other of
fers were drowned while attempting to swim the stream.
The Rumanians had occupied several Bulgarian vil
lages before they were attacked by Bulgarian forces from
Rustchuk and Tutrakan.

South American

Lumber
Want Oregon
But Can't Get It
San Francisco, Oct. 5. Stocks of
Xorth American lumber in South Amer
ica are running low because of lack of
ships to carry cargoes from the Pacific
coast, according to Roger Simmons, of
Washington, I). C, government expert,
wiio has just returned from a ten years
study of the subject of South American
lumber conditions. Ho is here today to
confer with lumbermen of Cnliforuin,
Oregon and Washington.
"The Argentine consumes half a b-
lion feet of lumber every year And
three quarters ot this comes from the
United Stutes and Canada," he said.
"(,'hile and Peru, too, are in the mar
ket for huge qunutitiea of North Am

Simmons paid a tribute to South Am
erican business men nf. "brainy and
well educated and having high ethical
business standards." .

'The west is solid for Hughes," said
Fairbanks todav. Kverywhere I have
visited in the wake of his campaign
tour, it Boems a certainty that Hughes
will win by a deeisivo majority. For
that reason, I am giving more attention
to urging upon the people the necessity
of making the republican victory com

SAY SEPARATE PEACE
TERMS DISCUSSED BY
GERMANY AND RUSSIA
By Carl W. Ackerraan
(United Press staff correspondent)
The Hague, Sept. ,10 (Ity inuil.)
Despite official denials that Russia and
Germany recently discussed a separate
peace, i have learned from recent vis
its to -Warsaw, C'opcnhugen audsThe
Hague that some cort of a conference
lid tnke place.
At present, however, there is little
prospect that Russia will desert the al

has changed the situation entirely from
the czar's standpoint.

Say Northwestern Farmers
Are Unit In Holding for
This Price
NORTHWEST MAY HAVE
TO IMPORT SEED WHEAT
Potatoes $1:45 a Bushel In
Chicago Against 48 Cents
Last Year
Chicago,' Oct. 5. Two dollars for
wheat was predicted by Chicago grain
men today before the first of January.
Prices today,' both-cash and futures,
ranged about ten cents lower than the
record price established in January,
1915, immediately following the out
break of the Europeun war.
The heavy decrease in this year's
crop, coupled with discouraging condi
tions in Argentine .and the demand of
the allies for available Australian and
Canadian wheat were pointed to as
fnitors in the present high price. It
wjb stated today at the board of trade
that the northwest has practically no
wheat of seed quality, and that good
seed wheat was now selling at from
four to seven dollars a. bushel.
The importation of Canndian wheat
for seed purposes is being seriously dis
cussed and agricultural experts are can
vassing the question whether or not
the Cunadian wheat will be found
ndnpted to the United States cultiva
tion. . ,
Dealers- in ewu..nent sav that the
northwestern farmer are practically
all adhering to the decision uot to sell
wheat at loss than $2.00 a bushel while
the receipts of grain from other pri
mary shipping points are extremely
light. December wheat has reached
$1.59 :i 4, as against $1.00 a year ago.
.Mnv is 1.!8 1-8 against $1.07 1-8 a
year ago. Cash wheat is selling around
$1.05 depending on the grade, while
the millers are eagerly snapping up
all available milling wheat.
Produce Follows Wheat
As a result of wheat conditions, mill
ers sny, flour continues its steady rise.
I Special brands were quoted today in
i,uicngo ai iu a oarrei wnoiesaie.
Millers say that if the wheat advance
continues,' flour prices will hnve to
keep the jiace.
Members of tho board of' trnde today
said the present high prices could not
be blamed on speculation. They said
that were it 4iot for open trading on
the bonrds of trade, big elevator men
long ago wjtiid have cornered the sup
ply and wheat would have been much
higher than at present.
Produco prices are trailing close be
hind grain. Potatoes are $1.45 a bush
el wholesale ns compared to 48 cents a
year ago. Kggs, butter, poultry and pro
duce and other supplies are up corres
Mndingly in most cases. Dealers blame
fbad weather for the potato shortage
mid say the hot summer damaged pout
try and accounts for high egg prices.
With poor crops goes the heavy de
mand of warring countries for food
and dealers said lower prices were not
to be expected this winter unless an
embargo is established to keep food
stuffs in this country.

Kussia was sad to be willing to iiiiikc

Fight to Prevent Ghost
Walking
Washington, Oct. 5. A parado of po
litical ghosts not rivaled in the history
of the country may rosult if the su
preme court upholds the district court
action of yesterday ordering President
Milton II. Smith of the louisvillo and
NaahviUe railroad, to answer Interstate
commerce commission questions as to
his road's political activities. Federal
experts admitted this today.
Skeletons of the railroad family that
have lain-undisturbed for years may
be brought to light. Charges of politic
al string pullinir by railroads through
out the country particularly with ref
erence to the eight hour law, but also
with reference to campaign contribu
tions have been made unofficially as
reccntlv as the present campaign.
In the Louisville and Xashville case,
it is reported that if Smith is made by
the supreme court to answer all of the
commission's questions, tho Gocbel case
which disrupted Kentucky politics for
years will again be brought into tho
limelight with- perhaps other cases to
follow.
The effect of the district court 's de
cision was to give the commission
Iower to examine nil railway finances,
including political contributions.- This
power never has been admitted by the
railroads and a further bitter fight is
expected before the question is decid
ed. .
If tho decision is sustained, it will
give the commission power to determino
just how millions of dollars that have
figured in state and national politics
were spent if they were spent, as al
legedby the railroads.
That other railroads against which
charges have been made will bo hauled
up to answer was considered about cer
tain. Government investigators havs
accumulated masses of evidence tond
ing to show political activities of oth
er roads and have run into tho stone
wall of "refusals to answer."

LINE OF MARCH JAMMED
LONG BEFORE PARADE
Route From Depot to Club
Room a Continuous Roar
of Cheering
By Robort J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.) '
Omaha,' Neb., Fired by a spectacular
reception from 150,000 Nebraskans,
President Wilson today made his first .
campaign appeal to the west.' Speaking
to the 300 members of the Omaha Com-'
mercial club at ' a noon day luncheon' 1
here,- the president challenged oriticism. :
of his business legislation and defined
its purposes. -He
is in a happy mood. His route'
from the station to tho club had been.
lined with thousands of people who
cheered continuously. His entrance to '
the' banquet room resulted in an ova-'
tion lasting five minutes. ,
At the president's table were many
prominent Ncbrasknn democrats, in
cluding Governor J. H. Morehead, Sen
ator Hitchcock and Mayor Dahlman. - '
Just before luncheon was concluded
ice cream was served In the form of
white doves of peace carrying American
flags. The crowd mingled laughter .'
with cheejrs in an outburst of ap
proval. . -In
introducing the president," J. A."
Sunderland, president of the. Omaha
Commercial club;- expressed . apprecia-'
tinn.that the celebration of Nebraska's
fiftieth anniversary as a state of the
Union, had succeeded in bringing the
president away from his official duties.
Th President Talks,
"I notice, however old the records
of this part of the country may be, noth- ,
K reuuy K"- siarieu unill uv years
ago," the president began. "Sinee that
time this part of tho country has start
ed many things.
"It is useful to make new beein-
n i ncs to break traditions to meet the
conditions arising when shackles vf the
past have been broken off.
" there are mnnv circumstances that
make one feel the present state of tho
world is beyond measure tragical. It is,
however, going to do Amorica a great
service. It is going to make every
American obliged to realize he lives ia .
a new nge full of prosportc and proph-
y. "
"The time has rome when America
has had thrust upon her tho necessity
to participate in world trade. For de
cades we've got to serve the world. It
alters every political question, every
domestic question und those who inist
upon doing new things In tbe old way
are going to be left lit the tail end of
the procession.
"Heretofore it hns been thought
necessary by those who wished to ex
ploit the world. Hereafter it must b
done to gam the confidence of the
world. The ideals of America are to ba
put to the test. It is a pity nut to b
young these days.
"I want you' to know that in my
conception it matter not who does thes
things providing you see to it thnt
they are done. Certain things that havn
recently beeu accomplished by legisla
tion have been accomplished with these
things in mind- In respect to our com
mercial policy I have always been im
pressed with how much attention tho
United Stutes paid to herself and how
little she studied the markets of the
world."
On his way to the reviewing stand
the president passed through throe milea
of the main streets of Omaha. It wn
estimated fully 300,000 people packed
tho thoroughfares and accorded him the.
greatest ovation since he took office,
i lie president was forced to stand ia hia
car throughout the journey. Kvery
building fairly burst with people loan-,
