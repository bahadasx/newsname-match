More Rooms Badly Needc
in City Schools:
Prosperity has filled to overflov
ing High Point's , five school build
ings and at the end of the first, wee!
of the 191647 school term it if
found that 2,004 children areTre,
istered, many more than there )ii
room to accomm6date or teacherc
to instruct. .
Many of the, teachers have , more
than 50 scholars when 'the authori
ties say that say no teacher should
have morejhan 25 under her suter
vision. In one room there is .j the
sixth grade with its- 21, pupils arid
lojnembersiof the third grade arc
there also. JLt is obvious that effec
tive work can not' be done under
such strained conditions.: " But there
seems to be a a remedy at present
although the situation demandSvthat
more public school buildings be '.
erected in this city. . ' ' .
With the 2,004 school children in
school, not many more than half of ,
the children between the school
ages are- .enrolled at that. It is ;
realized, however, that many untfer,' ;
'21 years, probably between 17 and .
21, can never be reached by a school. j!
It is a fact, however, that there are fj!
probably .00 children here between
the ages of eight and 12, the com-: j
piilsory attendance age, that are not V
attending. With an enforcenlent of
this law, conditions would only be,
made worse for there would - be;. no ?
room to house tle children. ,
