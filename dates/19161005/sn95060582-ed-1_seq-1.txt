How Catarrh Is Contracted
Mothers are sometimes so
thoughtless as to neglect the colds
which their children contract.
The inflammation of the mucus
membrane, at first acute,- be
comes chronic and the child has
chronic catarrh, a disease that is
seldom cured and that may prove
a life's burden. Many persons
who have this loathsome disease
will remember having had fre
quent colds at the time it was
contracted. A little forethought
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy judiciously used, and all
this trouble might have been
avoided. Obtainable every
where. Adv.
The time has arrived in the
history of Apache County when
the laws must be adminstrated
free from malice and spite.
County officials .must be taught
that if they perform their duties
under oaths, and in av fearless
honest, and impartial manner the
people will endorse and approve.
The citizens of Apache county
are fully aware of the way in
which officials position has been
prostituted to the gratification of
personal animosities and private
predjudice. How far this has
gone is known only to those who
have' had occasion to investigate
the matter, and at the proper
time and in the correct place;
attention will be directed to these
proceedings.

WE SOLICIT YOUR BUSINESS
What will probably prove to be
one of the most productive copper
mines in Arizona is being opened
up in Graham county about seven
miles from the town of Geronimo,
on the Arizona Eastern Railway,
by the Geronimo Mining .com
pany. This company incorporat
ed under the laws of Arizona,
holds 100 full mining claims, com
prising over 2000 acres.
This property, while compara
tively untouched as to surface,
has indications of being the best
mineralized group of claims in
Arizona. A 64 foot shaft has
been sunk on the property, and
is in ore every foot of the wav.
A number of old drifts and
tunnels which have been driven
into the ground at a number of
points indicate that pay ore is to
be struck at almost any point on
the property right at the grass
roots. J. W. Sterling, the engineer
who is at present on the property
conducting an examination, states
in his report to the company, that
the indications are that the pro
perty will develope into one of
the most wonderful ore bodies in
the state.
The fact that the property is
but seven miles from a railway
will greatly simplify the work of
development. A spur to the pro
perty will encounter a grade of
only 3 per cent according to Mr.
Sterling's figures. Ideal locations
for a townsite and for mill and, '
smelter sites are also to be found
on the property, and the rich
farming districts o f the Gila
Valley are but a few miles away.
Until quite recently the pros
pect was practically unknown
being in the hands of the original
locators, who made little effort to
bring it before the public. Now
however a syndicate of Miami
mining and business men have
hold of the proposition, and the
chances are good that the pros
pect will be put in the producing
class in a very short time.
