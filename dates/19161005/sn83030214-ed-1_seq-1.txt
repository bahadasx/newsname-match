ing Germans.
London, Oct. 4.?Britain needs more
men.
"We are not Justified in experting
to win the war unless the service of
every man nnd woman in the country
is utilized to the fullest extent," said
Bir William Robertson, chief of the
Imperial Staff, in a sptcch to-day at
Paldciby, Lincolnshire.
"We rr.ust be under no drlusinn,"
said Robertson. "as to the end or prob
able duration of this great struggle.
We must be prepared to continue for a
time which cannot at present be csti
rr.ated.
"In fact, we must prcpare for the
went, while we hope for tbe best. We
hr.ve adopted in theory the principle
of national service. We must see that
we put :t into practice, because we
want more men, and we want them
now. amJ eventually w? shall want all
who can be spared."
The Man Power Distribution Hoard,
appointed reeently to comb the coun?
try for slackcm, reported toaday that
Britain was in urgent need of men for
her arrr.ics and her munitions fac
torics.
Irish ( onscriplion Soon To Be l'p.
These statements have given new
strength to the agitation for applying
conscription to Ireland. When I'nrlia
ment assembles next week. the gov?
ernment will be confronted with the
problem which looms larger than ever.
The Man' Powei Dirtribution Hoard
in its report directed that r.o ex<*mp
tion be granted ccrtaln classc hereto
f.ra exemDt and that there be more
general 'ilution of skilled labor in
on factories with women nnl
other workirs heretofore untrained. It
ivggeated coafereBeea ot employers and
employei witb a vlew to freeing skilled
labor now engaged in private work .or
empiovmont in munitions plants.
"It ii esaeatial," the report says,
"that a large part of the labor now
engaged in private work shall be
diverted to governmeal orders or re
leai ad far the arrajr."
The board alao haa .inrler con?idera
tion the extended n l of women and
of mrn over the military age, and aiso
the release ot inen oi military age now
emploved in government oTice , This
is the only means, the board says,
wherebv extension of the age for com-|
puKoiy service can be avoided.
The "Tiaaaa" and other newspapers
reeently have been conducting a fctrong
campaign, urging that the Irish be
drafted. Sir Kdward Carson has joined
the agitation.
Sir Kdward asserts that the ntuation
is sueh that without conscription in
Ire'and it will be impossible efen to
maintain the Irish regiments at the
,'ront in their proper strength. He con
?mds that Ireland could provide an

The Nationalists. in reply to S,r r.il

nies alreHdy have self-government, and
l.ence there is no analogy with the pa*
Bitloa of Ireland. They assert that

The Liher.1 newspapers ronsider the

while conscription in Ireland would
provide a few men it would provoke
another first class Irish crisis and
throw Ireland into the hands of the

(?n board the Presidential special,
Valparaiso, Ind., Oet 4. President
Wilson's trip through the Mlddle West
has been thus far one of rear platform
repartee. Although not one of the
large and noisy crowds which greeted
him in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois could
?empt him into making a formal speech,
he has had something to say some
thing ralculated usualiy t<> draw a
laugh at every stop.
Leanlng over the tail of his private
car, the President has shaken thou?
sands of hands, with his lip* mechan
?cally repeating that he was not on a
sprochmnking tour. and his ears open
for any remarks from the crowd *o
which a pointed rejoinder might be
hurnedly titted.
"I am not starting on any campaign
of speerhmakinij," he said at I.ima,
Ohio, "but it touches me and gratifies
me very much to get the greetings I
have all aloni* the line. Ohio has cer?
tainly alaewaj her. hetapitalitjr."

"We want to see Mr-. \\ i son." an?
other man shouted.
"I'll admit she is better worth lookir.g
at thaa I aaa," aaid Mr. Wilsaa, as he
brought his wife forward.
At Woo^ter, Ohio, this cheering in
formation came from the crowd:
"I heard a Republican say to-day
that he was going to vote for you."
"Then," said the President, "he must
be a good man."

??Vou were with us in the eight-hour

"Good'." was the Presidential com
ment. . .
When the President stopped here
to-night a crowd, including some
itudents, drew him into reference to
Mr Hughea's whiskers.
A man in the crowd calied out:
"Aren'f we glad ho hasn't got
whiskers!"
?You are a clean-shaven crowd your

Glad To Be Out Again.
At Fort Wayne, the tirst Itop ia

A railroad brakeman, just off duty,
pushed out his bniid and said: "Right

SEIZE N. J. MILK
Pickets Empty Cans Into
Roiids?Cut Off New
York Delivery.
N'ewton, S. J.. Oct. 4. Night riders
and day riders have go complctely dom
mate.i the situat on in thia, the richest
dairy district of the state, that not a
lingtfl can of milk waa sent to New
Vork fro nith? big paeteurizing piants
near here to-day.
Twelve pickets of the Da.rymen's
LeagBfl dei">d a sheriff and his deputy.
pulled them from a truck load of rrnln
and emptied the entire stock of one
plant into the road near here this
morning. Another -quad of RBBflkfld
min cntert-d the Keystone Dairy Cor.i
pany'a plant, at Warbasse, in daylighr,
drove away the guards and emptied ail
the milk being prepar.-i for flipaaiat
N'o matter what Btataaaaata repr. -
-. Btativaa of tho big diatribatiag eaa
eerni in New Vork may be making to
night, the farmers kno-.v little milk is
reaching the city. except such stock as
fltay be hauled from ne4v centr.-s in
Mainc or as far north as Montrcal.
Their present hope is this supply may
be cut ofT by the Health Department
becanae of inability to inspect piants
v.) t'ar from the metropolis.
Pickets lialt Sheriff.
Sheriff Frank WiIbop of S I
CountJ -'Oiiteil with a dilerrimj
ahortly befora sunnse this maraiag
when a truck load ot milk on whirh
he and his deputy were riding a"
guardians was surrounded by five
automobile loads of picket... The
SheriiT, who is a milk producer and
in complete sympathy with the strik
ing farmers, argued his dutv com
pelled him to protect the milk. He
tapped hia revolver repeatedly, but his
frienda refused to take the implud
threat seriously. After more than an
hour's argument the leader of the
picket crew made the .Sheriff an otfer.
"We'll submit to arrest after we g-'t
through here," they said.
The Sheriff and his deputy, unable
to win by diplomacy, stood aside while
the cans were emptied into the road.
Then they Wfltchld the pickets climb
into their machines and go to the
Coirt House here, 4vhere they w< I
loekld up on charges of highway rob- ?
bery. j
Kach man was held under $1,000
pending a hearing by the De
cember grand jury, after 4vhich he
resumed his picket duties where, if j
milk appeared, he was prepared to ,
dump it into the road.
l.ouis Tolin*. representing the New
York Health Department, contributed
ro the work of the farmers by closing
the plant of the Schwartzwood Dairy
Company, at Schwartzwood, N. J., to
W.v Vork shipments. The company
had Bgned to pay the higher price for
milk. and was planning to send a large
consignment to the city when the in
ipaetor swooped down upon it in the
morning, and after finding what he aaid
were numerou. violations of New York
retrulations, forbade shipment.
Farmers throuirhout this portion of
the milk producing country insist that
thev will accept r.o compromiae in the
matter of priees. They are armed with
many figure3 to prove they cannot pro?
duce milk at the rates now paid by the
distributing corporations.
I.oaa to Farmera Shown.
Figures compiled by a committee
headed by r'nrrn Bureau Agent Milli
man. at >fiddletown, show that the coat
of producing milk in New Vork State
farms last year was 4.06 cents a quart.
fhil is exactly a cent more than the
BVfliagfl price paid the farmers for milk
for that period.
ln -pito af this aeeming loss by the
milk producers, practically every cow
owner in this part of the atate pos
Baaaifl an automobile and is spending -
hn present leiaure r.ding about the
stae on picket duty or pleasure. With
a fi-.v excepttons, they say their finan
cia! standing will permit them to carry
on the present war for two or three
weeks longcr.
Bankers 4* ith whom the milk farmera
transact their business say they owe
practically no money. The farmers
answer this by saying this is due to
their ability to get practically all of
their labor free. Wives an.l ehildren
who act as belpera get nothmir in ra
turn for their etforts. the farmers say, I
whereas a husinesslike management of '
the farm would show labor cost more j
than tne actual price paid for the
product.

Most signifu-ant among vester

was the decision of this "oncern,
representing one-fifth of tbe milk
distributing industry in the metro
politan district. to withdra<v from

Pairymen's league, suggcr'cd by
Mayor Mit.-hel an.l District At'orney

ident, ti offer the milk producers 35
cents advance a hundr^dwcight over
I the price paid for October milk a
j year ago. Thia compromise brings

farmei-i=.
John J. Pillon. Commissioner of
Fh.hIs an.l Markots. an.l spokesman
tr.r the Pairymen's league. refused
ti c.mment last night on the Bor?
den directors' action. "I had some
talk with one of the Borden officials
to-day about the situation," Mr. Dil?
lon said. "We shall get together
probably again in the morning. As
lar as the league is concc^.ed, the
farmers will hold out for their full
price."
More Conceaaions F.'ipected.
It is expeetcd that the Borden di
lectors will meet again this morn?
ing to dis.-ii<s the posiibility of mak
ir;rr further roncessions in price to
the milk producers.
These etforts at adjustment of the
situation by the largest distributcr
followed the collapse of Mayor
Mitchel's plan to bring the farmers
and the dealers to satisfactor?
terms. All of the other dealers, in?
cluding the Sheffield Farms-Slawson-e
Pecker Company and the MutuaU
McDermott Corporation, informed
the Mayor they would agree to offer
an advance of 31 cents or approxi
mately 70 per cent of the demand.
"We insiat on 45 cents more a hun?
dred pounds," replied Mr. Dillon and
offieiala of the league. The deadloclt
was in force again. Mayor Mitrhel
announced that he was leaving the city
on a hunting trip. "I've done all I can
without success," he aaid.
Monopoly Inquiry To-morrow.
Attorney General Egburt E. Wood
bury announced his investigation of
the counter charges of conspiracy,
under the Donnelly anti-monopoly act,
will begin to-morrow morning at BBJ
Broadway. Justice Bijur has appoint?
ed William N. Dykman, of Brooklyn,
as referee to take testimony. Merton
E. Lewis, First Deputy Attorney C.en
eral, will examine witneases for the
state.
"The purpoae of thia inquiry is to
determine, fairly and impartially, how
far there may have been unlawful
combination*. in restraint of trade for
controlling the price of thia important
necessity of life," the Attorney Gene?
ral said. Mr. Lewis added that the
investigation may bring out facts rela
tive to desiirnating a fair and reason
able price the consumer ought to pay
for milk.
Careful estimates place yeaterday's
milk shortage between 40 and 50 pee
cent. For the Borden Company it waa ,
the most discouraging day of the strike, J
onlv .'12 per cent of the normal aupply /
arnving in the city. All the large dn?'
tributers, however, report that they ?/
pect marked inereases in their dy*?
