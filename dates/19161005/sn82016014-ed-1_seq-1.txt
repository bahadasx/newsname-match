Flirtation at Revival Meeting
Was the First Step.

Testifies to Meeting in a Barn
'ear Topeka.
Flirtation and revival meetings are
curiously mixed in the Hamilton
Azlein "white slave" case on trial in
the first division of the district court.
Henry Hamilton, retired farmer living
in Oakland, is charged by Mrs. Stella
Azlein, a young married woman, with
having enticed her into improper re
lations with him, and she testified to
day that it all began with a flirtation
at a revival meeting.
The courtroom is crowded today.
Many Oakland people are attending.
A dozen or more women are listening
to the more or less sensational tes
timony, but Mrs. Azlein's testimony,
more sensational than that of any oth
er witness, was a disappointment to
the crowd. She kept her hand to her
mouth and directed her answers in a
low tone to the jury. Frequently her
words failed to reach even the attor
neys. Mrs. Azlein is a small, black haired.
black-eyed woman, slender almost to
girlishness. When not on the stand,
her broad black hat hid her face from
the courtroom audience and even
when on the stand she seldom lifted
her eyes from the floor. Off the stand
she sat behind the county attorney
and his assistants with her husband,
a young, blonde-haired man. They
chatted together frequently and the
husband gave only a casual ear to the
testimony.
On the other side of the long table
nat Henry Hamilton with his attor
ney?. He listened to every scrap of
testimony and consulted with his
counsel at frequent intervals. He Is
an ordinary looking middle-aged man,
smooth-shaven and plainly dressed.
He was a widower at the time of his
alleged relations with Mrs. Azlein, but
has since married. He has two chil
dren in their teens and is reputed to
be the owner of considerable property.
Re-Told Her Story.
Mrs. Azlein was on the stand most
of the morning session. She retold
the story related by her at the pre
liminary hearing held :n the court of
Topeka last summer. Most of her
story was brought out by questions.
She stated that she fir3t met Hamil
ton at a revival meeting in Oakland
las: Decmber while her husband was
in Iowa. He left about the middle of
the month and most of the acts com
plained of by Mrs. Azlein occurred be
tween that time and Christmas eve
when the husband returned. In an
swer to questions by the county at
torney Mrs Azlein stated that at the
revival meeting Hamilton slipped her
a note asking that she allow him to
call at hir nouse that night. She stated
that she shook her head, indicating
no" but that the next dav she wrote
a note telling him to come There
she hesitated.
Go on," said Robert Carver.
"I met him on Ihe nnrch " vo r.n
tinued, "and told him our relations
"ium cease; mat l had a good hus
band." "What did he say'.'"
"He told me to let him come in:
."l he wouId never let anyone know
Children Were in Bed.
She told the jury that the children
were in bed at the time and that there
was a neighbor child sleeping with
them. She didn't tell how Hamilton
persuaded her to let him in but she
did say he went in. then she broke
into tears. She repeated th- story of
ner experience with Hamilton in the
house that night that she told at the
preliminary.
Then Mrs. Azlein came to the point
in her story upon which th-; state
liases its "white slave" charge.
"One Sunday night," she said. "I
was on my way to the Christian
church when I met Hamilton at the
corner of Chester and Thomas on his
way to the Methodist church. He
stopped me and suggest d that we go
to his house. I did not want to go.
"After while we went to a vacant
house across the street from here he
now lives, but his keys wouldn't fit
the door and we couldn't get in.
'Well,- he said to me, 'I've got a
mighty good barn." and we went to
the barn. I didn't want to go with
him at all but he said to me. 'If you
don't go I'll tell what we have done
so your old man will find it out.' " '
The vacant house and the barn de
scribed by Mrs. Azlein are three
blocks from the corner at which she
Mates she met Hamilton. And the
state is charging that Hamilton en
ticed, persuaded and procured Mrs.
Azlein from the street corner three
blocks away to the barn, thereby vio
lating the Kansas "white slave law."
Cross-Examination.
on cross-examination Kd lioonev
attorney for Hamilton, attempted to
show by Mrs. Azlein that this case is
preliminary to a damage suit against
the wealthy Oakland man. Bv nu
merous question he brought out that
Mr. and Mrs. Azlein visited the office
of an attorney today before they
reached the court house and discussed
a damage suit with the attorney
Mrs. Azlein admitted having visited
the office of M. O. Lock but stated
that her husband carried on the con
versation and that she knew nothing
or its purpose.

Drag Driver Off Wagon in East
Side Riot.
SEND DEPUTIES UP-STATE
Endeavor to Suppress Picketing
by Dairymen.
Farmers Demand 45 Cent In
crease; 35 Cents Offered.
New Tork, Oct. 5. A serious dis
order growing out of the milk situa
tion took place here today when it
was necessary to call police reserves
to disperse more than 500 women,
mostly foreigners, many with babies
in arms, who stormed the two health
department milk stations in Harlem.
The women had previously canvas
sed stores in the neighborhood in
search of milk for their children and
finding none for sale they gathered at
the city stations. A few were ad
mitted. Those on the outside fearing
that tho supply would be exhausted
before they could be served rushed
the doors of the building.
Mob Seizes Milk Wagon Supply.
New York, Oct. 5 The milk famine
got to the riot stage today. Police
blotters showed trouble on the East
Side where famished women and chil
dren took desperate steps. In one in
stance, a driver was dragged from his
cart, while a mob of 200 drained it of
every drop of milk.
Milk lines have been established in
some sections. There " meagre por
tions ar doled out. One man started
a row when refused a larger quantity
but women behind him made him de
sist by threats to attack him if he
persisted.
Up-state the night riders are busy
and extra deputies have been called.
particularly in northern Westchester
county to guard creameries against
attack.
Pinch Greater Than Ever.
While distributors had new sources
of supply, city officials estimated that
the pinch was greater than at any
time since dairymen up-state reiusea
to sell to the Big Three at existing
rates.
One hope of a break in the dead
lock was the fact that there were
signs of weakening upon the part of
the Borden company, distributors of
one-fifth of the city supply. They
have already offered a 35-cent per
hundred pounds increase for October,
while others in the Big Three have
trailed at 31 cents. The farmers are
standing out for a 45-cent raise and a
six month contract.
talked about a damage case?" was
asked.
"I don't know that we've talked ;o
much about it," she replied.
"What do you mean by 'so much?
Then you have talked about it."
"No, we haven't," said the woman.
"Well, are you going to bring a
damage case?" asked Rooney.
"I don't know what we'll do. We
want to get this case settled first."
Mrs. Azlein testified to this state
ment on the part of Hamilton, once
when she was at his house:
"I'll see you in before I'll give
you any of my money."
At the same time she denied hav
ing said anything to lead him to be
lieve she wanted any of his money.
Defendant's Testimony.
One of the first escapades of Mr.
Hamilton and Mrs. Azlein, according
to his testimony, was a trip to Topeka
and an afternoon at a local theater,
at which time, she said, he tried to get
her to go to a room with him. In con
nection with this alleged trip Hamil
ton's attorney offerod the following
note as evidence and Mrs. Azlein iden
tified it as one she had written to
Hamilton:
"WThere was you today? I said
go to town Thursday on that papper.
What made you go yesterday? I
seen you on the corner but could not
go. I can talk better than I can
write. I doubt wheather you can
read this. I want to go to town to
morrow but don't know for sure.
If I do will take a car between one
and two but if you are on the car
I am don't let on. And whatever
you do keep this to yourself. Now
if you don't you know it allways
comes back home. Less go to the
Novelty. Don't think the preacher
will care and if she does, 1 should
worry. Burn, burn, burn, burn.
This will burn."
Irwin Phillips of 223 Forest avenue
followed Mrs. Azlein on the stand. He
testified that Hamilton admitted to
him that he had taken Mrs. Azlein to
the Novelty.
Patrolman Billings was- also called.
He quoted Hamilton as saying to him
on one occasion. "I may have flirtad
with her a little.'but all these other
allegations are false." He also testi
fied that Hamilton once rennrtpn m
I him that Mrs. Azlein had jeered at
mm Decause ne did not visit her, say
ing: "If you were game you would come
up. You know my husband wouldn't
be at home."
That summed up the state's evi
dence. Attorney Rooney moved to dis
miss the case against Hamilton on the
ground that the state had furnished
no corroborative evidence nothing to
support Mrs. Azlein's story. The court
held that the letter introduced by the
defense and admitted by Mrs. Azlein
was sufficient corroborative evidence
to permit it to go to the jury. The
court overruled the motion and the
case proceeded.

called from the scene of his triumphs
in the Caucasus to command the
Russo-Rumanian drive against Bul

operating in Dobrudja and on the
Danube. He may act as an adviser of
the Rumanian commanders in Tran

The Stockholm report, as yet un
confirmed from Petrograd aroused
the greatest interest here because of
the renewal of heavy fighting in the
Balkans both on the Rumanian fron
tier and Macedonia.
The arrival of the grand duke on
the Rumanian border It is believed
will be the signal for the opening of
the double-barreled allied offensive
to crush Bulgaria and close the Aus-tro-German

100 Students at Breakfast.
Brother Abban saw flames creeping
across the fifth floor, and without
taking time to discover the cause of
the fire, he rushed downstairs and
gave the alarm.
The students and faculty members
who were in the dining room rushed
out of the building but by that time
the fifth floor was cut off by the fire
and it was impossible to reach the
two aged men there. Students who
gathered on the campus saw Nolan,
the assistant nurse climb on the fifth
floor window sill and jump.
Two firemen had reached the fourth
floor on scaling ladders, but just then
tho flames enveloped Nolan and he
leaped to the lawn below.
The building destroyed was a six
story structure. Apparently the fire

near the elevator shaft and spread

Plan to Offset the Work of the
WILL FIX A SCALE OF WAGES
Will Include the Kitchen Maids
and Rug Beaters.
Also ihe Large Contingent of
"Odd Job" Men.
A "federal union" to enroll the
common or unskilled laborers and
workers in the minor crafts. In the
city, will be the next move on tha
part of labor organizations In Topeka.
The new union Is the result of a move
ment in organized labor to offset th
evil policy of the I. W. W. and to ed
ucate the common laborer in the idea .
unionism.
This was announced today by Frank
Brown, organizer for the A. F. of L..
who With Paul Montgomery, J. O.
Stevic and other prominent union men
of the city will organize the "federal
union." The campaign will be start
ed some time within the next month,
with a meeting in Industrial hall.
"At a conservative estimate there
are 3,000 common laborers or workers
in minor and unorganized crafts in
Topeka," Frank Brown said today. "It
is the latest plank in the national
platform of the A. F. of L. to reach
out after these. Many have sur
rendered to the affiliation with the I.
W. W. We will go after these also.
As the membership of the different
minor crafts in the federal union in
creases enough to warrant it, the men
will be separated from the 'federal'
and local unions formed."
The formation of several new locals
will undoubtedly be an upshot of the
organization.
When the federal union becomes
stronger a big program of fixing and
bettering wages and conditions in al
most every class of unskilled labor
will be entered upon. The housewife
of the future in Topeka may be pay
ing, according to a definite union
scale, the man who beats her rugs and
rakes the leaves.
As the union becomes larger the
different classes of unskilled labor are
to be organized into local unions. But
the large residue of "odd Job" men ia
expected to make it the biggest local
in the city.
