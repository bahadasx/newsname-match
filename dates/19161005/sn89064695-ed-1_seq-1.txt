Minnesota's Eight Hour
Law.
If Minnesota deemed it for the
best interests of mankind to pass
a law making eight hours the limit
of a day's manual labor, why
should any of its citizens find
fault because Congress passed a
law fixing eight hours a the limit
for a day's work of railroad em
ployees?
If eight hours is long enough
for manual labor employees of
Minnesota it should be long enough
for employees of railroad com
panies.
Minnesota's law limits a certain
class of its employees to eight
hours a day of work, and none of
its employees in offices work more
than eight hours a day, or from
nine o'clock a. m. to five o'clock
p. m.
The United States requires its
employees to work not to exceed
eight hours per day, and this law
or rule has been in force for many
years, so that when it is taken in
to consideration that both the Uni
ted States and the State of Minne
sota have fixed for their own em
ployees an eight hour law, an un
prejudiced mind will not find any
fault with Congress for passing a
similiar law to apply to the em
ployees of railroads. Congress
besides this, did only what the
legislature of Minnesota did sev
eral years ago, passed a law to
regulate the work of the employ
ees of railroad companies. For
tunately for Minnesota there were
no politics involved in the matter
when the legislature passed the
bill prescribing the limit for rail
road men to work, and it received
but very little attention.
In all the offices of the large
cities of this country eight hours
is the schedule fixed for office
work, or from nine a. m. to five
p. m.
The greatest objection that has
been made by President Wilson's
political opponents is that he
urged Congress to pass the eight
hour law, but it must be borne in
mind that the exigencies of the
situation caused Congress to do
what it did more than the strong
recommendations of the president,
and that a large majority of repub
lican congressmen voted for the

Colonel Henr Watterson, who
once expressed the opinion that
the Sherman whiskers would mire
the Republican party, id reported
now to have declared that the
Hughes whiskers will cost the
Republicans thousands of votes.

Tribal War Averted At
Indian Meeting.
Cedar RaDids, Iowa, Sept. 28.
At the second day's session of the
Society of American Indians here,
an Apache challenged an Arapahoe
to combat during a clash over &
resolution proposing the abolish
ment of the Federal Indian bureau.
Dr. Charles L. Montesuma, an
Apache, in the course of an im
passioned speech attacking the In
dian bureau as inefficient directed
his remarks at Dr. Sherman Cool
idge of Colorado, an Arapahoe In
dian, president of the society and
a former member of the federal
bureau.
I am an Apache" he shouted,
"and you are an Arapahoe. I can
lick you. My tribe has licked
your tribe before."
"I'm from Missouri" shouted
Dr. Coolidge and the laughter
that followed broke the tension.
Both sessions of the conference
were heated. The treatment ac

Speaking sentimentally and not
microscopically, there is a lot in
whiskers. While the Democrats
are chortling with glee over the
nomination of a Republican presi
dential candidate with ornate face
dusters, they must not overlook
the fact that whiskers have played
an important part in American
politics. And the facial porch

been on the winning side.

The Chippewas of Bad River
Reservation in Wisconsin, held a
fair last week commencing on
Wednesday and ending on Fnd y.
The loaded passenger trains
from Ash laud were met daily at
the railroad station at Odanah by
the Chippewa band there, and the
band rendered several selections
each time unusually well.
Among the players were two
former members of the White
Earth band, namely Henry and
William Mannypenny, members
of this reservation, who are at
present with their parents who
live at Odanah.
The main exhibition building on
the fair grounds contained an ex
hi bit of Indian handiwork, lace
woik, vegatables and preserved
fruits which was a credit to the
members of the Bad River Reser
vation,--**
The livestock exhibit was an
other fine feature of the fair, and
especially the draught horsos,
which were better than those us
ually exhibited at ordinary county
fairs.
The fair was well attended by
whites and Indians, and was ap
parently a success in every re
spect.
Indian fairs each year are be
coming a feature of the Bad River
Reservation, and Major P. S.
Everest, the superintendent of the
reservation, deserves much credit,
for by his activity and encourage
ment he has made the fairs what
they are.
During our visit at the fair we
met a large number of mixed
blood Indians through the courtesy
of Rev. J. W. Martin, a minister
of the Presbyterian church, who
is a member of the Bad River
Reservation and located at Odanah.
Among the persons whom we met
were Mr. Ashmun, and his son
who is the publisher and editor of
The O lanah Star John Stodard,
Alex Roseau, Robert Morrin, and
many others.
Among old friends and acquaint
ances whom we formerly knew and
whom we also met were Rev. Louis
Mannypenny and the members of
his family, Chas. and Dan Morri
son, who made many inquiries
about friends upon this reserva
tion and at Red Lake, William
O'Bern, Joseph Neveaur and his
sons, Bazile Decoteau. who is now
married and has a family of three
children, Mr. Holmes, who is a
member of the Mille Lac band of
Chippewas but has for years been
living at Odanah where he is mar
ried to a member of the Bad River
Reservation, and Antione Naga
nub and his family.
We had the good fortune of be
ing one of a party of four persons
from here, namely Rev. C. H.

Melrose, who has been in these
parts long enough to be entitled
to a residence, and ourself.

The Red Lake Fair.
The Red Lake Chippewas have
set a pace for the Minnesota Chip
pewas to follow, and hava aroused
an interest in Indian fairs amon
the Indians of the state.
From information obtained from
persons from this reservation who
attended the Red Lake fair, it was
a big success in every respect the
display of farm produce, Indian
bend and other work, being much
better than the average.
The amusements were many and
varied, and the whites who attend
ed the fair enjoyed it immensely
according to all accounts.
With regard to Indian fairs, it
is suggested that the annual 14th

made a combination celebration
and Indian fair.

This reservation has some ad
vantages over the other reserva
tion and ceded reservations in this
state and should be able to get up
an unusually good Indian fair.
A fair which could take place
here during the annual 14th of
June celebration m'ght not have a
display of farm produce, but out
side of a vegatable display, it
could get up a display of live
stock, Indian work, etc. which
would be second to none on any
Indian reservation in the country.

Although it is several months
since the Supreme Court of the
United States reversed itsolf in the
Heff case, it is not generally known
in this state where many Indians
reside and hold allotments of land
under trust patents.
It will be recalled that the Heff
case involved the sale of mtoxica
ting liquor to an Indian who had
received an allotment of land, and
that the defendant set up in justi
fication of the charge against him
that the allottee was a citizen of
the United States and was there
fore not a ward of the govern
ment, and that the sale of liquor
to him was not a violation of law.

The Nice case reached the Su

and that court decided that while
an Indian held a tract of land as
an allotment under a trust patent
he remained a ward of the govern
ment and was a tribal Indian that
this wardship terminated only
after the expiration of the trust
period, and that during this period
the United States could continue
to regulate the traffic of intoxica

locality of the Indian has nothing
to do with this power, and the
right to exercise it remained in
