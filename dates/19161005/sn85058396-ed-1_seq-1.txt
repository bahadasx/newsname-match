WIRELESS WAR
REPORTJNTRUE
Bucharest Despatch Denies
German and Bulgarian De
feats of Rumanian
Forces.
London, Oct. 5, 10:15 a. m. A dis
patch from Bucharest by way of
Rome, as given out by the Wireless
Press today, denies the statement of
the German and Bulgarian war offices
that Austrian monitors have destroj'
ed the bridge across the Danube south
of Bucharest over which the Ruman
ians passed to invade Bulgaria. It is
said the passage of troops, munitions
and stores continues.
The dispatch also says the battle In
Dobrudja Is increasing in violence
and that the Germans and Bulgarians
are suffering enormous losses.
While the foregoing inferentlally
contradicts the German and Bulgarian
reports of the complete defeat of the
Rumanians, who invaded Bulgaria, It
is possible that the dispatch was sent
from Bucharest before tho Bulgarians
began their attack on the Invaders
whoso defeat was first announced by
the German war office on October 3.
