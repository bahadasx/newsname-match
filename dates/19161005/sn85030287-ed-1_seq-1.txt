' By FRANK G. ODELL.
Editor of the Nebraska Farm Magazine
Do you know that your post office
Is now an employment bureau;? Tlut
is one of the new things Uncle Sam
has started during the present Ad
ministration. Secretary Wilson .of the
Department of .Labor hns tackled the
task of bringing the jobless man and
the manless job together, and now
every post office Is an agency of 'the
United States employment service.
The postmaster is equipped with
blanks for listing applications for la
bor or for employment and Is instruct
ed 'to, help get 4he worker and the job
In contact. .
While this might appear to be prin
cipally In the Interest of the worker,
It is really one of the numerous far
reachlng things started for the bene
fit of the farmer by the Administra
tion of President Wilson. The increas
ing scarcity of farm labor has become
a problem to the farmer, especially
in the wheat-strowln;? and fruit-growing
sections. This labor, which is of a
seasonal thtiraetur, necessarily must
be" performed largely by itinerant
workers." Some agency which will
meet this demand and relieve the la
borer of the graft of employment
agencies Is necessary. Uncle Sain has
Ktarted it.
fX single illustration will lv how
. the s..'Mtem works; in the Willamette
Valley of 'Oreftos. thousands of.tem-
porary workers are needed In hop
picking time. On August 12(1 the Ore
gon Journal of Port laud printi-d a
news article about the new govern
ment employment agency, stating
that six hundred families could ob
tain Immediate employment in the
hop yards by applying at the Portland
division of the Federal employment
service.
This, is unolher item added to th
' mnis of accumulating evidence which
shows that the Wilson' Administration i
lias tried to give both labor and the
farmer a square deal. For the first
time in history, this Administration
' has placed the needs of rural districts
squarely before Congress as of equal
importance with the interests of finan
cial centers. 1
And why not? . Financial centers
would not amount to much without the
nlne-liillion-dollar crop of the Ameri
can farmer. Hut the interests of the
farmer have not always been so promi
nently and favorably considered by
Congress ns they have during the past
three years. The record of Democrat
ic cla'ms fov'fanner support is a rec
ord of accomplishment. It reads like
this ii the passage of laws and admin
istrative acts:
What Hns Been Dine for the Farmer.
". CUKUKXCY REFORM: The Fed
eral Reserve Act under which the
farmer's paper is given special con
sideration, including permission to
National Banks to loan on the security
. of farm lands.
RUUAt, CllEDITS: An epoch-making
legislative measure which will re
lieve the farmer of the incubus of the
short-time loan at extortionate inter
est. This measure alone, when in
full force, will save the farmers of the
United States one hundred and fifty
million dollars annually in interest
charges.
GOOD KOADS : Seventy-five mil
lion dollars made available for the
development of roads from the furiu
to the market, under conditions which
will prevent wasteful use of the money.
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION :
.. The passage of the Smith-Lever Act
bring? to every American farm,
through the joint co-operution of the
Federal Government und the States,
the help of these agencies in solving
the business problems of the farmer.
COTTON FUTURES ACT: Deals
a death blow to gambling in this great
staple.
UNITED STATES WAREHOUSE
ACT: Enables owners of stored prod
ucts to obtain loans on warehouse
: receipt more nearly approximating the
fall value of the product.
.A GRAIN STANDARDS: A law en
acted last August authorizes the Sec
retary of Agriculture to establish offi
cial grain standards. This law is
workings The farmer who has been
robbed through Juggled grain grade
for years will appreciate its value.
CROP MOVING: The surplus funds
of the Treasury Department have been
placed directly in the banks of the
South and West to aid in moving crop

IMPROVED MARKETING SYS
TEM : The farmer, has for years felt
tne power of the market combine,
with its waste, Inefficiency and dis
honesty. The office of Markets and
the Rural Organisation Service, es
tablished in the Department of Agri
culture during this Administration, are
working on scientific lines to promote
better marketing and co-operative busi
ness organization among farmers.
These benefldent measures, with
many others, show why the fanner

were made at the homes of 2,436
families; 664 families said they
bought at home, 628 families
asked to be excused from an
swering questions. One thou

families said they bought more
or less outside the state, and
these families very kindly gave
the average amount of their out-of-the-
state purchases. From
each of 8 townships there were

of 20 townships there were
statements showing out-of-the-state
purchases running up to
$150 a year, and, in some instan
ces, on up to. $300 and $400 a
year. It is conservatively esti

be bought at a fair price within

they were patrons of itinerant
medicine peddlers. This county,
which is mentioned because it is ,
one of the best counties of the
state, has ten fair-sized towns.
Yet during the 12-month period
preceding the time when the out-of-the-state
buying test was
made, eight of these ten towns
lost in population, the county
seat being one of the losing num
ber. These figures may bear no
relation to each other, but here
is one fact the Kansas communi
ty builder should not overlook:
Every dollar spent in a business
way helps business in some
body's town. Every dollar spent
in a business way helps some--body's
town to grow. And here
is another fact to be remem
bered: The boy follows the dollar.-
The father buys in the city
to save money, s The boy goes to
the city to make money. The
community loses the dollar and
it loses the boy. Without the
dollar without the boy the
home community can not grow
and prosper. Kansas men and
Kansas women who love their
homes who love their boys
should think on these things.
