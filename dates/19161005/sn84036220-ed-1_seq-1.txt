JAPAN'S
PREMIER
Choosing Okuma's Suc
cessor Is a Victory for
the Army Party.
IS A MILITARY MAN
Japan's New Premier, Lieutenant Gen
eral Terauchi, Haa Always Been a
Military Man Almost Above Party
Questions, and for Some Time There
Has Been Considerable Agitation in
Japan in Pavor of His Elevation to
the Premier's Portfolio, Especially
by Those Who Want Vigorous Pol
icy Toward China.
TOKIO, Oct. 4—The resignation of
Premier Okuiua brought to a head
the Intense struggle between the bu
reaucratic forces and the udvocates
of a representative government, which
culminated in the victory of the bu
reaucrats by the emperor's designa
tion of fount Terauchi to form a
cabinet.
The selection of fount Terauchi
Is believed to be a victory for the
army party.
Premier Okumu aided Baron Kato
In his efforts to form a new ministry
and thus succeeded In amalgamating
the three groups composing the gov
ernment's majority in the house of
representatives into one great party.
By this move the new amalgamation
has the Selyukai, or conservative par
ty, in opposition and brings about a
two party political system in Japan
similar to that in the United States
and Great Britain. The movement
pleased the statesmen of the old
school who feared that it would be
undesirably progressive and was op
posed by Count Terouchi, whose slo
gan is a no-party form of government.
It is learned that Count Terouchi will
ask Baron Kato to support the new
party and thus effect u compromise.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4—Little is
known in official circles here as to
what policy Lieutenant General Te
rauchi, Japan's new premier, will
adopt. He always has been a mili
tary man almost above the jarty
questions, but In general he is re
garded as a follower In politics of
former Premier Yamagata, under
whose Influence "the gentlemen's
agreement,"' and other friendly ar
rangements were made with the Unit
ed States.
For some time there has teen con
siderable agitation in Japan in favor
of General Terauchi's elevation to the
,
premier's portfolio, especially by those
who felt former Premier Okuma's poli-i
cy was too favorable to western na- j
tions and too lenient to China. j
Terauchi frequently has been spoken |
of In the Japanese press as the "man j
of the hour," and his opponents have |
criticised him largely because of his !
belief in strict censorship of news, the j
importance he has attached to the ;
military party, and his aversions to |
politicians.
General Terauchi's greatest achieve- j
ment was the annexation of Korea, j
Made governor general in 1911, he j
waa instrumental in revolutionizing ;
the Korean policy of Marquis ito and ;
Viscount Sone, his predecessors. At |
the end of the first month in office !
he had secured police powers in Korea ■
for Japan; during the second he se-j
cured the right to garrison Japanese ;
troops there, and at the end of the !
month, the formal notification of the i
annexation of the territory was made ,
to the powers. He was given great
credit for having accomplished inis
without encountering a revolt anion;;
the Koreans.
General Terauchi was born in Slav
j
shu In 1852, was made sub-lieutenant!
in 1891, worked up through various i
military positions to supervision of the !
transport system during the Ch'nese'
war, became a lieutenant general In !
1897 aud later served as an inspector j
general of military instruction and vice I
chief of the general staff. In 1902 he j
became war minister in the Katsura \
cabinet, which position he held until
his appointment as governor-general |
of Korea nine years later -
ot Korea nine years later. j

IN WEST
President Is Noisily Re
ceived While on Way
to Talk in Omaha.
CONFERS WITHWALSH
At Every Stop Between Pittsburg and
Chicago, the President Appeared at
the Rear Platform of His Private
Car, Waved to the Crowds, Ex
plained He Was Making No
Speeches, and Then Shook Hands
With as Many as Possible—"I Am
Before the Jury and Can't Say Any
thing,'' He Explained.
CHICAGO, Oct. 4—President Wil
son, penetruting the middle west to
day for his speech in Omaha tomor
row, received noisy welcomes from
many thousand persons in Ohio, In
diana and Illinois. He interpreted
the enthusiasm to one crowd as
meaning "you believe in me.'' At
stop after stop tiic railroad stations
were packed at several places, bands
played and frequently the president
remarked on the cordiality.
Refusing to turn hta trip into a
speech making tour, the president
nevertheless kept up a running Bre
of remarks at every stop. Interest
among those who spoke to him cen
tered mostly about the eight-hour
law for railroad employes.
Mr. Wilson made a brief stay at
Chicago tonight and conferred with
Senator Walsh, in charge of democrat
ic western heudquarters, and other de
partment heads.
Several hundred persons, including
local politicians, railroad men and
not a few women docked to the train
yards and cheered the president when
he appeared and shook hands with
those nearest him.
Senator Walsh told him the cam
paign in the west "was more than
satisfactory.''
At every stop between Pittsburg,
p&ased early this morning, aud Chi
cago, the president appeared at the
rear platform of his private car,
waved to the crowds, explained that
he was making no speeches and then
shook hands with as many as pos
sible.
"I am before the jury and can't
say anything," was the way he ex
plained his failure to speak in several
towns.
"I am not making a speech-making
campaign." said the president at Lima
Ohio, "but it touches me and grati
fi es me very much to get the greet
ings I have all along the line; and
Ohio has certainly shown her hospi
tality."
"We did not want a speech; we
wanted to see our president," a man
called.
"i don't think much of my speech
| making, but I think it is better than
!l am to look at," Mr. Wilson said.
"We want to see Mrs. Wilson," a
man shouted.
j "I'll admit she is better worth look
; ing at than I am." replied the presi
; dent, as he brought his wife forward.
| "1 heard a republican say today that
! he was going to vote for you," a man
■ called out at Wooster, Ohio,
"He must be a good man," retorted
; Mr. Wilson.
! "You were with us in the eight
i hour day and we are with you," said
, a man at Orrville, Ohio, a railroad
town.
"Good," the president replied.
When tlie president stopped at Val
paraiso. Indiana, tonight, a crowd in
j eluding some students, drew him into
a r p, "rence to Mr. Hughes' whiskers,

A railroud brakeman, just off duty,
pushed out bis hand and said;
"Right there. President, she is dirty
but she's going to hit the rooster

At Warsaw, Indiana, the president
said:
"It cheers me very much to have

greeting because sometimes when I
am hard at work, I long very much
to get away and eonte out and see

OHIO'S HOSPITALITY.
LIMA, O., Oct. 4—President Wil

ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
With rain still keeping the op
erntions of the entente allies and Oer
mans on the western front In France
mainly to artillery duels, Interest In
the world wsr has been transferred
to tlie Russian, Rumanian and Mace
donian fronts, on all of which heavy
fighting is In progress.
The fierce battle which has been
raging for several days west of Lutsk
in Volhynln, Is still without decisive
result for either side, while In Galiclu
along Die Zlota Lipu river, where the
Russians are trying to push through
to Lemberg, Die Austro German forces
ure still holding. Berlin, in Its official
account of the fighting near Lutsk,
says the Russian dead number thou
sands.
Bucharest is still silent witli regard
to the operations of Rumania's troops
which crossed Die Danube river be
tween Husteliuk and Turtukai and In
vaded Bulgarian territory, hut Berlin
says these men have been hastily with
drawn in the fear of being encircled
by the forces of Field Marshal von
Mackensen.
Fresh gains by the Rumanians
against the center and left wing of the
Teutonic allies operating to the north
in Bobrudju are chronicled by Bueliar
esf. At Amzncea a position of tlie Teu
tons was captured and wilh it more
than t.OOO men and seven guns and
much war material.
in Transylvania from Orsova, on the
Danube, near the Hungurian-Rumanian
frontier, to the Hukowinn border, nu
merous engagements have been fought.
Bucharest claims successes for tlie
Rumanian arms in Die region of Odor
kim, between Eogarus and Sigliiscaru,
and in the mountains west of the River
Alt. It is admitted that tlie Rumanian
troops were withdrawn from the Jiu
valley but before falling back tliey
destroyed the coal mines at Petroseny.
The Berlin war office admits Die

Tahinos. In this latter region the
British have added to llieir front tlie
town of Jenikol.
An unofficial dispatch from Paris
says the Serbians in addition to de
feating the Bulgarians on Nize hill,
have captured the Kessali railroad
station. The Serbian territory cap
tured by the entente allies, says the
dispatch, now aggregates 230 square

SWEDEN'S
ATTITUDE
Will Remain Neutral if
Belligerents Will Al
low Her to Do So.
FIRST INTERVIEW
Sweden's Prime Minister Tells Cor
respondent of the Associated Press
That Whenever Sweden Has Taken
Any Step Displeasing One or An
other Belligerent Power Her Action
Have Been Made by Rumanians,
siderations of the Kingdom's Own
Necessities and Not for Any Parti
san Reason.
STOCKHOLM, Oct. I (via Loudon,
6 p. in ) "Sweden proclaimed her at
ilt ude of neutrality at the very out
I leak of tlie war. All her actions
since that time have borne out that
I rot-lumat ion, and all rumors or accu
sations Dial she hus done, or Intends
to do, anything inconsistent with this
attitude are due either to failure to
(omprehend her situation or to some
less credit able reason. And whenev
er ° v "den i :ih fr.ltre am step din
pleasing one or another belligerent
power her action has been dictated
solely by considerations of Die king
dom's own necessities and of Its fu
ture welfare, and not by nny parti
san reasons. We hope sincerely Dint
the belligerents will not make it Im
possible for us to miitntuln this at
titmlc unto Die end.
This in effect, is the declaration
of the prime minister of Sweden, Dr.
K. li. I,. IInmnuirskjold made to Die
correspondent of the Associated PreHS
in Die only interview he has granted
lo uny foreign journalist since Dm
war began.
Throughout the Interview Die pre
mler continued to lay stress on Ills
government's desires to follow un
swervingly the policy of unpartisau
shlp thus fur followed.
Tlie premier referred to certain
measures of the belligerent powers
mentioned in the official communica
tion Issued on Heplember 22, after
the conference of the Bcandinuvlnn
ministers at Christiania, particularly
tile destruction of neutml prizes at
sea, Interference with neutral ship
ping and the blacklist. Sweden finds
Itself In harmony with America in
its protest against this measure.
"The blacklist Is objectionable,"
said the premier, "not only because
of its present operation hut. because
It will affect tlie future of the vic
tims. We feel that It constitutes an
unJiiHt attempt to deprive ccrtnlu of
our citizens of their rights, and we
do not like to see any Swedish sub
ject lose any of his rights as a citi
zen unless by judgment of the courts.
"We are glad to know that the
United States has taken Hteps In this
matter and we have welcomed other
steps by that government in the de
fense of the rights of neutrals and
for Dm upholding of the rules of In
ternutlonal law 1 muy perhaps say
that already before our conference
nt Christiania we had striven to keep
feeling with the United States in re
gard to action In this direction.
"The Christiania communique lays
stress on the desirability of more
extensive collaboration of neutrals.
We hope that the traditional politics
of the United States will not prevent
It in the present exceptional circum
stances from Interesting Itself in such
collahoration.
"It Is hard for Americans to realize
our position," continued his excel
lency. "America lies so far away
from the scene of the conflict mid Is
so great and strong economically that
It has not yet seriously felt the re
sult of the war's Interference with its
normal activities. But the time will
come when America will feel it, too.
Just now the material advantages may
outweigh greatly the disadvantages
but it Is Impossible that the greater
part of Die rest of the world should
continue Indefinitely In the present
unnatural and chaotic condition with
out America suffering also.
"We In Sweden are suffering and
have been suffering these disadvan
tages almost from the start. Upon
what, In what manner, is our proper
industrial development to proened If
ivr pre 1-old *n rupplips nf materials
more or less arbitrarily fixed, and
at all events, Inadequate?
"Restrictions which are felt in com
paratively smull measure by the great
America can strike at our very vi
tals. We are couvinced that in our
situation Die Americans who appre
ciate as much as we do the indepen
dence of a country and the legal right
of its citizens, would feel and act ex
actly as we do."
Premier llammurskjod dismissed
lightly the whole crop of rumors
which spring up from time to tijne
to the effect that Sweden is on the
point of joining the war and dozens
of similar tales. 'When asked for
an explanation of these rumors, he re
plied clearly:
"Neurasthenia, or intentions that l
don't know.
