WALLACE FEUTZ got married at
4 o'clock in the morning. We knew
that Wallace was an "early bird" ond
that he was going to marry one of
Mexico's most accomplished and pop
ular girls, but we did not think he was
"afraid someone would steal his girl
before daylight" From what we can
guess, Wallace in his "younger
days" played pranks on some of his
friends and he was afraid there
would be "something doing" along
that line if he could be caught. Any
way, Wallace is a fine young fellow
and married a dandy girl. Wo are all
for him.
A MOVEMENT FOR
GOOD ROADS.
THE Audrain County Court, in an.
swer to petitions signed by taxpayers
from all parts of the county, have call
ed an election for the office of high
way engineer, to be submitted at tho
regular election the first Tuesday in
November. Many more than sufficient
names were filed to call the election,
and we believe the tax-payers gener
ally are now in favor of this move
ment. If we are going to have permanent
good roads and permanent bridges
and culverts, a good deal of real mon
ey is to be expended. When money
is expended on roads or any other en
terprise, it is important that someone
should be personally responsible and
have the work in charge. We consid
er the election of a highway engineer
would be a distinct step in the direc
tion of better roads for this county
and this ia he first step toward get
ting satisfactory results, the same as
other counties throughout the
State. Wo believe, after tnorougniy
examining the proposition, that the
ciizens of the county who are really
in favor of xpending money on our
roads (and that is the only way to per
manently improve them) will practl
cnlly in an unanimous way vote for
this proposition so that we can begin
at once to move in tho direction of
this much needed improvement.
The farmers of tho county are es
pecially interested in the improvement
of our highways. That's tho way to
get your produce to market easily, and
that's the way to make your form
lands advance in price. With rural
free delivery and pormanent good
roads, everybody will want to live In
the country instead of in the town.

JEALOUS NEGRO SHOOTS
L
Enraged by jealousy, George Jen
kins, a negro, shot and killed Lillie
Huffman, a negro girl at her
home in the northwest part of town
about two thirty o'clock Sunday af
ternoon. Jenkins, who was employ
ed by Sheriff J. W. Barnett, went to
the county jail, took a revolver be
longing to the sheriffn and borrowed
a horse from the sheriff, without ask
ing for either, and returned to the
girl's home. He entered the room,
in which a number of negroes were
seated and fired four shots at the
girl, two of which took effect, enter
ing her head, killing her almost in
stantly. When the smoke cleared
away, the only persons remaining in
the room were the dead girl and Jen
kins. Jenkins then returned to the coun
ty jail, replaced the revolver, stabled
the horse, and, being unable to find
the sheriff, who was away from the
jail at the time, started for town. On
his way he met Chief of Police Sam
Wallace, who had started to search
for him. Jenkins stopped the Chief,
saying: "I am the one you are look
ing for." He was placed in the city
jail and later taken by Sheriff Bar
nett to the County Jail.

NEW HAND GRENADE IS
LIKE A BASE BALL
WASHINGTON, Sept 29. Within
a short time the United States Army
will have what is likely to be the most
deadly hand grenade of any armies of
the world for use in trench and other
elose fighting'. It in a wonderful In
strument of warfare, invented by an
American army officer on duty at the
War Department. It is of the shape
and size of the ordinary "big league"
base ball. It is thrown exactly as a
base ball is thrown, and therefore can
be "placed with deadly accuracy."
The most marvelous feature about
the new grenade is that it can be han
dled with complete safety when not in
tended to deal destruction to the en
emy. Unlike the hand grenades now
in use in Europe, it will not explode,
no matter how far it drops to the
ground nor where it strikes, under or
dinary conditions.
In order to explode the grenade it is
thrown from the hand, just like a base
ball, with a curve, much as the famous
"spit" ball is thrown. Instead of the
bare hands, the thrower uses a small
instrument with which he holds in his
hand and retains there after the ball
is thrown. The sligtit twist given the
ball as it leaves the hand causes this
little instrument to set the plunger
in the grenade so that it explodes
when it reaches its destination. If
thrown in the ordinary way it will not
explode.
Army officers believe that the men of
this country, if need be, would devel
op into the best throwers of hand gre
nades in the world. The accuracy with
which base ball players throw long has
been the wonder of foreigners who
have watched the great American
game.

WITCH TALES OF FORMER DAYS
Early Missourians Believed in Witches; Some Tales of Witch
craft Told in Early Days.
: Little folks listen with wide eyes
and open mouths to tales of ghosts
and witches, but it was not very,
very many years ago that their eld
ers were equally credulous of the
gruesome tales told of the sinister
power of witches. Nowadays even a
child who gave credence to those
gruesome tales would be laughed at
Years ago a tribe of Shawnee In
dians settled in Missouri, induced to
come by the Spanish authorities at St
Louis. These people believed in
witches. Their belief was so strong
that any of their number accused of
being a witch was summarily execut
ed, burned at the stake. If one of
their braves saw a fox in the woods
and reported that he recognized in it
member of the tribe, the accused
member was immediately summoned
before the council and burned at the
stake.
But this superstitious belief was not
confined to the minds of the savage;
a large number of white inhabitants
of that period also held a belief in the
existence of witches. There once
dwelt in Missouri a man named Prine.
Now there was nothing peculiar about
Mr. Prine , but his wife was regarded
with awe by their neighbors, because
of the fact that, though she lived in
the swamp near the creek, she was
never subject to malaria, with which
her neighbors were almost lifelong
victims. One neighbor, Mrs. Gilbert,
one asked Mrs. Prine how it was that
she was always immuune from the ma
larial attacks; Mrs. Prine confided to
her that she was a witch and there
fore never sick and induced Mrs. Gil
bert to become a witch also. At the
appointed time Mrs. Gilbert went to
Mrs. Prine's home for the ceremony.
which was to relieve her of those ills
to which mere mortals are prey. Up
on entering the house she saw a giant
THE HOME TOWN
BY NELS
I know of a farmer living near a
town in Illinois who refused $400 an
acre for his land. His is a good farm
and yet there is just as good and pro
ductive soil on the Nile river. Farms
in that locality are practiccally off the
market Why? Because of their ap
proxjmity to a real wide-a-waka hriv
ing town. That town has excellent
sch ols, modern churches, stores that
are up-to-date, and that are giving
service.
The people appreciate these stores
they patronize them. They are
run by men who know how to buy
right sell right and advertise.
They meet competition through cor
rect methods. If some customers
wish cheap goods that are not quite up

negro standing in the comer of the
room. The negro stepped into the
room and, placing his left Band upon
the floor, palm up, commanded the
candidate for witchcraft to step on
it, then placing his other hand above
her head, said, "All that I hold between
my hands are mine." Mrs. Gilbert,
upon being thus ceremonially commit-.
ted, as she thought, to the devil, ex
claimed: "No, I belong to Jesus
Christ' This statement broke the
"spell," and it is presumed that Mrs.
Gilbert continued to suffer with the
chills and fever as of yore.
Several young men upon returning
from a party told of meeting a small
negro boy, who kept pace wih them
for some distance, becoming convinced
that something was wrong, they
spurred their horses into a run, but
the boy kept even with them, finally
leaping up behind one of the boys. The
boy looked back at his unwelcome com
panion, whereupon his face was drawn
to that side permanently, and ever af
ter he had the appearance of one who
had suffeded a stroke of paralysis.
One other tale of those times, is that
of the man who went hunting. He was
considered a good shot, but failed to
drop a spuirrel in several shots; he
became convinced that something was
wrong and, taking a dime from his
pocket, beat it into a silver bullet, and
shot the squirrel, which dropped, al
though he was unable to find the car
cass; you know even a witch cannot
withstand a silver bullet
A few hours later he was told that
a friend of his had been accidentally
shot in the shoulder. "He was the
squirrel I shot; he was bewitched and
I have broken the spell for him," re
marked the hunter.
Many other tales as improbable as
this were told and believed by even the
white inhabitants at that time.
DARLING
trade is appreciated. These stores are
giving service. That word, service, is
a summary of the standard for mea
suring the value of a man in a commu
nity. The person who appreciates servicj
will not buy groceries of a mail order
house and expects the local grocer to
make a quick delivery on telephone
call of something overlooked in giving
the regular order for the day's dinner.
The fair person will not ask the mer
chant to charge item after item until
quite a bill has run up, if the ready
money is being sent out of town to
the mail order house.
When you compare prices, do no:
overlook the cost and value of ser
vice. Mr. Farmer, if you are a regular
patron of these great catalogue hous
es, do not complain when you fail to
find in your local stores some parti
cular article you want Do not ask
for long credit when your crops are
short, and give the home dealer the
short end of your money when tho
crops are long.
