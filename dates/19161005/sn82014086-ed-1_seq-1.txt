Front Rain is Keeping the Operations of the Belliger
ents in France Mainly to Artillery Duels.
With rain still keeping the opera
tions of the entente allies and Ger
mans on the western front in France
mainly to artillery duels, interest in
the world war has been transferred to
the Russian, Rumanian and Macedon
ian fronts, on all of which heavy fight
ing is in progress.
The fierce battle which has been
raging for several days west of Lutsk,
in "Volhynia is still without decisive
results for either side while in Galicia
along the Zlota Lipa river where the
Russians are trying to push through
to Lemberg the Austro German forces
are still holding bsitk the Russians.
Berlin in its official account of the
fighting near Lutsk says the Russian
dead numbers thousands.
Bucharest is still silent with regard
to the operations of Rumania's troops
Which crossed the Danube river be
tween Rustchuk and Turtukai and in
vaded Bulgarian territory, but Berlin
says these men have been hastily
withdrawn in the fear of being en
circled by the forces of Field Marshal
Von Mackensen.
Fresh gains by the Rumanians
against the center and left wing of
the Teutonic allies operating to the
north in Dobrudj are chronicled by
Bucharest. At Amzacea - position

BRITISH INTEREST IN
FATE OF THE BREMEN

the United States.

val authorities here are manifesting
great interest In the fate of the Ger
man submarine Bremen, which some
time ago was reported to have sailed
for the United States and which they
say Js now greatly overdue. In dis
cussing the possible fate of the sub
marine Hner the naval authorities ask
Jf It la likely that she put into some
obscure American port. It is known
here that the Bremen was reported
while on her way to the United
States, but the last report of her
showed her to be T considerable dis
tance from the American coast.
In naval circles it is generally felt
that the German submarine Nimpaign
has again assumed serious propor
tions. In these circles the opinion is
expressed that Germany has after-war
as well as present conditions in view
In her destruction of tonnage and the
feeling is growing that Great Britain
soon will be compelled publicly to an
nounce a ton-for-ton policy as one of
the clauses in the peace treaty unless
Germany desists In sinking merchant
tonnage.

Great Britain in
Urgent Need of Men
FOR HER ARMIES AND FOR HER
MUNITIONS FACTORIES
CURTAIL EXEMPTIONS
On May 25 England Had 5,041,000 En
listed Men In July, August and
September the British Casualties
Were 307,169.
London, Oct. 4. 4.10 p. m. Great
Britain is in urgent need of men for
her armies and also for her munitions
factories. A statement to this effect
was given out today by the Man
Power Distribution Board, recently
appointed to comb out men jgible for
military, service in the United King
dom who have not yet been enrolled
in the army.
For Armies and Factories.
The board reported it had examin
ed officers of the admiralty, war of
fice, ministry of munitions and other
departments and that there was ur
gent need of fresh supplies of men
for the- armies and munition factories
in order to maintain our forces in the
field at the numbers already fixed for
them and at the same time to main
tain the supply of munitions essential
for their equipment and proper utili
zation. Curtailing Exemptions.
The' board, therefore, directed that
no exemptions be granted certain
classes heretofore exempt and that
there be a more general dilution of
skilled labor in munitions factories
with women and other workers here
tofore untrained. It suggested con
ferences of employers and employes
with a view to freeing skilled labor
now engaged in private work for em
ployment in munitions plants.
"It is essential," the report says,
"that a large part of the labor now
engaged in private work shall be di
verted to government orders or released
for the army."
Extended Use of Women.
The board also has under consider
ation the extended use of women and
of men over the military age and also
the use of men of military age now
employed in government offices. This
is the only means, the board says,
whereby extension of the age for the
compulsory service can be avoided.
No official figures have been given
recently as to the number of men
serving with the British army. On
May 25 King George, in signing the
military - service-IsiTrr-'plTrced the num
berraised. upto-Jhat-time at 5,041,
000. In July, August and September
the British casualties were 307,169.
