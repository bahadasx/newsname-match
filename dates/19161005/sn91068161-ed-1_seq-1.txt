COLORADO EDUCATOR SPEAKS
TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDEXTS
Advises TLeai to Get. a "Part 'of Their
Education in the West Instead of
East
Professor McLucas, Dean . of the
School of English in the University of

Hendersonville, visited the graded
school last Thursday morning.- He
talked to the high school in the audi
torium and then visited the-first and
the second grades.
In his talk to the hgh school stu
dents Prof. McLucas advised them to
get a part of their education in the
west rather than in the east. Not, he
said, that the schools of the west are
superior to those of the east, but be
cause of the broadening experience to
be gained by living with acosmopoll
tan people wno nt long since were on
the frontier where democracy is al
ways an ideal, and general progress is
rapid, it is better for the conserative
southerner to imbide the ideals of the
vest than it is for. him to add to his
conservatism from th schools of the
east. .
He said further that the (southerner
ought not to remain in the west, but
to come back to the South, inasmuch
as the South is by nature the greatest
section of this country. .

Hendersonville-AshevilL
; Surveys have been in progress for
some time from River Falfs S. C.; the
ern dailway, about 23 miles from
Greenville, S. C, northward ,towar-l
this city and Asheville, and it was re
ported that A. W. Jones of Henderson
ville and the J. G. White Engineering
corporation, 43 Exchange place. New
York city, were investigating the pos
sib-lity of constructing an electric
interurban railway to Asheville .from 1
xviver r ails, uisLaiiet? ol auuui uv
miles.
What would seem to be a mpre ra
tional view of the surveys is, that A.
G. Candler of Atlanta, who controls
the Greenville and Western railway,
which was formerly known as the
Greenville and Kncxville railway, is
considering and investigating thepos
sibility of extending up to Henderson-;
ville, as proposed some time ago, and
thence across to the Tennessee bound
ary to meet the eastward extension of
the Knoxville, Sevierville and Eastern
nail way. plans for the construction ot
which have just been announced,, at ;
Knoxville. It has always -been con-;
sidered that the Greenville and West-i
ern would be extended, and plans look--!n
to that end were published, sev

promises, through some independent
construction in Georg'a, to be con

J. L. Rose told a representative of tho
Citizen that there is renewed talk of an
interurban line between Spartanburg
and Hendersonville, and oh to Ashe
ville; and that there is a man in Hen
dersonville right now working on the
proposition.
Commenting on this the Citizen went
on to say: .
It is said that the entire success of
the motor transportation line this sea
son between Asheville and Henderson
ville has drawn the attention of capa
talists to the feas bility of such an in
terurban line between Asheville and
Spartanburg." The company operating

For many years" there has been taUr
of an interurban line from Asheville.
This talk has been "backed with the
expenditure of money, and at one time
it looked- as though the road might
actually be built. An Asheville man

for this Qity. He says:
"The commercial hotels of Ashe

they can care for. During the sum
mer the hotel facilities of the city are
taxed to their capacity. When this
Interurban line is finally built, as it
will be, the traffic to Asheville will be
greatly increased. Suppose the cars
should be operated on an hour's
schedule, leaving Spartanburg at some
convenient point and unloading pas
sengers in the center of this city. The
attractiveness Of the journey, and its
utter convenience would draw thou

would have a doubly beneficial effect."
Wh'le the Hustler has been aware of
jthe activities of engineers in this sec

could be secured. The men who are
doing the work are paid for it and of
course cannot make their instruction
public. However we are of the opinion
that such a line would pay handsomely
and see no reason why it should not be
built. ' - i !

UTT DEFENDS HIS
RECORD IN 0HGRESS
Spoke to Large Crowd in Court House
Here Monday Afternoon Fre
quently, Alplauded.
Henderson county Republicans fill
ed the court' room at the court house
here at 1 o'clock Monday, to -hear
Congressman James J. Britt, repre
seri'cative of "the Tenth congressional
district, defend his record" f or the
past two clears and tell what he ex
pects to do if re-elected to congress.
The crowd was enthusiastic, and the
speech was declared by many, to be
one of the iiest Mr. Britt has deliv
ered in the present campaign.
Mr. Britt told of his record in con
gress during the past two years and
said he had no apology to make for
any vote cast during those two years
at Washington. He declared that he ,
had represented . the people of tho '
Tenth district and rthat when party
lines interf erred WiWj free and. con
scientious action on hi part, he had
ignored party lines and had voted for
the cause which, in his opinion, was
to the interest of the people.
Mr. Britt waxed indignant over the
statements made by Congressman
Heflin at Asheville on sectionalism,
and declared that he (Mr. Britt) was
not raising the issue of sectionalism
in any respect. Mr. Britt declared
that he had always considered that
the United . States is one country and
that he not only was not raising the
issue of sectionalism himself, but thati
no one else was raising it with his
consent or permission in this cam
paign. Henderson county is said to be. one
of Mr. Britt's strongest points in the
district, and he was given a generous
round of applause at the end of his
speech and was interrupted frequently
by applause.

After several years' of patient suf
fering George William Hefner passed
to that rest of the Children of God,
September 12.. 1916. At the age of
thirteen he became a Christian, united
with the Pleasant Hill Baptist Church,
and thenceforth walked so consistently
after the example of the Master that
his life was a source of inspiration and
a. positive power wherever he was
known, but. was most helped in his
home community.
When twenty-one years of age he
married Miss Rosa Patterson, who with
the r three ' little daughters, have the
sympathy of a multitude of friends as
they mourn so great a loss. '
The life that has ceased to be here
was one that' chose the good and re
fused the evil, and in turn bestowed
that good on either side of the pathway
of life. -Here among us it was a grand
and shining light: gone, we pause' and
meditate on its gentle purity, and out
of the gloom of our imperfections we
look toward that day when we shall
see this l.fe bearing its "Crown of
Righteousness" from the Hand of
the Righteous Judge. As we look m

- "To . begin with I'm supporting Wil

Wall street is against Wilson.
"I'm for Wilson because he is 'on to
,xx xxx vx uoio vu; uxioix xxcxxxvxo Lxx(t ' '
Seek to, control government and is '
holding them off. That he is on .to';:
them and is holding them off is prov
ed by nis refusal to rush into war
with Mexico, sacrificing the lives of
thousands of young Americans to save
the dollars that Wall street has in
vested in. Mexico on a gamble. " v
. "For this one reason alone the na? .
tion is under an obligation to return
Wilson to the White house.
"But for purely business reasons,
wa;cu may appeal more airecuy j
many men, the welfare of the country
demands Wilson's re-election. The
Republicans are raising a great roar
about the eight-hour low and how it
will hamper business. v
"I say and I speak from experi
ence, not from guess work that the
eight-hour law will help business.
"The emplbjf&rs . of the country
should be as enthusiast.cally behind
Wilson in his advocacy of the eight
hour day as the workers, and they
would be if they knew their business.
For employers who are hostile to the
eight-hour day do not know their
business. .
'We have had "the eight-hour day-in
force in the Ford factory for. three
years, and we have made more monejr
each succeeding year under it. It' has.
proved its own merit.
"Republicans are arguing that when.
the war ends all our prosperity will
cease -unless we 'have,,a Republican
in (the White house.
"I deny first that war is responsible
for the present prosperity. The FOrd.
cqmpany has not taken a dollar of war
contracts has refused them time af

grown constantly and we are now-
200.Q0G cars behind orders. ' t
- ' -The business of theT United States
todav" has a-momentum that no.; man.

"As for the tariff, which Republi

to say .that the tariff is nothing but a-
hothouse remedy. It may jnake bus
iness sprout for a little whilej but its
effect is artificial and it can . never
produce a hardy, permanent business
plant.
"If we cannot compete on even:
terms with any country on earth, then
we ought to quit. There is absolute-:
ly no necessity for hard times. There
is enough in this world to do for
everybody, and this country always
will find enough to do if the interests
and Wall street will keep hands off
and not rob .the many and enrich the
few.
"I believe the President Lit the nail
on the head in a recent speech when
he said :
j "'The relations of capital and labor
must, be regarded as a human rela
t tionship of men with men. Labor
must be regarded as part of-the gen

going to make for the success of busi
