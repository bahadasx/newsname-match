$2 WHEAT PREDICTED
BEFORE JANUARY 1ST
CHICAGO, Oct. 5. Graiiimen predict two dollar
-,heat before January first. Today's prices, both cash
and futures, range ten cents lower than the records of
January, 1915.
Heavy crop decreases, discouraging Argentine condi
tions and the allies demands for Canadian and Australi
an wheat, caused the price boom. The Board of Trade
stated that the Northwest has no seed wheat Present
seed wheat prices are four and seven dollars a bushel.
Grainmen are seriously discussing the importation of
Canadian wheat for seeding. Agricultural experts are
investigating to ascertain whether Canadian wheat is
adapted to United States cultivation.
Cash wheat dealers said the Northwestern farmers
were "determined not to sell under two dollars a bushel.
Grain receipts from other primary shipping points are
lighter.
Millers said flour continues steadily rising as a result
of wheat conditions. Chicago quoted special brands to
day at nine dollars and ten cents a barrel wholesale.
Board of Trade members said speculation was not re-
sponsible for the present high' prices. They declared
open trading prevented the big elevator men from corner
ing the supply and boosting the prices still higher.
Produce prices are closely following grain. Potatoes,
eggs, butter and poultry soared. Dealers said bad wea
ther caused a potato shortage and the hot summer dam
aged poultry.
No lower prices are possible this winter, unless the
government prohibits the exportation of foodstuffs.

"The young people of eastern and
southern Oregon are Just as eager to

of the Willamette valley, but they
cannot well go to the normal school
unless the normal school Is brought

they could do was to pour water into
