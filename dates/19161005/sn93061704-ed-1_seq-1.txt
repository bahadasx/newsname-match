The new bell has arrived and is in
stalled; The bell has a thirty-two inch
base, weighs 680 pounds. It has a very
fine tone and will go far toward aiding
the punctuality of the children.
The new ceilings are all in place and
the painters will finish their work this
week. The ceilings were given two
coats of "ivory" paint, which blends
nicely with the walls and woodwork.
The Girls' Basket-ball Club'oiganized

Hazel Doyle, president; Lois Hollon,
vice-president; Josephine Capt, secre
tary; Lorene Dyer treasurer. There
will be enough girls for twe teams and
we expect some lively contests during
the winter.
Judge Fuller, of the board ef Educa

last week. The Judge gave some very
interesting talks in the different de
' partments. He has promised a chalk
talk for the little folks on his next
visit.
R. R. Archer, of the Albuquerque
Morning Journal, was a pleasant visi
tor at the High School on Tuesday of
tiis week
Mrs. Mulvaney, one of Torrance
county's wide-awake teachers was a
pleasant visitor last week.
The attendance and punctuality has
been remarkable thus far. Let us hope
it ma continue for the full nine
months. Let us urge the parents to
keen their clocks regulated and see
that the children have plenty of time
t) reach school before the opening
hours. School opens at 9 a. m. and
1:15 p. m. (Railroad time.)
Report cards for the pupils of the
grades will be given out on Monday of
next week. The teachers request that
the parents examine these reports care
fully and if anything in the reports is
not satisfactory we would be glad for
your help and co-operation in bringing
your child up to the standard.
At the end of each month on Honor
Roll will be published in the Independ
ent. The names of all who have been
neither absent nor tardy during the
month will appear, and when the pupils
once understand this they will be on
the lookout each month for their
names.

Ninety Dollars per
Acre from Potatoes
C. S. Killough was in town Tuesday
of this week with a wagon load of po
tatoes which he grew on his farm, ten
miles north of Mountainair and just
east of Manzano. He had about a half
acre of these, the crop being about
3,000 pounds. This brought him at tha
rate of ninety dollars per acre, which
is not bad for ten dollar land. The
larger potatoes weigh from one to two
pounds each. They are of fine flavor
and firm texture, and of better keep
ing qualities than the irrigated potato.
He found ready market for the whole
load.

SH'duKaST WEEK
Twelve Cars of 40 Q0 Pounds Each Billed
Out by Santa . , Agent Copeland
Shipments Just Beginning
to Move
Although the shipment of beans has
just started, the first car having been
billed from the local station on Sep
tember 30th, the vicinity is twenty-five
thousand dollars richer on account of
the shipment of twelve cars, the last
of which was billed out onTuesday af
ternoon, October 3rd. The first car
brought right around two thousand dol
lars and those shipped more recently
have brought more, making the total
omething over $25,000.
Last year there wore shipped from
Mountainair thirty-eight cars of beans
during the season, so that in the first
week's shipment this year, almost one
third of the total number of cars have
been, shipped that were loaded a year
COUNTY AGENT HARWELL
Of BOYS AND GIRLS AT THE BIG
STATE FAIR AT ALBUQUERQUE
Expresses Gratitude to Car
Possible by Generously
The Torrance County section of the
Boys' and Girla' Club Camp at the
State Fair seemed to get more than
their share of enjoyment. At almost
any hour of the day the children could
be found talking and laughing while
taking in the Fair's activities from in
front of a booth, sitting in the grand
stand, or witnessing the performance
of some street fakir. The whole week
passed without incident to mar the
pleasure of a single individual. Cap
tain Toulouse together with the whole
Extension force set about to do every
thing possible that would add one little
clement of pleasure for the children.
Ail privileges of the Fair were open to
the wearers of the club work insignia,
grand stand and all. They wera taken
repeatedly to picture shows and other
down town pleasures by those in charge
of the camp.
Our reputation as a County was one
of order and happiness. Miss Anna
Porter forever gained the respect and
love of the children by her kindness
and consideration. Other delegations
were more than glad to have opportun
ity of being placed under her care. Mr.
Burt made a decided hit and was on
the job every minute seeing that all
went well and that the children enjoy
ed themselves, The County Agent
looked after the more serious parts of
the program in arranging transporta
tion and exhibits. The county had the
largest delegation, really many more
than were allowed on paper, and it re
quired nerve to appear on the scene
with the multitude that the nine autos
took oTer. Since all of the children
who went deserved the trip, and in as
much as we had no representation last
year, Captain Toulouse looked at the
matter in a broad way and we all got
safely inside.
The auto owners who furnished the
transportation free deserve all manner
of credit. Without them our delegation
would have been limited and many a
little one left home who had worked
hard for the trip. Those who made
the trip both ways especially for the
children aside from Mr. Burt and Mr.
ago. Four more cars are now loading,
with orders for still more cars on file.
The stories of some of the bean
growers read almost like the Bret
Harte tales of mining, with the dif
ference that the amounts netted are
not in such large sums, but are repeat
ed 'of tener and more people benefitted.
On the 22d day of March, 1916, Milton
C. Robbins bought the improvements
on 71 acres of land, some seven miles
north of Mountainair, and filed a home
stead thereon. He got busy and plan
ted a crop of beans. He has harvested
his crop and is the richer by twelve
hundred dollars than he was last March.
In other words for a trifle over six
months work,, he has received $1200
wages.
WRITES
Owners Who Made the Trip
Donating Use of Cars
Harwell, were Mrs. Mathews, Mr. Bur
ton, Mr. Marchant, Mr. McGillivray,
ana mr. reterson. Mrs. Mathews re
sponded to the call at once and offered
the use of the Dodge car. The others
were equally on the job and could see
pleasure in giving the kids a good time
Even with this number of cars the
space for the children and baggage was
limited and others who were making
the trip waited for the start and made
room. Among these liberal people
were Mr. Elgin, Mr. Dillon, Mr. Al
man, Mr. Kemp and Mr. Garvin.
People cirectly interested in club
work see in the trip success from every
angle. The children were offered the
best opportunity for enjoyment that
the State furnishes. Club work will
continue along the same lines and all
club woikers may expect a reasonable
rewaru lor their etlorts while preparing
themselves to become good men and
women and a credit to their nation
which stands behind the work.
State winners as yet can not be an
nounced since records and stories must
be gone over at tho Agricultural Col
lege. ' Roland Harwell, County Agent.
Commendation
In this connection it is only fair to
extend congratulations to Torrance
county for winning first prize in the
dry farming county contest. Torrance
county is a community that has had
the never say ?.a spirit. The county
has had some mighty lean years and
the people have had to contend with
man discouraging things.
But the farmers who persisted in
Torrance county are riding in automo
biles now and letting the bean erops
pay for the gasoline. Dry farming in
a systematic manner has been the ral
vation of Torrance county. The coun
ty is now on its way to permanent
prosperity. The farmer is prepared
to withstand a bad year, if one comes
along, and to make the most of the
food years. Albuquerque Herald.

70,000 Pounds and
Half Through Threshing
F. Q. Imboden has been bringing in
beans this week, which he is shipping,
having sold a portion of his crop. When
asked concerning his crop, he said "We
have threshed seventy thousand pounds
and have as many more to thresh."
Mr. Imboden's farm is north of Moun
tainair, in the Mesteña.
fractures Collarbone
Geo. V. Hanlon was thrown from a
motor cycle in Albuquerque last Satur
day night and hia collar bone was frac
tured. Mrs. Hanlon was with him in
Albuquerque at the time on her way to
the meeting of the Womens Club
at Las Vegas. She wrote that in
all probability she would be compelled
to give up the trip to Las Vegas and re
man wth Mr. Hanlon.
Broken Jaw Healing Nicely
W. II. Burns has so far recovered
from the effects of the accident sus
tained some four weeks ago, in which
he received a broken jaw, when he be
came mixed up with a well drill, that
Dr. Buer removed the wires from the
injured member the first of the week.
Appearances now indicate that Mr.
Burns will shortly be as "good as new,"
much to his own delight as that of his
friends. A diet of soup for a month
has become rather monotonous to him,
as he has not been accustomed to
"keeping his mouth shut" so long at a
time.
Pilchard at the Wines
Col. G. W. Prichard of Santa Fe.was
in Mountainair Monday on business
connected with the mines in Abo Can
on, in which he is interested. He. has
fitted up an office at the mines, and is
preparing to furnish a house and make
his home there at least a portion of the
time. He has good reports of the mineB,
the ore now being taken out being of
good grade and paying well.
MOUNTAINAIR BOYS
GROW PRIZE BEANS
Walter Hoyland Leads with a
Score of 95. Ora Hollon
Second
FIRST AND SECOND IN
STATE WIDE COMPETITION
Torrance County Bunch Best Be
haved of All at Camp
Southard
The Mountainair boys who attended
the State Fair came back covered with
honor, Walter Hoyland having won
first over all competitors in the state
with a score of 95. Ora Holland was a
close second, receiving second honors
in the state. Before the judging was
begun, there were six entries from
Torrance county and three from other
portions of the state, against which
our boys had to compete.
Superintendent Burt is high in his
praise of the bunch of Torrance county
boys and girls of which he and Miss
Porter had charge. He claims they
were the best behaved bunch on the
grounds, that they gave strict atten
tion to everything, and profited greatly
by the trip. He said he greatly enjoy
ed the outing with the youngsters, who
proved ladies and gentlemen through"
out the week.
The whole bunch of almost three
hundred boys and girls were represen
tative of the best of the state. They
had won their honors by application
and attention and hard work and natur
ally there wasn't a drone in the whole
lot. Of course they were full of life
a boy that isn't never wins honors in
such a class anyhow. But they are
learning to apply this life to practical
and useful things, which is the impor
tant thing after all. Instead of smoth
ering their energy with "don'ts" these
young people are learning to utilize it
to advantage in doing. A boy who can
grow more beans or a better pig than
his dad will make a better farmer and
a better citizen in years to come. And
the girl who can care for a flock of
chickens and secure greater results in
eggs and profits will make a better
wife for these better farmers.
State fair Notes
In the judging of beana at the State
Fair, County Superintendent Burt
learned that the beans exhibited by the
boys from Torrance county were shown
just as they had been threshed, while
those shown by competitors had been
hand-picked. Together with County
Agent Harwell, he made a protest and
proving his point, the matter was rec
tified. It is only fair to the boys that
the competition should be on an equal
basis, and so it was adjusted.
