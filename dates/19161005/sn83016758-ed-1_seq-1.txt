VISIT BROWNSVILLE
Numerous Officers and Men of Third
Regiment Visit Texas City
Over the Week End.
"Mike" Sends Another Breezy Letter
Anent Company and Con-
ditions on the Border.
Nothing outside of the regular rou
time has happened the past week ex
cept that our band has received instru
ments and the members are practicing
several hours daily to make up for
lost time. We think they are already
the equal of the other bands and give
promise of being as good as the origi
nal Third Minnesota band, which had
the undisputed reputation of being the
best in the northwest. There is con
siderable rivalry between the different
regiments as to the relative merits of
their bands.
It is just as hot as it was in July
and August and the natives inform us
that it will remain so for about two
months more. The nights, however,
are somewhat cooler and requisitions
have been made for extra blankets and
overcoats, but we probably won't use
the latter until we get home. We have
not had rain for ten days and a shower
to settle the dust would be acceptable.
Forty recruits arrived in camp Mon
day, of which company received
one, Walter Hague, of Minneapolis.
He didn't increase the size of the com
pany any as Clair Newton and Nimrod
Hanson, buglars, were transfered to
the band that day. We would wel
come about fifty more as there is a
certain amount of work to be done
and the more men the easier it is for
each man.
Blanks have arrived to be filled out
by men still in the service, with de
pendent relatives, for their share of
the $2,000,000 appropriation by con
gress for that purpose. They will re
ceive $20 for a wife and $10 for each
child up to three, making a maximum
of fifty dollars a month. This will be
a considerable help to those who were
not fortunate to get a discharge
when tl rule was in force.
All close order drill has been dis
continued and combat exercises or
rifle practice every morning at 7:00 to
10:30 a. m. has taken its place. All
kinds of battle problems are worked
out, attacks, entrenchments, outpost
duty with the enemy trying to get
through our lines. The enemy is rep
resented by another battalion with
white bands around their hats. One
man sneaked through our line by hid
ing in a civilian's wagon. We are get
ting well acquainted with mesquite
and other thorny brush as all our ex
ercises are heldin the thickest of it,
but prefer that to close order drill as
it isn't so monotonous.
Hundreds of officers and enlisted
men avail themselves of half fare
excursions on week-ends to Browns
ville and points on the gulf. Browns
ville has a population of about 15,000,
of which about 75 percent are Mexi
cans. The streets are narrow and un
pa\ed, and the buildings are old and
built after the ancient Mexican style
of architecture. It is situated on the
Rio Grande, a bridge connecting it
with Matamora, a large Mexican
town. Strangely enough it has never
been bothered by bandits but was, it
will be remembered, shot up by some
drunken United States soldiers about
two years ago. Villa's first big battle
was fought at Matamora, in which he
is said to have lost a thousand men.
United States soldiers are not allowed
to go any further than the middle of
the bridge, where a stone is placed,
marking the international boundary,
and is guarded by a United States
soldier on one side and a Mexican on
the other.
One incident illustrative of the low
value of Mexican money occurred at
one of the curio stands of which there
are dozens. A Mexican boy who lived
in Mexico and had earned a few cents
in Brownsville shining shoes, etc.,
tendered a U. S. 25 cent piece and
asked for Carranza currency. He was
given five dollars for his quarter and
started home with it. The dealer ex
plained that he could buy more for
the five dollars in Mexico than he
could for his quarter here and this
plan is practiced by many of them.
About 15,000 troops are stationed
there and the merchants are now do
ing an immense business.
I We understand that it has been re
ported in Princeton that there is a
great deal of malaria here. There is
but there is no cause for anxiety for
relatives as there are no serious cases.
Most of the patiens are able to walk
around. We are now being given daily
doses of quinine as a malaria pro
phylactic and no cases hare been re-
^MOk^M% MtM^h^huk \*:&fc~ iis
ported recently. Mosquitoes are given
as the cause of the disease.
The company wishes to express its
thanks for the donations sent us. The
money is being carefully expended
and a strict account kept of every
item.
Lieutenant Kalkman writes from
Harlingen, where he is now stationed,
that he is learning to ride and play
polo, which is a favorite sport among
the officers and cavalrymen.
Grover Umbehocker, who has been
laid up with a swollen knee, is slowly
improving.
A dance for the officers was held
in their mess hall Wednesday evening,
A number of school teachers form
Mercedes and some of the officers'
wives who are living in Mercedes were
present. Music was furnished by a
part of the band.
An Indiana battery arrived early
this morning to take the place of the
university battery sent home.
It is said that General Funston is to
review the troops of this district next
week, after which he will select sev
eral regiments to be sent home. All
are hoping that theirs will be one of
the lucky ones. MIKE.
Anent Telephone Companies.
The Minnesota Railroad and Ware
house commission is face to face with
a somewhat puzzling situation in the
rural telephone field. Of late there
has been brought to the attention of
the commission from various parts of
the state a condition that requires im
mediate remedy and which the per
sons involved look to the state for
aid.
The condition arises from the fail
ure of the companies in the first in
stance to adopt a schedule of rates
that would carry their burdens. The
situation is very similar to the one
that the fraternal insurance orders
were called upon to face some years
ago and which all but disrupted some
of them. In order to make their in
surance departments attractive cer
tain orders adopted a set of rates
which later proved inadequate. The
inevitable result was that they were
compelled to raise their rates not only
high enough to meet the obligations
of the order but to cover the deficien
cies of the period of low rates. The
only other alternative was a dissolu
tion of the order and the partition of
the assets among the members of good
standing. The majority raised the
rates and gradually are getting on
their feet again.
In like manner scores of rural tele
phone companies in Minnesota and of
course elsewhere fixed their rates
without regard to the dayof reckoning.
No provision was made for deprecia
tion or to meet obligations. The sub
scribers obtained of course telephone
service at a very moderate figure and
were pleased accordingly. But the fu
ture is not so bright judging from
many of the communications received
by the Railroad & Warehouse commis
sion.
An instance is furnished by a tele
phone concern with a plant valued at
about $25,000.00 and serving *450 sub
scribers in one of the best known
farming sections of the state. The
secretary of the company writes that
the plant has about outlived its use
fulness and unless reconstructed the
cost of maintenance will be in excess
of the earnings. It is suggested that
the commission make an investigation
of the entire situation, including an
examination of the books and an in
spection of the plant, and propose a
table of charges that will be fair to
all concerned. Otherwise, writes the
secretary, the company will be
wrecked, the subscribers deprived of
their telephone service and the stock
holders liable for assessments to liqui
date the obligations of the company.
"This is an unfortunate condition,"
said a member of the Railroad and
Warehouse commission, "but we are
quite helpless. We can send men out
to make investigations with a view of
ascertaining the reasonableness of
rates, but hardly to advise local corn-*
panies what rates to charge. Such a
duty was not contemplated by the leg
islature and the amount of the legis
late appropriation for the mainten
ance of the newly created telephone
department would preclude any such
action."
"Telephone companies should obtain
rates to cover operating expenses,
taxes and the maintenance of the
property in serviceable condition. It
is the duty of the officers to see that
this is done. The duty of the state is
to see that excessive rates are not
charged, that no discrimination or
other unlawful practices are engaged
in and that a reasonable service is
provided. We are~ advised that there
are numerous instances of a similar
nature. The plants that were installed
ten and twelve years ago, in many

instances, are now almost obsolete
through lack of repairs and must be
entirely reconstructed or discarded,
but is is up to the companies them
selves and not to the state, to see that
this is done."
A County Road System.
Eventually every county in Minne
sota will have a complete network of
good graveled roads, connecting with
more permanent arterial highways.
It is obviously wise to build the whole
system at the earliest possible date,
so that the people can use the roads
while they are paying for them, and
thus get the benefits of increased land
values, larger population and more
community life now, instead of wait
ing for a generation.
The first cost of a complete road
system seems rather staggering. Ac
cordingly, the county authorities, in
stead of building a road right to start
with, have frequently frittered away
money on "improvements" that must
be done over and over again. Under
present conditions many farmers have
a just complaint. They say that State
funds are spent chiefly on arterial
roads, while the farmers' tonnage is
limited to what he can haul on the
poor "feeder" road to the trunk line
highway. Trying to "improve" these
feeders, the local authorities continue
to spread the road money out too
thin to get permanent results.
Hennepin county has the chance to
make itself a "demonstration tract"
for Minnesota and the northwest. The
county has some good arterial roads
already, and could easily finance a
complete road system that would soon
demonstrate its value in dollars and
cents.
The State Highway commission has
found that, when a road has to be
made from nothing, a twenty-four
foot roadway with sixteen feet well
graveled costs from twenty-five hun
dred to three thousand dollars a mile.
Such roads make good trunk lines, and
many miles of them are in use al
ready.
The maximum cost of such roads
for a complete network in any coun
ty is easy to figure. Roads a mile
apart each way mean two miles of
road for each section of land, which
figures out at eight or nine dollars
road cost for each acre. But some
roads are already in, and most of the
lateral roads do not need to be so
wide or so heavily surfaced. Com
bined state and federal aid in the next
few years will build many more miles
of trunk line road.
Thus a rural county system radiat
ing from these trunk lines could be
financed at a cost of less than five
dollars an acre, especially if the work
is done as a connected project by the
use of modern labor-saving machinery.
This cost would be spread over a term
of years, through bond issues.
That such roads would add at least
ten dollars an acre to land values is
shown by experience. They would
mean to any county more farmers,
higher assessed valuations, better
Schools and better home conditions.
Hennepin county would make no
mistake by becoming the pioneer in
Minnesota, in establishing a complete
county road system. Minneapolis

Stark-Reinord.
A pretty marriage was solemnized
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Rei
nord in Milo, when their daughter*'
Miss Ethel, became the wife of Mr.
Andrew Stark. Rev. M. Peterson of
the Princeton Swedish Lutheran
church performed the ceremony, in the
presence of about a hundred invited
guests.
The bride was attired in a gown of
cream colored satin draped with chif
fon, and carried cream colored roses
and lilies of the valley. The brides
maids were Misses Esther Reinord
and Agnes Stark. The former wore
a dress of crepe de chine and the lat
ter one of pale blue silk. Both car
ried bouquets of carnations. Messrs.
William Stark and Arvid Lind attend
ed the groom.
At the conclusion of the ceremony
a bounteous wedding dinner was paiv
taken of by those in attendance.
The bride and groom are estimable
and popular young people, and that
their wedded life will be one of unin
terrupted bliss is the wish of all who
know them. Mr. and Mrs. Stark will
reside on a farm in Milo.
Foote-Minks.
Mr. Sidney S. Foote and Miss Rose
E. Minks were united in marriage by
Rev. M. Peterson last Thursday. The
groom is a prosperous and progressive
young farmer, and the bride is a
young lady of charm and pleasing
ways. Mr. and Mrs. Foote will reside
on the groom's farm. Numerous
friends extend felicitations.

POTATO JITUATM
Local Market FirmerReceipts Are
Light But the Quality of the
Potatoes is Improving.
No Potatoes Being Stored at This
PointOther Interesting Facts
Anent Spud Situation.
The local potato market is firmer
and from 90c to 95c is being paid for
tubers. The upward trend set in
Tuesday.
Local buyers report that receipts
are light, but the quality is improving.
Late potato digging is well under
way which accounts for the improved
quality.
No potatoes are being stored at this
point, and buyers ship as soon as a
carload is secured. Thus far this sea
son 70 carloads have left the Prince
ton depot. Local buyers estimate that
between three and four carloads a day
are now being marketed here.
The Red River Valley section is well
started with the digging, and the qual
ity is reported as being very good.
Dakota is shipping freely now, and the
quality is very satisfactory. Dakota
is newer as a potato growing state,
and much of the acreage is on virgin
potato lands, free from disease and
containing all the elements necessary
for the production of a good uniform
crop.
Reports from Chicago show that
eastern stock commands the best
prices on the market. Minnesota
stock has commenced coming fairly
good there, but most of the Wisconsin
potatoes offered there have been un
satisfactory.
The Greely, Colorado, potato district
is "coming back." This district for
merly produced thousands of carloads
of potatoes of the highest grade. But
the "blight," or something else, got
the matter with the tubers and the
production dwindled until there was
mighty little left of the rich and prof
itable potato industry. In 1904 with
in 15 miles of Greely 14,000 cars were
produced in a year. In 1911 this dis
trice lost 40,000 acres of potatoes and
for three years more potatoes planted
wero a failure. The state and federal
governments tailed in their most
learned specialists in an effort to dis
cover the cause of the mysterious
retrogation, but none were able to make
the soil produce as before. The res
toration has been almost as myster
ious as the retrogation. Anent this
Prof. C. L. Fitch, the famous potato
specialist of Ames, Iowa, College of
Agriculture, says: "If I am not
greatly mistaken, here is a lesson that
all potato districts, however proud and
wherever in the country they are lo
cated, can well take to heart. Do not
overwork potato producing land nor
a potato producing district."
Village Council Meets.
The village council met in regular
session last evening. Mayor Newbert
presided and Councilmen Gottwerth
and Ross, and Recorder Cravens were
present.
Reading of minutes of last meeting
was, on motion, dispensed with.
On motion duly made, seconded and
carried T. M. Olsen was appointed a
member of the council to fill the va
cancy created by the death of the late
J. A. Smith. Mr. Olsen is a young
man of excellent judgment, and will
undoubtedly prove a valuable member
of the council.
Chas. King, who has been acting as
village marshal, and making good, ap
plied for appointment to the position.
The application was favorably acted
upon. It was decided to instruct Mr.
King to see to it that the laws govern
ing the sale and smoking of cigarets
are strictly enforced.
Gust Hofflander made application
for a cigaret license, and L. F. Wilkes
applied for a transfer of the cigaret
license of Sturdevant Bros, to himself.
Both applications were granted.
A resolution was adopted providing
that hereafter the Australian ballot
system should be used at village elec
tions in Princeton. The plan provides
that candidates must file with the vil
lage recorder at least two weeks be
fore election. The filing fee is $1.00.
The names will, of course, all be upon
one ballot, arranged alphabetically.
This will be a decided improvement
over the old system.
A tax levy for 1917 was then made,
and it was decided to raise $9,000, di
vided into the following funds: Elec
tric and water, $2,100 general, $3,-
400 roads and bridges, $3,500.
It was decided to put in a block of
sewer along Oak street between Ply
mouth and Central avenues (from
Northwestern hospital west a block),
and five catch basins and a man hole
will also be put in.
Every spring, it appears, that the
premises of Mrs. Whiting, at the cor
ner of street and Third street, are
flooded with water. The council de
cided to see what could be done in the
way of affording relief.
It was decided to instruct the Water,
Light, Power & Building commission
to pipe steam from the power, plant
to jail for heating purposes.
After acting on a grist of bills the
council adjourned.
The Anoka Fair
Our Anoka neighbors had two fine
days for their fairFriday and Sat
urday of last week. There was a
goodly sprinkling of Princeton and
Spencer Brook folk on the grounds
Friday afternoon, and they were af
forded an opportunity of witnessing
several closely contested trotting
races. There is only one thing in
which the Anoka fair grounds excel
those of Princetonthey have a much
better race track.
The display of vegetables and farm
products generally, especially pota
toes, was excellent. The new agricul
tural hall, which was erected largely
through the generosity of Senator
Swanson, is a fine, roomy building,
and the only criticism we would offer
is that provision should be made for
a little more daylight.
The displays made by the farmers'
clubs, spoke volumes for the thrift and
enterprise of Anoka farmers and their
wives and daughters.
There were some good cattle and
horses on exhibition but not enough
of them. A rich and old settled coun
ty like Anoka should make a better
showing of live stock.
All in all it was a good fair, away
and by far ahead of that of a year
ago. More permanent buildings and
a larger grand stand are needed, and
they will be forthcoming by another
year, for the Anoka fair is growing
in public favor.
Anoka has a bunch of hospitable,
whole-souled entertainers, and at the
head of the list stands big-hearted
John Coleman and his estimable wife
and family.
Louis Lessard.
Louis Lessard, sr., an old and re
spected citizen of Greenbush, passed
away at the home of his daughter,
Mrs. T. Sr Corteau, Saturday after
noon.
Funeral services were conducted at
St. Edward's Catholic church Tuesday
morning at 10 o'clock. The attendance
was large and Rev. Fr. Willenbrink
officiated. Relatives and friends from
Minneapolis, Duluth, Rush City, Os
seo and Bruno were among those who
attended the obsequies. Interment
was in Oak Knoll cemetery.
Deceased, who was a native of Can
ada, was born on August 8, 1842. He
accompanied his parents to the United
States in 1860 and the family located
at Osseo. Shortly after coming to
Minnesota, the subject of this sketch
left for the Pacific coast, where he
passed 18 years. After his return to
Osseo he was united in marriage to
Miss Matilda Verboncoer and the
young couple located in Minneapolis
shortly thereafter. In 1893 the family
located on a farm in Greenbush, where
deceased resided until 1910, when he
returned to Minneapolis. He has been
at the home of his daughter in Green
bush since last May.
The widow and five children sur
vive, viz: Louis, and Mrs. Harry
Plumondore of Princeton, Mrs. T. S.
Corteau of Greenbush, Mrs. Arthur
Pilon and Miss Aurelia of Minneapolis.
The children take this means to ex
press their heartfelt thanks to all who
tendered sympathy and aid to them
during their recent bereavement. They
are truly appreciative.
Real Estate Valuations Increased.
County Auditor Doane has been no
tified by the State Tax commission
that the assessed value of real estate
in towns of Mille Lacs county has
been increased 10 percent. This in
crease applies to structures and im
provements as well as lands. No
change was made in the assessed val
ue of real estate in villages.
The commission feels that the
changes are conservative and they will
stand unless it is clearly shown that
a mistake has been made.
The commission is now working on
the personal property abstracts and
hopes to have same complete at an
early date.
Two Fined.
A game warden arrived in this
vicinity last week, and remained over
until Monday. While here he gath
ered in F. W. Manke and J. S. Sproes
sig, on a charge of hunting without
a license. Both entered pleas of
guilty before Justice Dickey Monday,
VOLUME XL. NO. 42
and were each fined $10 and costs.
Mr. Manke has not been keen on hunt
ing lately, and this was the first time
he had been out in four years. In
fact he was visiting his brother-in
law, Frank Schilling, Sunday, when
taken. When he left the village he
had no idea of going after ducks,,
otherwise he would have armed him
self with a license. This is the first
time that a game warden has visited
this part of Uncle Sam's domain in a
couple of years, and the one who was
here threatens to return before the
close of the season.
New Coins.
Princeton, with the rest of the coun
try, will soon be using the new coins
in the denominations of dimes, quar
ters and half dollars being turned out
by the government mints at the rate
of 1,000,000 a day. A break in the
machinery of the mint caused a slight
delay.
The 10-cent coins bear the figure of
a Grecian woman on one side and a
bundle of rods and the ax of the
Roman lictors on the other. The new
quarter-dollar pieces bear the stamp
on one side of the full figure of a
woman coming through a gate in a
wall and an eagle in flight on the re
verse. The 50-cent coin shows the full
length figure of the Goddess of Lib
erty, holding olive branches, and also
of an eagle with its wings spread
standing on a rock.
An Interesting Contest.
There is an interesting contes for
county commissioner in the fifth com
missioner district, Sherburne county.
The district comprises the towns of
Baldwin, Livonia, Orrock and the vil
lage of (Zimmerman) Lake Fremont.
Mr. L. F. Brown of Zimmerman is a
candidate, and his opponent hails from
the extreme western end of Orrock.
The Baldwin and Livonia people claim
that they have not had a fair deal in
the matter of the division of county
and state road funds and that question
will enter largely into the fight. The
worst piece of road in Sherburne coun
tythe state road from Zimmerman
to Princetonis located in the district
and it is to be hoped whoever is elected
will favor the permanent improvement
of that much-traveled road.
His Choice.
"Where is your lawyer?" inquired
the judge.
"I have none," responded the pris
oner "haven't any money."
"Do you want a lawyer?" asked the
judge.
"Yes, your honor."
"There is Mr. Smith, Mr. Brown and
Mr. Green," said the judge, pointing to
the young attorneys waiting, briefless
and breathless, for something to turn
up, "and Mr. Alexander is out in the
corridor."
The prisoner eyed the budding at
torneys and, after a critical survey,
said, "Well, I guess I'll take Mr. Alex
ander."
An Ingenious Device.
M. T. Spangers, a Benton county
farmer residing in the vicinity of
Sauk Rapids, has patented an ingen
ious contrivance. It consists of a pul
ley wheel that can be attached
to the direct drive of an auto
mobile. It can be put on or taken off
in a few minutes. By means of this
attachment the engine of an automo
bile can be used to operate power ma
chines such as feed mills, sawing out
fits, etc.
Bound Over to Grand Jury.
Peter Larson was arrested by Sher
iff Harry Shockley early Sunday morn
ing, and charged with greivously
wounding Fred Goulding with a dan
gerous weapon. The preliminary hear
ing was had before Justice Dickey
Monday afternoon. Goulding failed
to appear and Sheriff Shockley signed
the complaint. The defendant waived
examination and was bound over to
the grand jury in the sum of $500.
Self-Evident.
The eminent lecturer had just fin
ished his two hours talk and he was
walking back to the hotel with one of
the committeemen.
"Do you think the people heard me
distinctly?" asked the lecturer earn
estly.
"Some of 'em did,* said the bored
committeeman as he stifled a yawn,
"for I saw 'em get up and go out."
Both in the Mire.
Honest, now, which is the deepest in
the mire, the contemptible pinhead
who from the street corner makes
scurrilous remarks about passing
women, or the woman who, by studied
art of displaying her "charms," makes
a plain bid for this" unenviable notori
