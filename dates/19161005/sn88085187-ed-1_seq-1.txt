KENWORTHY DIVORCE
REOPENED BY JUDGE
Tlie curtain which ,T. Fred Ken
worthy, of South Tacoma, has at
tempted to throw over his divorce
from Agnes Kenworthy was rais
ed by Judge Clifford Thursday
when he ordered the case re-open
ed and allowed .Mrs. Kenworthy
to appear ln her defense.
Kvents, happening in quick suc
cession, indicated that the divorce
trial will he one of the most sen
sational and bitterly fought seen
in Tacoma in a long time.
Kenworthy is secretary-treasur
er of W. H. Kenworthy & Co.,
wealthy Tacoma grain merchants.
Mrs. Keuworthy's attorney,
charging that the default divorce
had been obtained by KKenwor
thy in violation of court rules and
without his wife's knowledge,
asked Judge Clifford to reopen
the case.
Complaint Sustained.
Discarding technicalities of the
law, Judge Clifford ruled Unit
I Mrs. Kefiworthy should be given
j a chance to contest her husband's
sensational charges.
"Public policy demands It," he
said. "The state must protect Its
marriages, and even if the default
divorce was technically legal, I
should order the case reopened."
Another development of the
day was when the judge sent out
an order directing Kenworthy's
attorney immediately to return to
the court the complaint in the
case which he has kept out of the
official files in his possession ever
since the day it was filed.
This complaint against Mrs.
Kenworthy Involves even more
sensational charges than those
made against him.

CUT OUT
RISQUE
MOVIES
An official board of film cen
sors, who will insjie. t and ap
prove or reject every motion pic
ture exhibited in the Tacoma
movie houses, will be appointed
by Commissioner l'cttit within a
few days.
The board will have full pollco
powers, may order motion picture
exhibitors to cut out any objec
tionable feutures of films, and
even may refuse to permit pic
tures to be shown here.
The censors will be backed tip
by a censoring law now in effect,
but which has not been enforced
for more than a year.
"I will not appoint narrow
minded persons or radicals to the
board," declared Commissioner
Pettlt Thursday. "Hut 1 want
the members to be awake to the
dangers that immoral or risque
pictures produce, principally with
young jiersons, and I want them
to be strict in their censorship of
the suggestive type of movie."
Pettit's determination to ap
point a censorship board was an
nounced Thursday after a com
mittee of Tacomans, representing
religious associations of the city,
called upon him and objected
strenuously to the showing of
"Purity," a film now being ex
hibited at a Hroadway theater, in
which the leading woman appears
in many nude poses.
The committee also declared
that many lascivious films had
heen exhibited In Tacoma recent
ly, and that they were having a
pronounced effect on the minds
of the youth of the city.
"I do not intend to be straight
laced with the movie people,"
said Pettit, "hut 1 do Intend to
prevent the exhibition here of
films which tend to deprave the
minds of our children. 1 do not
believe that the better claBS of
exhibitors will object at all to the
censoring."
H. T. Moore, manager of the
Colonial theater, declared Thurs
day that he was pleased to hear
of Pettit's plans.

ASKS ALL
BIG CITIES
TO FIGHT
After telling the city council
that the T. H. ft P. Co.'s suit to
camel all franchise charges for
operating street cars in Tacoma is
one of the most far-reaching cases
that the city has ever faced, City
Attorney Harmon Thursday set
about asking Seattle, Spokane and
other large cities of the state to
help liini in the defense.
Tie will go to Seattle Friday
to enlist the aid of Corporation
Counsel Caldwell. In the mean
time he has written to Spokane,
and will probably notify Aberdeen,
North Yakima, Vancouver and
other citlaa.

If tlie public service commis
sion should hand down a ruling
abrogating the T. R. <fc P. Co.'s
franchise contracts, and relieving
that company of any paving,
bridge, street work, or free trans
portation charges, the same rul
ing would relieve all street car
companies ln other cities from
similar burdens.

from the public service commis
sion Weiluesday night, giving him
lQ days to answer. He told
the council Thursday that he
could not possibly answer such a

Not since the -loyer-Pettibone-Haywood case lias Idaho been rocked with
excitement as it is today.
One of the star roles in this drama probably will be played by the pretty and
vivacious young wife of Rossi. The defense will seek to prove that it was for
her that he took the life of Dalquist.
Although Rossi is well into the niid-jiiitne of manhood, she is but 118. Lively
and attractive, she was a popular belle in this little city's social life.
Out of a clear sky broke the

Returning to Wallace, he went di

Before he crossed the threshold
of his home, he was a sane, hard
headed man of affairs. When he
came out again, a few moments
later, a change had come over
him. He had been converted sud
denly into a mad man.
He walked directly to the Sam

Staring fixedly ahead, his jaws

They came forward to greet lilm.
In the lobby, also, was Dalqulst.
finishing his friends aside, Hossl,
tlie mad man, approached Dal
(ltiist, drew a revolver and struck
him over the head.
Dalqulst crumpled on the floor,
but arose again quickly and start
ed to run. Rossi aimed and fired.
Although hit, Dalquist darted like
a hunted hare, behind the clerk's
desk, and cringed there, helpless
with terror, as Rossi silently dos
ed In on him. Rossi aimed again,
but friends snatched the weapon
from him.
Rossi then started out of the
hotel, saying he would give Dal
qulst ten minutes in leave town.
Dalqulst said he'd go, If he could
find an auto. But when physi
cians examined him they found he
was mortally wounded. He died
late the next day.
What Was Motive?
Meantime, the once gay and vi
vacious Mrs. Rossi had become
hysterical and a nervous wreck.
She had taken to a sanitarium ln
another city, and later left the
state. The defense attorneys
have declined to say where she la.
Rossi was locked up in the
county jail, charged with Dal-
Iqulst's murder.
Why did Rossi kill Dalqulst?
What did he find when he enter
ed his home which converted him
like a flash from a peaceful citi
zen into a man-hunter?
It is known that Dalqulst was
a frequent caller at the Rosal
home, and that he was there with
a group of friends, the night be

Beyond that, there is little hut
speculation to go on. It is believ
