WSTITUTIONS
Problem of Defectives is
Serious, Says State
Board.
STERILIZATION
yRGED
AS SOLUTION
Commission to Investigate
Will be Asked of Next
Legislature.
Bismarck, N. D., Oct. 5.—North
Dakota is supporting in its penal and
charitable institutions 1,803 human
beings of whom a decided percentage
are there because of mental defects,
transmitted from parents, reports the
board of control. So1 grave has the
situation become that the board is
seriously considering recommending
to the legislature next winter the
naming of a commission to investigate
conditions in the state generally, with
a view to proposing stricter marriage
regulations-
A case, while not. typical, will illus
trate the point which the board
wishes to bring out. In the northern
part of the state a number of years
ago, the town fool, an easy going,
harmless sort of fellow, married an
idotic woman, the daughter of her
own sister by a common father. Ev
eryone was familiar with the condi
tion of both parties to this marriage
contract, but no one interfered. After
six defective children had been born
to this woman, she and her brood
were committed to the asylum for
the feeble minded at Grafton, where
she has since been carded for. The
husband and father about a year later
was murdered. The murderer is now
in the penitentiary at Bismarck, and
a brother of the slayer is in the state
hospital\for the insane at Jamestown,
having been removed thither from
Grafton. Nothing has been done to
prevent the reproduction of any of this
crew of degenerates until an actual
crime, as defined, by the statutes,
brought them within the ken of the
authorities. The board of control
feels that there is something wrong
with a system which will permit such
a situation to arise.
Sad Case at Grafton.
At Grafton there is another case
demanding attention. A woman com
mitted thence from Bismarck' four
years ago, shortly after, her. arrival
In theinstitution gave birth to a fine
boy: The youngster has remained a
charge at Grafton to this date. ,He*
is apparently normal, and an un
usually bright youngster, but the state
has made no. provision for his caret
and ho one cares, to. adopt the off
spring of a defective mother. If he
remains exposed to the atmosphere
of the institution,' in- spite of every
thing the superintendent and attend
ants may do for him, he cannot be
expected to become a normal young
man. Yet he is condemned to remain
there until sortie, power intervenes.
"The feeble minded are filling our
charitable and penal institutions," de
clared a member of the board yester
day. "It is not true that everyone
committed to prison is mentally defec
tive, but I believe it is safe to say that
a majority are. Sterilization or some
other method-should be resorted to
to relieve the state from the necessity
of caring for the offspring of sub
normal mothers 'and fathers."

Admission of Yellow Race
Bitterly Opposed by
Federation.
Eureka, Cal., Oct. 5.—At the end
of a protracted debate on the advisa
bility of admitting Japanese to Cali
fornia' labor unions, or organizing
them separately, the California state
passage of a resolution decrying em
ployment or patronlzation of Japan
ese labor in any form:
The debate on the convention floor
led by Hugo Ernst, head of the Cul
inary Workers of San Francisco, and
participated in by a number of dele
gates on Japanese unionization, 'be
came heated at times. It was stated
that in all likelihood the matter was
closed for at least another year.
A majority of the speakers appear
ed to favor separate Japanese labor
unions in preference to admitting the
Asiatics into existing labor organiza
tions.
Organization in Japan as a pre
liminary to unionization here was ad
vocated an an educational step, bet
ter fitting the Japanese laborer to en
ter this country as wage earner, it
was said by virtue of a higher wage
scale and raised standards of living
previously gained in Japan.
"If Japanese are organized," as
serted Ernst, "they will be removed
as a source of unfair competition in
the labor market. I would then be
willing to take any chance with them
and if the Asiatic was more fit for
my position than I he would win the
job and deserve it."
SOUP KITCHENS RUSHED
Berlin' Fopd Shortage Said by Social

London, Oct. 5, Great difficulty
is being experienced' in provisioning
Berlin, according to the Socialist
newspaper, Vorwaertz. of that city, as
quoted by Reuter's Amsterdam cor
respondent.
The potato supply is reported as
completely stopped during last few
days, the interruption being attribute
ed to a laclt of field laborers.
The decrease In the ,milk supply is
a subject of anxious discussion of the
authorities, the newspaper says. Many
large milk dealers have 'discontinued
consignment to the city owing to the
shortage, also to the fact that when
they have been able to send small
quantities the profit is slight.
According to this information there
has been a great rush to soup kitch

A
NEW HIGH MARK $ REGISTERED
YESTERDAY AND TODAY
MANY ARE TRADING IN WHEAT
—FEVERISH ORDERS RE­
With wheat prices on the Minne
apolis and Chicago exchanges reach
ing new high marks almost daily,
farmers and business men of northern
North Dakota and the entire north
west are making thousands of dollars#
declare grain commissioners. Within
the past two weeks, farmers in this
section of the Red River valley have
made large amounts, it was reported
at the local office of the Charles E.
Lewis grain commission house today.
There are rumors that as high as
$100,000 has been cleared In the op
erations. It is said that it has not
been uncommon for minor operators
to make $15,000 within a short time.
Yesterday's and today's sessions
were exceedingly busy and exciting.
Yesterday, December wheat on Min
neapolis' exchange reached the high
est mark since the war opened and
today it advanced even farther. The
high mark today—$1.71*—was
reached shortly after the market
opened.
Reports from Minneapolis com
municated much of the excitement to
the little group of traders who fre
quent the local Lewis & Co., exchange.
Magazines, which help to pass the
dragging minutes, were dropped and
eyes were glued on the boa,rd. As the
figures started to climb orders came
rapidly, There were feverish requests
for more wheat, but, as the price

Approves.
London, Oct. 6.—A report that a

Essad Pasha, former provisional
president of Albania, has been receiv
ed in Amsterdam, according to a. Reu
ter's dispatch.
The commanding general at Con

that Essad Pasha was proved at his
trial., to have consp.lred with bandits
against Turkish empire and to have
declared war on Turkey. By doing
so, the report says, and by his hostile
attitude, he rendered service to Tur

The sentence of death has been
confirmed by the sultan.

FACES
CONSCRIPTION
Chief of the Imperial Staff
Demands More
Men.
London, Oct. 5.—When parliament
reassembles next week the govern
ment will be confronted with new
embarrassing proposals for the appli
cation of conscription to Ireland. The
Times and other newspapers recently
have been conducting a strong cam
paign with this object in view and the
decisions announced today by General
Sir William Robertson, chief of the
Imperial staff, that more men are
urgently needed, will, it is believed,
strengthen the hands of the agitators
who have been joined by Sir Edward
Carson.
Sir Edward asserts that the situa
tion Is such that without conscription
in Ireland it will be impossible to
even maintain the Irish regiments at
the front in their proper strength.
He contends that Ireland could pro
vide another half million men of
military age and asks what the
colonies, which have made such sacri
fices for the empire, will think of the
shirking of Ireland.
While most of the responsible poli
ticians are agreed that it would be in
expedient to attempt to apply com
pulsion to Ireland while home rule is
withheld from it, undoubtedly In the
present phase of the European war
those who are demanding conscription
hold a strong hand and the govern
ment may find It difficult to resist
their demand.

section of the northern half pf the
state, as far west us Mlnot, and a
large portion of northwestern Minne
sota.
This morning, shortly after trading
began, the price of December wheat
went up to $1.71, and then reached
$1.71%. Within a short time, there
was a slight .break and the price went
back to $1.71. Somehow that seemed
to presage something to one trader,
and he rushed forward with a "sell"
slip in his hand. His order was flash
ed over the wine and he sat down
again to watch the board.
In the meahtime. the telephone was
busy. Inquiries and orders came
from all over, northern North Dakota
and northwestern Minnesota, as the
market conditions were recited over
the wire, orders were quickly chang
ed. Came demands to buy December,
came others to sell May some want
ed to know how they had fared yes
terday, others sought advice as to to
day's operations.
"If we could tell what is going to
happen in Argentina, we could tell
what the market will do," was the in
variable reply to requests for advice.
"The east has made its' money in
stocks," said Adolph Idlstad, manager
of the Lewis office today, "while the
northwest is making it in wheat."
The high prices have come at the
right time. This year's crop was a
virtual failure,- btit farmers are realiz
ing heavily on what, wheat they hold-
December wheat is dealt in particu
larly, although lately there have been
operations in May. The entire north
west has been "bullish" throughout
these feverish market days and the
farmers are profiting thereby.
"Farmers firmly believe that wheat
will, reach $2," continued Mr. Idlstad,
"and many of them are holding their
possessions. In some cases, they are
adding to their supply. The market
promises to be exceptionally Interest
ing for some time."

London. Oct. 5.—A new surgical
discovery as remarkable as the X-ray
is now on trial in the British hospi

enables one to obtain in daylight a
picture of any internal organ of the
body.
The discoverer got his medical edu

.James Shearer, a Scotchman, now a
sergeant in the British medical corps.
He was graduated from the Univer
sity of Washington with the degree
of M. P., but the Journal says he
cannot be given a commission as a
surgeon because his degree is not rec
ognised in Great Britain.
The new appliance enables the sur
geon to get a detailed picture of the
brain, showing all its blood vessels,
by which blood clots on the brain
may be revealed. It will take a pic

abscess. Wounds or cuts in any or
