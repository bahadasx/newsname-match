The Kidlcy hoys, Tom and Merle,

The music was a la Cowboy.
The evening display of balloons and

The only resident official at that time
was a justice of the peace. He tried
one case and could do nothing with it.
His second case was for sanitary neg

Cowboys General Roundup
The Roundup was the biggest event
ever pulled off in this section of tho
state. People came for many rnile.s
rrom all directions to the First Round
up in Tucumcari, The attendance has
been up in the thousands and what
was feared would be failure linancial
l. iias been sullicient to pay the
oig attractions their guarantee.
Slim Allen and his wife were hero
and made good. They were not suc-
ftil in pulling down the lirst prizes
in many of the events because of the
fact that some of the host riders and
opei". as well as branders are resi
dents of this immediate country, and
they were here to work and win. Few
of I he contestants were second raters.

have class sullicient to enter them in
any contest, the biggest in this coun
try, were here to assist the local man
agement make this lirst event a suc-t-e
-... and it was a success.
The steer riding contest the lirst
day was marred with the serious in
jury of the lirst contestant, Hud
Clayton, who fell underneath the ani
mal when he jumped the fence. Clay
uiti was picked up and remained un
conscious for several minutes. Life
-eemed extinct, but he was finally re
xivedVy physicians from the crowd.
The contests proceeded and but few
dhur accidents happened.
Fancy roping, calf branding, relay
.aces, i. rone busting and bulldoggiug
were n. good as you will see anywhere
and tho immense crowds were satis
tied. The wild mule race was oik- oT
the special features that won praise
from everybody present. It was a
real treat. The steer bull-dogging was
cellent and those in charge made it
possible to pull off the big events in
I'ront of the grand stand so that no
person could fail to get his money's
worth.
The News, as well as the other pa
pers of the county, repeatedly adver
'ised that the general admission would
he fide and the grand stand 25c, there
tore there was no excuse for anyone
not knowing before hand that the big
Roundup would not be free. The main
events started shortly after one o'clock
.ud continued until dark. Most of tho
'rowd stayed until the last event of
'he afternoon was linished. The price
of admission was cheap considering
i lie prices paid for circuses and tent
hows that only last about an hour and
a half. The steer bulldoggiug on the
second day, Wednesday, ivas worth the
admission price and it would take a
groat deal more nerve, thin most of
us have to undertake the job of bull
dogging some of tho long-horns. It
i- true the purses for the big events
were large but there were a largo nuni
her of entrants and in order to so-
... ..v.- .
lire the best talent it was necessary
hi hang up suitable purses.
The town hns been.nllvu with cow
men and cowboys, most of whom are
perfect gentlemen, some have been
loud and a few have been intoxicated,
but taken as a whole everything has
A newspaper man of Chicago was

much in evidence. He answered that
he was not. That during the summer
he had had his pockets picked three
times in Chicago, hut he had not lost
a penny since coming here, so it is
not so had ns some of us thought it
would he. The first day some of the
! ,,0.vs '"''i' persuaded hy the moving
picture man to rate into the saloons
that he might secure nine real son

night were well patronized and while

Two moving picture shows were work
ing overtime to accommodate the big
crowd; the jitno dance was one of the
popular attractions, while the concert
by the Amarillo band wns highly en
joyed by everyone.
The boxing exhibition wns good and
while most of us do not fully under
stand this game it seemed like there
was too much clinching and stalling
on the part of l.ubb. who was handi
capped by the superior boxing and
reach of Livingston. Luhh is a hard
man to hi', he thinks a whole lot of
that mug and Livingston's wallops,
while numerous did no bother him in
the east. He worried Livingston con-1

dier won the decision of the referee.
He was the aggrossor most of the time j

to him to win on points. The decision
of the referee was satisfactory.

FIKK PREVENTION DAY
l.nst year lire prevention day. Octo
ber It. was observed and officially rec
ognized in Thirty-one stales ami near
ly all the large cities. Wo are too
busy rounding up and being rounded
up to prepare for anything else but
we can at least remember the duy and
know that much is being done in other
places to check the monster that is de
stroying millions of dollars in prop
erty each year. In this windy country
it is our duty to avoid lire and we of
Tucumcari should be unusually careful
until the city can provide better fire
lighting facilities.
It. has been said that carelessness
is our national sin and that ninety per
cent of our (ires originate in careless
ness. For the year ending Oct. 1th,
'Tucumcari has been extremely fortu
nate, having only nineteen alarms and
no disastrous fires. Of the nineteen
calls, four was eaused by defective
flues, three by throwing out ushe
with lire in them, three by burning
trash, two by children playing with
matches, two from oil stove, two un
known, one from leaving hot iron on
banril. one from clenninir with laso-
line and one false alarm.
. These causes cover the most corn-
mon errors ami we mention them with
i the hope that it may be the means of
(avoiding future fires from similar

built with adobes at small expense.
ChildiX'ii will play with matches u
long as there are children and matches
but it s no less than criminal negli
gence for a man to run lire up through
his house without knowing something
about the flue that carries it. For the
safety of your own property ami the
safety of your neighbors property, do
not put up your stoves until you have ,
had your flues examined and cleaned. I
The storing of gasoline and other
explosives should be regulated by our
city council. An other menace that is
confronting us is the shingle roof.
They should not be allowed to endan
ger the business district. A few weeks
a.go thr"c cities burned to the ground
iu two days. The loss was estimated
at Nine Million dollars. Knginoers
and fire experts claim that the shingle

a safe distance from the congested dis- ,
trict. Our school buildings are un-
protected, having neither water nor i
chemical aparatus. A good plan would 1

for the responsible position of County
Superintendent of Kducation 1 was at

great a trust being thrust upon rue.
In fact I had thought women hud no
business in politics, and I would yet,

me that politic" means more than
pnrty strife.
Looking upon the work of School
Superintendent as a high office and a
position in which all the people are to

the public that if the majority should

OLD NEWSPAPER MAN HERE
W. G. Conner, formerly a newspaper
publisher in Missouri, but now a resi
dent of the Woodrow neighborhood,
was in Tucumcari Friday. Mr. Con
ner has been convinced that Tucumcari
merchants sell goods about as low as
thev do anywhere. He would not own
up that tho rnunup had anything to
do with his coming here this week,
hut he is ono of the youngest old men
in this county, nnd no doubt enjoys a
little wild west sports.

not in time to speak. They were here
Tuesday for the 1st day of the big
rolindllfi and succeeded in meeting the
v.olc 01 .
voters of the county who received
l'.n rciou'y'
Hon. A. A. Jones, Hon. W. H. Wnl-
,?" a"" ,Ion Antonio Lucero arrived
Tuesday and addressed u trood sized
audience composed of representative
citizens of Quay county, nt the Court
House that evening.
Mr. Walton was first to speak and
he made an extra good impression up
on his hearers. He recited some of
the past experiences of the recent leg
islatures in New Mexico, also told of
he manipulation of the republican no-
litical machine. He would make a
renresentative in conirresr. tbnt wntihl
be a credit to the state and would
work for the interests of the state as
well as tiie nation.
Mr. Jones was then introduced airul
it is useless to comment on his con
vincing arguments in favor of the
present administration. He upheld the
president's Mexican policy nnd every
other policy favored anil passed hy the
president and congress. Mr. .tones !k
a big broad-minded statesman without
a political hlcmish ami there is little
doubt about him defeating Mr. Hul -bel,
the republican nominee. He will
have the united support of the Dem
ocracy or this county as he lias at all
times stood by the homesteader and
citizens of this part of the state. He
will also secure a number of republi
can votes, from those who know and
appreciate his ability.
Hon. Antonio Lucero addressed tin.
audience in English Tuesday nigh, and
again on Wednesday morning at the
Court House he addressed the Spanish
speaKing voters in their native tongue.
Mr. Micei-0 is a hrm believer in good
schools and has figured nut the right
way to abolish the race miegtion. He
thinks the only way is to teach all
pupils the English language and when
they all speak the same there will be
no more race issue. He said it was
natural for anyone to suppose that
a man speaking a foreign language
must necessarily he a foreigner. While
the Spanish-Americans are Americans
by birth thev do not seem mt induce
they learn to speak the English lan
guage which is generally accepted as
the American language.
Messrs. Jones, Walton, and Lucero
spent Wednesday here ifottine- i.e.

Went to LoL'lin and addreuKnil nn mi.

Christian Church. There appears to
he more or less confusion upon this
point. Come and hear the scriptural
teaching upon this very important
question. The 11 o'clock subject will
be: "Heboid. I Knock!"
Our hearts were miiile to ntminn
when four made the great confession
