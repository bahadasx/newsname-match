REV. POLLITT GONE
TO NEW HOME.
Rev. S. II. Pollitt. for four years
pastor of our local Methodist church,
was recently transferred to Jackson
where he at one assumed the pastorate
of the M. E. church of that city. The
departure of Rev I'ollitt from Lancaster
is a source of deep regret to every one,
irrespective of denomination, because
during his stay with us he has endeared
himself to all the people of this coun
try. Since he has been pastor of the
local church Rev. Pollitt has advanced
the interests of this denomination to a
remarkable degree and has contributed
t to the most successful period of its ex
istence. He is a hard working "Soldier

SEES VICTORY
IN NEW YORK'S VOTE.
rresident Wilson is greatly pleased
over the result of the N'evv York pri
mary und says he is sure thut the Dem
ocrats will curry the State in November.
The vote of the Republicans showed a
condition of bitter factional fight in thu
ranks of thu party in the stnte where
Candidate Hughes has never shown
himself especially strong, his election
twice us governor being due to other
causes rather than his own popularity.
As Roosevelt was turned down by the
KuUeritea at Chicago so was the
Roosevelt Candidate turned down in
New York. Macon, u man of much
ability, being defeated by Culder. a
comparatively unknown quantity, who
wus vigorously supported by German
forces.
On the other bund the Democrats
nominated McCombs, a man of known
ability und integrity, while their nom
inee for governor. Judge Seubury, is
u vastly superior man toWhitman, whu
has of ten proven his smallness dm lug
his incumbrance of the office. With
the advantage of candidates und one
third of the Progressives voting for
them prospect of Democrats success in
the Empire State is n.sy with strong
indications that Wilson and Marshall
will carry the State. Hughes only hope
la on the full vote of disloyal Germans
who would claim a big victory for the
Kaiser in his attempt tn control this
government through those, who al
though they huye sworn loyalty to this
government, are more loyal to the
Fatherland.
President Wilson believes that
Americans will stand for America and
does not entertain a doubt of his re
election and his confidence imparts an
enthusiasm tliat is contagious.

The W. C. T. U. Convention which
convened in Lexington, Ky., lust week
was largely attended und much enthus-
iam shown. The business men of Lex
ington were Very cordial in their greet

REVIVAL DRAWS
LARGE CROWDS.
The revival at the Christain churcTi
is drawing large crowds and every
night the house is pacKed with an ear
nest and interesting congregation
which taxes its seating capacity.
Evangelist Brooks is making earn
est and forceful appeals. His ser

afternoon to the women were particu
larly strong ones. The singing at each
service, under the direction ot Mr.
Fred Warner is also a distintive fea
ture and entered into heartily by the
choir and audience. Mr. Warner is t
man of magnetic personality, the au
dience soon catches his spirit and notes
of joy und praise bursts forth which
lifts the thoughts to God and makes
the heart receptive to the message so
earnestly delivered by Rev. Brooks.
Soul winnirg is the matter of great
est concern in this meeting and Christ
ens of all Jdenoninations are asked to
cooperate in making this revival bene
ficial to the spiritual life of the city.

To those she thought of and loved
so well.
