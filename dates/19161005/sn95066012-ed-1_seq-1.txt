Boston Enthusiastic Over Opening
Game on Saturday
JACK BARRY MAY NOT PLAY
Injured Hand May Keep Star
Keystone Backer Out of the
Came.
Boston, Oct. 4. Enthusiasm over
the opening game ot the world's series
scheduled to take place at Braves'
Field on Saturday afternoon is running
riot throughout the Hub. Announce
ment by the Red Sox authorities to
day that every oue of the 27,000 seats
available for reservation at Braves'
Field has been covered by applica
. tions is evidence of the popularity of
the Sox and of the coming series. The
demand for reserved tickets is so tre
mendous that many thousands of dol
lars will have to Be returned by the
American League club through in
ability to fill orders for the coverted
pasteboards.
There has not been much betting
on the series thus far, for the good
reason that there is no Brooklyn
money to cover the thousands held by
Boston commissioners and individuals
Odds of 10 to 7 are being offered on
the Red Sox, and though it is a base
ball axiom that n team is ever a 2 to
1 proposition, it is quite probalae that
the odds will soar to thathei ght before
the first game on Saturday.
Manager Bill Carrigan's remarkable
pitching Btaff is responsible for the
lack of confidence by those who wager
on the ability of the Robins to come
through in the championship series.
When the great trio of Boston twirlers
Leonard, Shore and Ruth are con
sidered there are few who would be
willing to take their chances against
them.
It appears very likely that Jack Bar
ry, the veteran second baseman, and
one of the coolest and most successful
ball players who ever took part in a
world's series, will not play against
Brooklyn. When the Sox took the
field at Braves' Field for practice thia
afternoon, Barry toyed around second
base, but his injured hand was still
weak, and he took no chances on fur
ther decreasing Its prospects of recov
ering by Saturday.
Barry may prove an incalculable loss
to Carrigan. Throughout the season
he was a mainstay in the Sox infield,
and when he quit through the Injury
the team seemed to fall off somewhat
In its play. Barry In not a wonderful
hitter, nor a spectacular fielder, but he
la remarkably steady, and in the pin
ches there is no better man in the na
tional game. His chief success lies in
Jiis cool, collected judgement.
Should it be that he will have to re
frain out of the coming series with
Brooklyn Barry's place at second will
be filled by Javrln, a youngster, who
has had a lot of experience, but who
might not bo able to stand up under
the strain as well as Barry.
All the other members of the team
are in wonderful condition.

! Gen. Robertson Says Entire Nation
Must Serve
WOMEN MUST SHARE BURDEN
Male Employes In Government Posi
tions to Be Displaced to Put
Men In Ranks.
London. Oct. 5. Gen. Sir William
Robertson, chief of the British imper
ial staff at army neadquarters said
yesterday In a speech at Balderby, Lin
colnshiie, that, while' the allies were
winning the war slowly but surely, he
wished to impress upon his hearers
the necessity of producing more men
for the army and munitions factories,
lu this connection, he said, he had a
serious word or warning to give. "We
are not justified in expecting to win
the war," he said, "unles the service
of every man and woman in the coun
try is utilized to the fullest extent."
"We must be under no delusion,"
he contiiried, "as to the end or prob
able duration of this great trufo-le.
We must be prepared to continue for
a time which cannot at present be
estimated. In fact we must be pre
pared for the worst while we hope
for the best. We have ndopted In
theory the principle of national serv
ice. We must see that we put it into
practice because we want more men,
and we want them now, and eventual
ly we shall want all who can be
t, pared."
Great Britain Is in urgent need of
men tor her armies and also for her
munitions factories, according to a
statement to this effect given out
yesterday by the man power distribu
tion board, recently appointed to comb
out men eligible- for miltary service
iu the United Kingdom who have not
yet been enroled in the arm;".
Tho board has under consideration
the extended use of women and of
men over the military a;;e and also the
release of men of military age now em
ployed in government olllcs This Is
tho only means, the bound s.ts, when
by extension of the agt tor compulsory
service can be avoided.
No ollieial figures hive been given
recently as to the number of men
serving with the Brit'i.h army. On
May 25 King George in signing the
military service bill placed the num
her raised up to that time at 5,041.
Ooo. In July, August and September
the British casaulties were 307,169.
PORSON'S WEAKNESS.
The DrinV He Got From Mrs. Hopp
ner'a Private Bottle.
In "Samuel Rogers and His Circle"
is this anecdote about Richard Porson,
the famous classical scholar find pro
fessor of Greek:
When Iloppner, the painter, was re
Hiding In a cottage a few miles from
London, Porson one afternoon sudden
ly urrived there. Iloppner said that
he could not offer him dinner, hs Mrs.
H. had gcuic to town and had carried
with her the key of the closet which
contained the wine. Porson declared,
however, that he would lie content
with a mutton chop und beer from the
next ale house and accordingly stayed
to dine.
During the evening Porson snld, "I
nm quite certain that Mrs. Iloppner
keeps some nice bottle for her private
drinking in her own bedroom, so pray
try If you can lay your hands on it."
His host assured him that Mrs. II. bad
no such secret stores; but, Porson in
sisting that a search should be made,
a bottle was nt last discovered in the
holy's apartment, to the surprise of
Iloppner and the joy of Porson, who
M)'in finished its contents, pronouncing
It to be the best gin he hod tasted for
a long time.
Next day Iloppner. somewhat out of
temper, Informed his wife that Porson
had tlrunli every drop of her concealed
dram. "Drunk every drop of it;" cried
m!io. "Heaven above, it. was spirits of
wine for the lamp!"

PROGRESS AT THE SOMME
British Official Statement Sums Up
Allies' Accomplishments.
London, Oct. 5. An official state
ment issued yesterday gives details of
the fighting on the Sonime front after
the advance of September 15, describ
ing the capture of villages including
Combles, Gueudecourt and Thlepval,
and proceeds: "These victories
brought our front line at more than
one point within a mile of the Ger
man fourth position west of the Ba-paume-Transloy
road."
I The statement continues: "The cn-
i emy has fought stubbornly to check
our advance, and since September 15
seven new divisions have been
brought against us and five against
the French. The severe and pro
longed struggle demanded on the part
' of our troops very great determina-
' tlon and courage.
I "At the end ot September the situa
tion may be summarized as follows:
Since the opening of the battle on
July 1, we have taken 26,735 prisoners
I and engaged 38 German divisions, of
) which 29 about 350,000 men) have
been withdrawn exhausted or broken.
We hold the half-moon upland south
of the Ancre, occupy every hight of
, Importance, and so have direct obser
' vation ground to the east and north
east. The enemy has fallen back upon
a fourth line behind a low ridge just
, west of the Bapaume-Transloy road,
j "The importance of the three
. months' offensive Is not to be judged
by the distance advanced or the nuin
' her of enemy trench lines taken. It
I must be looked for in the effect upon
the enemy's strength in numbers, ma
t terlal and morale. The enemy has
' used up his reserves In repated, cost
ly and unsuccessful counter-attacks
without causing our allies or our
selves to relax our steady, methodical
r.ressuic.
I "In this action forces from every
I part of the British empire and Brit
. Ish island have been engaged. All
behaved with the discipline and reso
lution of veterans. Our aircraft have
shown in the highest degree the spirit
of the offensive. They have patroled
regularly far behind the enemy's lines
and have fought many battles in the
air with hostile machines and many
with enemy troops on the ground.
Pnr (iiforv nmri!na that eunpnaria l.
I crossing our front it is safe to say
200 Brltsh machines cross the en

RECEIPTS OF rillLK
W:REW.YORKLESS
THAN ONE-HALF
Supply Will Diminish Daily Until
Settlement is Reached
DAIRYMEN FIRM IN DEMANDS
Distributors Agree to Make Advance
in Price But Not Enough to
Satisfy Producers
New Yoik, Oct. 4. With the failure
today of Mayor Mitchel to adjust tho
differences between producers and dis
tributors of milk, and the decision of
Attorney General Woodbury to begin
a state-wide inquiry into the causes
leading to the rupture, the situation
so far as the general public Is con
cerned tonight was said to be growing
acute.
A shortage of more than fifty per
cent in the milk supply which already
has resulted from the controversy, Is
causing much suffering, according to
the authorities. The supply is ex
pected to diminish rather than in
crease until a settlement is reached.
Two conferences today between
Mayor Mitchel and the distributing
companies, were futile.
After this second conference Mayor
Mitchel announced his efforts to bring
about a settlement had failed.
"This ends it as far as I am con
cerned," said the mayor. "I have done
my best to bring about a settlement."
According to the mayor the dairy
men demanded an advance of forty-five
cents a hundred pounds for the coming
six months contract.
The distributors with one exception,
submitted to the mayor that they were
willing to grant an advance of thirty
one cents during October only, with
the proviso that a commission, ap
pointed by the mayor, should investi
gate tho situation and report prior to
November 1.
The Borden Coudensed Milk com-.
pany told the mayor it had agreed to a
fifteen cent advance and would add to
that twenty cents more, making a total
advance of thirty-five cents with the
same condition as toa n investigation
by the mayor's commission.
"The dairymen rejected the proposi
tion "of the distributors." said the
mayor. "The distributors stand on
their proposition. No compromise
proposition was proposed, the proposi
tion of each side being submitted by
the mayor in turn to the other."

OUR NERVOUS AUDIENCES
In Too Much of a Hurry Near Close of
Entertainments.
Editor of the Manner: I was much
gratified last evening to see so many
of the audience in the opera house
ilse when the company sang "America
I Love Thect" All hail to the now
national anthem! I take It that the
people of Bennington are so used to
standing for the last number of tho
band concerts that their patriotism
demands that they rise as soon as the
door of the theatre squeaks and bo
gin to rush out. It reminds me of the
time when "Baldpate" played here,
and half the house was empty when
the curtain went down. The few who
remained saw It toll up again and
witnessed the epilogue of tho play,
which enabled them to go out and tell
their hasty friends how the mystery
was solved.
