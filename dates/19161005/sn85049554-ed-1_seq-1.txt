SWEDEN ALWAYS NEUTRAL.
Charges of Swerving from Impartial
Attitude iij War Are Untrue.
Stockholm, Oct. 6.—'^Sweden pro
claimed her attitude of neutrality at
the very outbreak of the war. AH her
actions since that time have borne out
that proclamation, and all rumors or
accusations that she has done or in
tends to "do anything inconsistent with
this attitude are due either to failure
to comprehend her situation or to
some less creditable reason. And
whenever Swed^p has taken any step
displeasing onevor other belligerent
poweh her action lhas been dictated
solely by considerations of the king
dom's own necessities and of its future
welfare, and i*o|T by any partisan rea
sons. We hoptf sincerely that the bel
ligerents will t»Ot make It impossible
for us to maintain this attitude unto
the end."
Thus in effect ftald Prime (Minister of
Sweden Dr. K. H. Hammarskjold to
the correspondent of the Associated

granted any foreign journalist since
the war began.
Throughout .the interview the pre
mier continued to lay stress on his
government's /desire to follow un
swervingly the policy of unpartlsan
shi,p thus far followed.
"And when^you get to know the
Swedes better yoru will, I think, find
that when they say or promise a thing
they mean It," said the minister.
