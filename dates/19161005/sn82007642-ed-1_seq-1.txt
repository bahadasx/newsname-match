l; That the Republican party is
reactionary.and a Bourbon was
demonstrated at Chicago last
, June. There were two political
nation a conventions held in that
town at that time one stand
pat, the ather progressive. There
was not; room enough in our
. country, big as it is, for both
:". those parties at the 'same time.
" One oi thera.had to die. The pro
; gressives were in ihe numerical
jnnjority, , aswaa snown oy tne
eloctionreturns of 1912, and it
was much fitter to live.than the
standpat concern, but it.was de
creed (that theprogressive party
BhoulddieXorder that the "Old
Guard" might live.
" Here was an;attenpt made by
its Jmost admired and its most
fAwfnl ' ihieftain Col. Roose
veltto reform and make prog
ressive the Republican party.
And it disastrously failed. It
was an impossible job.
"But it happened unto them
.'according to the true proverb.
The dog has returned to his own
vomit again: and the sow that
, was washed to her wollowing in
the mire "
In his admirablo address ac
cepting the nomination of the
democratic party September 2,
Mr. Wilson had this to say:
"The republican party is just
the party that cannot meet the
conditions of a new ago. It does
not know the way and it does
not wish new conditions. It tried
to W- ak away from the old lea
,i.iannfl ronld not. They still
select its candidates and dic
ttr its pulii-y, t ill resist change,
H'.ill hanker after the old condi
: tionx. still kuow no methods of
encouraging business but the old
methodists. When it changes its
leaders and its purposes and
brings its ideus up to date it will
have the right to ask the Ameri
can -people to give it power a
gain, but not until then. A new
age,, an age of revolutionary
change, needs new purposes and
new ideas."
No intelligent man has tbe har
dihood to challenge that state
ment. Such men as Lodge and
Gallinger, Penrose and Smoot,
Cannon and Mann do all the
thinking for the republican par
ty. They assert its principles and
dictate its programs, hvery
hnrtv knows that. Their chief
ambition is the enactment of an
other Payne-Aldrich robber tar
iff. All the other "issues" they
naat-rt. are nunor. trivial and
negligibler
Charles E. Hughes was nomi
. nated for president because he
was the one man who could ck
font Theodore Roosevelt for the
nomination. Driven out of politi
cal life in 1910 by Boss Barnes
he found a city of refuge on the
Mapreme bench, where he escap
ed the deluge of 1912. Touching
tin- issu-s of 191G, nobody knew
where he stood at the time he
was nominated, and ho has nev
er declared himself touching them
Kince, though his garulity is sim
ply enormous.- He jumps from
Ii!hr.to p -st in pathetic at
i, .,-.,ts t,. ifupt responsibility
for any positive word or deed
whatever.
He did deliver himself of one
startling7 statement, however,
when he disclosed that the stand-
' natters and the progressives had
' the same political ideas. Thus

As To Mismanagement, '
The Republican chatter about
Democratic extravagance and in
efficiency in Noi l h Carolina has
been growing manifestly weaker
and weaker aud by and by we
shall hear no more of it. Mis
management is no longer being
charged and the allegations are
becoming more vague and indefi
nite. There is cause for this sub
sidence. They are siuging migh
ty low in particular on the mat
ter ,of the audit of Treasurer
Lacy's books an audit which
they were invited to make. They
imported expert accountants
from New York and these experts
were given full access to the books
in the Tronsurer'n officer. The
Republicans had been making
loud boasts as to what would be
forthcoming, but all of a sudden
they lapsed into a denso silence.
Their auditors, after having gone
halfway through the task, re
ported that there was nothing
to be gained by the audit; that
the office was administered effi
ciently and cheaper than any
other State Treasurer's office in
theoountry and that the only
criticism whatever was to be
bund in the antiquated system
of book keepinir in use. The Re
publicans then dropped the mat
ter. They ought to have some
reward for their trouble and
expense, however, and the Obser
ver is inclined to gwe it to them
in the way of a gentle reminder
of what happened in the Treas
urer's office when Daniel Russell
was Governor in 1897 and the
Republicans were in control of
State affairs. Martin, the chief
clerk to State Treasurer Worth
stole $17,000 of the State funds,
was tried and convicted and if he
is not dead is even yet serving
his term in the penitentiary.
These thinirs'are recalled for the
enlightenment of the State.
