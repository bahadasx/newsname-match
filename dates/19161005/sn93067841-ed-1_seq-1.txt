VOL XXXI. KIXGSTREE, SOUTH CAROLINA, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1916. NO. 31
WILLIAMSBURG
COUNTY FAIR.
#
EARNEST APPEAL BY THE PRESIDENT
TO PEOPLE OF COUNTY TO
HELP MAKE IT BIG SUCCESS.
To those interested in Williamsburg
county's educational, agricultural
and social progress and development,
we wish to say a few words
on the part of Williamsburg County
Fair association.
Our fair was organized in the
spring of 1914, the year of the outbreak
of the terrible European war,
and because of the demoralized condition
that prevailed in our midst,
the executive committee thought it
best to postpone the holding of our
first fair that fall, afterwards, however,
many of our people expressed
regret over the postponement. We
held, as you know, a very creditable
fair last season, and at a recent call
meeting of our executive committee,
it was unanimously decided that we
should hold our fair this year as (
originally scheduled, November 8-11,
inclusive, despite the adverse storm
* conditions that are facing us, and
, that the Finance and Building committee
be authorized to go ahead
with the necessary improvement
work that we might hold even a better
and larger fair than last year.
The Building committee has put in
fifty additional stalls for horses;
doubled the capacity for the accommodation
for hogs, and added much
to the seatine capacity of the grand
stand. The committee on show
track improvements will have the
track in fine shape and a new house
for the Doultry will have ample accommodation
for all who have breeds
to exhibit. The poultry show bids
fair to being one of the leading feaI
tures of the fair.
Our Entertainment committee has
written Governor Manning asking
him to be with us on opening day;
Prof Daniels of Clemson College for
Educational Day, and Congressman
A F Lever for Agricultural Day.
Our secretary has secured free at"
' > i A-I M. _ ? I
tractions ior toe entertainment in
spectators, also a clean, high class
carnival and other tent attractions
for your enjoyment and amusement.
The heads of the different departraents
are urged to get busy, along
with each executive committeeman
and all others really interested in

doing something to further the material
progress of our county, that
we may all be made glad by the outturn
of our united effort in this connection.
Our neighbor, Clarendon county,
held its first fair last season, and arrangements
are already perfected
for the holding of the second fair
the week following ours. This county
is now well organized and is putting
forth united effort for the
greater success of their coming fair.
Should we not do as much for ourselves?
Florence county has planned
the biggest fair they have ever
held, and so has Orangeburg county.
These two counties have corporations,
with large capital, and
work with a view to making dividends
on tbeir investments. We
have a co-operative association, not
for the making of money, but for
the sole purpose for developing our
county, educating our people, and
keeping step in the general march
of progress.
We do not expect the same class
of farm exhibits that we had last
season, but we are expecting our
people to show the best they have.
There is no reason why all other departments
of our fair should not
show'marked improvement over last
season.
Mr C W Baker, our farm demon
strator, is arranging an exhibit covering
the entire phase of his work
which will prove both educational
and instructive to all of our people.
Miss Amanda Edwards, our county
superintendent in charge of Girls'
Canning Club and Home Demonstration
Economics, who is largely responsible
for the good household and
girls' canning club exhibit last season,
will give us a more elaborate
exhibit this season, and will also
have on exhibition the product qt
her eight county bread clubs. We
predict Williamsburg's greatest county
fair in 1916. We urge our people
to all co-operate in making this
possible. By The President.
The general convention of the
Episcopal church, which meets every
three years, will assemble next week
in St Louis. The deputies from
South Carolina are Revs John Kershaw,
D D, A S Thomas,K G Finlay,
A R Mitchell, Governor Manning
and Messrs T W Bacot, J P Thomas,
Jr, and H 1' Duvall. The alternates
are Revs Wm Way, 0 T Porcher. L
G Wood, W H K Pendleton, Walter
Hazard, Esq, and Messrs J N Frierson,
W C Bissell and P T Hayne.

BIG EXHIBITION
AT ORANGEBURG,
SOUTH CAROLINA CATTLE CONFERENCE
WILL BE HELD NEXT
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
Orangeburg, October 1:?South
Carolina farmers are going into the
live stock business. They are rapid
; ly placing their agriculture upon a
basis of prosperity and profit rather
than the fluctuating values of a onecrop
harvest. Forward steps are
being taken in every direction, and
one of the most vitally important
meetings ever held in this State is
the South Carolina Live Stock Exposition
and Cattle Conference which
will meet in Orahgeburg October 11
and 12. The opening address will
be delivered by Congressman A F
Lever.
This beneficial meeting is to be
held under the joint auspices of the
Southern Settlement and Development
Organization and the Orangeburg
Chamber of Commerce. Cooperating
with these bodies are
Clemson College, the State Agricultural
Department, the Federal Department
of Agriculture, and other
interested organizations. It has been
approved and largely praised by
leading farm specialists in this State,
and by many owners of live stock.
The nation will eventually look to
the South for its meat supply, and
it behooves every farmer and landowner
to consider the possibilities
that this coming industry may have
in store for him. The establishment
of packing houses at Orangeburg,
Greenville, and scores of other
Southern cities, are beacons along
the path of progress in Southern
agriculture and point the way to a
more glorious harvest of the natural
possibilities of our soil and situation.
To the forward looking farmer the
South Carolina Live Stock Exposition
and Conference is an occasion
that cannot be missed.
Among the leading agricultural
authorities and speakers who will attend
this conference are these well
known personages: Dr W K Lewis, i
leader of the campaign for the erad- i
ication of the cattle tick; E J Wat- j
son. State Agricultural Commission-'
|
er; Dr W W Long, the far-seeing;
director of the farm demonstration 1
work in South Carolina who had ad- j
vanced our farm industries as noj
| other man has been able to do; Con- i
I gressman A F Lever, chairman of j
the great House Agricultural com-!
mittee; and others. The subjects to
be discussed include the following:
Breeds and Results, Sizes and
, Weights, Grade Stock and Thoroughbreds.
Range Conditions, Pastures,
Forage Crops and Rotation, Silos
and Silage, Dairying and Dairy products,
Tick Eradication, Diseases,
[ Markets and Packing House Possibilities,
etc. Can any farmer or
| land-owner afford to miss it?
From responses already received
by Thos W Hughes, Special Agent
of the Southern Settlement and De nlnnmanf
Or era rn 7B h'nn fl ] n r CTP
number of fine specimens of live
stock will be on exhibit. L I Guion
of Lugoff will send twelve head of
Herefords, L W Boykin of Camden
will send nine shorthorns, and so on.,
It will be the great event of the1
year for those interested in live
stock. Every farmer and land-owner
should be in Orangeburg on October
11 and 12.

matter and should not he trifled

diseases start with a common cold.

HITS AT ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS. ,
It will be a surprise to a number *
of people to learn that Rev B F 1
McLendon, the evangelist, voted for 1
Blease in the last primary. The well '
known preacher says he could have '
elected Blease by telling: what he
knows, and why he voted for him, '
but we are afraid that he has simply
made a mistake in men, or has been '
badly fooled in some way. Having: '
taken this viewpoint of the race, it '
would have been untrue to his char- 1
acter to hav* denied it, and we find
the following: letter from him to 1
Rev Pierce Watson admitting his 1
action:
"A little fellow by the name of 1
Rogers at Florence has distributed (
a telegram that he sent me and my 1
reply over the State. I never do
anything that is covered up. And I '
had my personal reasons for voting !
for Cole Blease. As far as working '
for any candidate, I never opened '
ivirr month f-sPVpral nf IHV friends '
have wondered why it was I voted (
for him. If I had told the people 1
why I voted for him before the
election he would have been Governor
of South Carlina today. lama '
very busy man. and as several of 1
my friends are insisting, or at least
wanting to know why it was I voted
for him, just as soon as this evan- 1
gelistic campaign is over I am com- '
ing out in an open letter and give
my reason. (I Peter 3:13).
"Now Bro Watson, I never hit
anything with a tack hammer, and
when I write this letter I am going
to jar some people like a sledge
hammer had struck them. At one
time I was the most bitter man in
the State against Cole L Blease. I

told in this state, but just as soon as
I have time I am going to give out
an open letter which will put a different
complexion on things."?Or.

State Fair at Columbia October
23-27--Harvest Jubilee Again.
Columbia, September 30:?Continuous
advances in quotations for
cotton and the unprecedented prices
for cotton seed indicate that all previous
attendance records upon the
State fair will be shattered this year.
Preparations are being made rapidly
for the early installation of exhibits,
and reservations are being taken j
daily for special exhibits of farm I
machinery and other appropriate i
displays for the annual agricultural!
celebration while numerous booths
are being constructed by churches
and other organizations for lunch
rooms and refreshment stands. Consensus
of opinion is that farmers
over the State are receiving approx*imatelv
$100 for a bale of cotton
and the seed a trip is likely to be
made to the State fair October 2*3
to 27. i

A distinct feature of fair week
will be the Harvest Jubilee. This
festival introduced last year was an
mthusiastic success throughout the
week and was the means of bringng
thousands to Columbia who
would not have been otherwise disposed
to come to the fair. A been
Dt the Juouee is to De setectea again
this year in a manner similar to that
last fall and a ball will be given in
ler honor, following the coronation
ceremony in front of the capitol.
Horse racing is to be maintained
t>y a high scale of premiums this
pear. More than $1,700 will be
competed for in prizes in the different
events, and some particularly
high quality animals will be seen in
action on the fair ground turf.
Football games will be played on
two days of fair week, and this
alone will induce many to attend.
Free acts are to be placed on the
ground again this year as last, some
af the specialties being extraordinarily
attractive.
A meeting was held in Columbia
last week, when the farm demonstration
agent forces agreed to combine
their exhibits into one comprehensive
Statewide display of farm

products, ine county Dy L-uuuiy
exhibit plan will thus be abandoned,
and all exhibits arranged according
to crops, with all necessary information
as to production and fertilizer
and soil analysis data. The home
demonstration forces will also prepare
an interesting display.
All railroads are arranging suitable
schedules to bring the large
crowds to the fair, and the lowest
possible rate will prevail over all
lines.

BIG JUMP IN COTTON.
Low Condition and Small Crop
Send P/lces Up.
New York, October 2:?One of
the most sensational advances in the
history of the cotton market attended
the publication of the two government
reports here today. Since
the beginning of this season there
have been many periods of activity
and excitement, but none of them
have approached today's figures with
reference to the extent of fluctuations
or in volume of trading. The
demand was stimulated by the condition
figures of 56.3, or the lowest
on record, indicating a crop of offic- ,
ially 11,637,000 bales. Within a few
minutes after these figures were issued
January contracts sold at 17.03
j or $4.60 a bale above the closing
price of last week.
The census report showing 4,069,991
bales ginned prior to September
25 established a new high record,
but the trade had been looking for
even larger figures.
Col D J Griffith,for the past eighteen
years superintendent of the
State penitentiary, has announced
that he will not stand for re-election
when his term expires in January.
