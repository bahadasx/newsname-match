lie recreation ground being de:
yeloped in that section of Potomac
Park east of the Pennsylvania
railway embankment
j more accessible to those residents
[ of the District not provided with
automobiles or carriages, Gen.
j William M. Black, chief of engineers
of the army, has arranged
with the Commissioners of the
District for the establishment of
a suitable ferry across the Washington
channel as soon as the
necessary preliminaries can be
effected.
If satisfactory arrangements can be
* made the proposed ferry will be installed
and managed by private capital,
under government regulation, but if that
is found to be inexpedient, the ferry
will be established and operated by the
government. For the execution of the
alternative proposition in case of failure
of the other, estimates have been
prepared for submission to Congress
early in December next, with the view
of having the ferry ready for operation
in the early spring.
City Terminal at Seventh Street.
ADnrovpd nlans nrnvfdo f?r a famr
from the wharf of the old Alexandria
ferry at the foot of 7th street at its
Junction with L street, to a point on
Potomac Park directly opposite, near
which are to be located the field or
1 shelter house, and many of the major
< recreation features of the proposed
playground, including thirty-twe- tennis
courts and a nine-hole golf course. The
' river channel Is about 2,000 feet wide at
i that point, and can be reached easily In
aboqt five minutes. A merely nominal
) fare of a few cents for each passenger
. would be charged to help defray the
.' expenses of maintenance and operation.
With a view to economy only the
cheapest mode of locomotion is contem;
i plated* at tills time the main idea being
to afford ample and safe accommodation
i to the largest number of people. It is
i belMved that an ordinary ferry steamer
wofeld suffice for all purposes until the
elaborate recreation features of the entire
park are fuHy developed in course
of time. It has been suggested that a
less expensive boat, capable of carrying'from
80 to 100 persons, and operated
by means of a gasoline engine,
\ pulling on a wire cable, might meet the
demands of the public. Such cable ferries
are in general use throughout the
country and have the advantage of giving
good service at small expense. Although
it is settled that the ferry shall
be established at the points indicated,
provided congressional sanction is
given, the details of methods of operation
are subject to further consideration.
.
It is pointed out that a ferry at the
foot of 7th street would provide quick, and
easy means of reaching the heart of the
recreation park from all parts of the
District, through direct connection with
the street cars on*ra?n?r /? ? u/- -*
-? -o rt oucci,
7th street and 11th street, each of which
lines passes the old Alexandria ferry
wharf.
Plan Is Indorsed Strongly.
Gen. Black, Col. Harts, Col. Kutz of
the Engineer Corps and many civilians
are strong advocates of the proposed
terry as a means of opening East Potomac
Park to the public, as otherwise it^
facilities for pleasure and recreation will
be limited mainly to the people who
can drive there or who are willing to
take the long walk from the nearest
available car line.
The park already is a great resort
for automobilists, many of whom during
the summer make a practice of
leaving their cars and walking or
lounging in the cool places along the
river. At times there were as many
; 1 cars parked and empty as there were
I cars in motion in and out of the park.
I As explained by Col. Harts, the small
ferry Is designed mainly as a tempo
rary expedient until better facilities
| gre provided for reaching the park and
j availing of its myriad opportunities for
1 play and recreation. Eventually it is
? fully expected that ample railroad fa1
cilities will be provided for reaching
both East and West Potomac Parks.
In case the ferry service is installed
; by next spring. Col. Harts said, he
would have ready then for visitors at
| least one wing of the big field house,
tx tennis courts and a nine-hole golf
; course, not to speak of other attrac;
tions near the park landing of the
ferry.

ELADENSBURG ROAD
INQUimSSTARTED
0. C. Heads Investigating
Menace of Trolley Poles on
Busy Thoroughfares.
DANGER TO TRAVELERS
TOLD IN POLICE REPORT !
! Smitred hv the rernmmendntinn
? r ~j
of Engineer Commissioner Kutz
and the indorsement of his recom- j
mendation by the Washington- '
Safety First Association and
other civic organizations, the Dis- '
trict Commissioners today started '
what they promise will be an ex- i
haustive investigation into the
menace caused by trolley poles in ,
busy thoroughfares. It was :
learned at the offices of the Com- ,
missioners that efforts will be <
made to have trolley poles removed
from such places, where
they are a menace to lives of
motorists and other travelers i
along busy highways.
Many Motorists Use Road.
The need for such action was empha- :
sized by the fatal accident on the ]
Bladensburg road Tuesday morning: when 1
an automobile struck a pole. As a
result the police are keeping: a strict
watch along: that stretch and a number
of arrests for speeding: were made last
night. The report to police headquarters
is that this road is used by a
large number of motorists entering and
i
leaving Washington, and that it is a .
busy thoroughfare and precautions for (
the safety of these automobilists J
should be taken.
The dangerous location of the poles ?
on the Bladensburg road was also
brought out at the coroner's inquest
last evening inquiring into the fatal ;
collision Tuesday morning. Attention of
the Commissioners has also been di- 1
rected to trolley poles along Connecticut
avenue In the center of the '
thoroughfare by the Chevy Chase Citizens'
Association, which urges that
they be. removed to avoid danger at
intersecting thoroughfares.
D. C. Heads to Take Up
Problem on Finishing
Budget Consideration .
Just now the District Commissioners j
are bending every effort to complete
the annual estimates by October 15, an.d i
have little time for consideration of 1
other matters, but the Bladensburg road 1
problem will be brought up at the ear- j
liest possible moment. It is probable <
that the District heads will look over \
the situation at the intersection of that ;
thoroughfare with 28th street, where
the collision of an automobile with one
of the poles Monday night resulted in
the*death of William M. Schaffer.
It is at this point that the poles shift
from the west to the east side of the
tracks. The municipal authorities, it is j
stated, have installed additional lights
to minimize the danger at this point, ?
but they believe* that the only way en- ,
tirely to eliminate the danger is to ;
cause the removal of the poles and j
their relocation along the curb lines. ,
This would mean the installation of
a Knn t a a monv r?r?1 oc ovaln ?" ?* *? -
in place and would involve considerable
expense.
There is some question as to the au- ,
thority of the Commissioners for sad- \
dling this expense on the railway company.
and this will he one of the* first
matters to be investigated.
A solution of the problem that would
be most satisfactory to the Commissioners
would be a decision by the railway
company to double-track along <
Bladensburg road. In this event there i
would be no objection to a line of
poles between the tracks, and the Commissioners
probably would seek an ap- 3
propriation for widening the street to ;
ninety feet.
The necessary ground for the wld- :
ening of Bladensburg road to ninety '
feet has been acquired, but the Commissioners
do not consider the traffic \
demands necessitate this improvement
being made at the present time. They
believe that the extension of Rhode Is- ]
land avenue to the District line, as :
provided for in the current appropria- '
tion act, will result in considerably '
reducing the traffic over Bladensburg 1
road. !
Arthur C. Smith Is Accused
of Causing Schaffer's Death
by Carelessness in Driving
Arthur C. Smith of 1313 Rhode Island
avenue northwest was held for the action
of the grand Jury by a coroner's jury
{ yesterday afternoon at an inquest as a
i result of the death of William M. Schafi
fer of 501 13th street, who was thrown
' from the former's automobile early Tues!
day morning on Bladensburg road.
J The verdict of the Jury was in part
I that Mr. Schaffer died of a fractured
1 skull and shock, caused by being thrown
j from the automobile driven by Mr. Smith
! and that the Jury "believes the deceased
came to his death by reason of carelessness
on the part of Arthur C. Smith."
Dr. H. H. Nebelette of the Emergency
Hospital testified Mr. Schaffer was taken
1 to the institution in a private automobile
1 about 2:30 o'clock Tuesday morning. He
said he was dead upon arrival there.
Sergt. Sidney L. H. Russell of the
i ninth precinct, who was but a short
distance away at the time of the accli
! dent, testified as to finding SchafTer's
ij body in the road and finding Jesse A.
>; Mann of 931 9th street northeast and
i Marion Baden of 453 I street under
Mr. Mann's automobile, which was
overturned. The witness testified that
| trolley poles are on one aid* of the
street car track from the District line
to the scene of the accident, where
tfiey are on the other side into the city.
Driving Slowly, Smith Testifies.
Mr. Smith testified he was operating
his automobile at a speed of about
eleven or thirteen miles an hour, and
that another automobile was following
him. The witness said a warning was

INDIANA'01 WAY.''
BOTH ICS Ml
Republicans and Democrats
Equally Confident in Predictions
of Victory.
"ROOSEVELT 'LL GET YOU
EF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT"
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
FRENCH LICK, Ind., October 5.?Perhaps
you would like to hear what the
politicians are talking about out here
in Indiana, where the democrats and
republicans are at it "hammer and
tongs" day and night in an effort
'.o elect presidential electors, governor
and state ticket, two United States
senators and representatives in Congress.
They are obliged to talk, because Iniiana
is a close state, because the people
are interested, and lots of them
so "undecided in their minds that it is
incumbent upon the politicians to give
them the best they have in their line
>f argument or special pleading, whichever
you may call it.
How Democrats Argue.
Well, here is the way Senator Tag?art
and Senator Kern talked to a
grroup of democrats, republicans and
progressives in the little hamlets of
Martin county nearby yesterday in a
joint speaking trip they made. This
was way back in the hills, where the
farmers have a little patch of corn in
the valleys and their mules have a list
to starboard as they plow along the
uplands.
"Is there any man among you who
can't get work if he wants it?" asks'
Senator Taggart. "Aren't you getting
better wages and bigger prices than
ever before? Is there any one who
really wants to go to war with Mexico
or any other country? And, in the
name of goodness, what excuse have
vou for asking for a change of government?"
Whereupon, like the man in the song
it the turnpike bar, they "just scratched
their old noils" and looked after the
eight-cylinder car as the candidates
irove away. Senator Taggart and Senitor
Kern think that the decision of
the people on these questions will determine
the election In Indiana, and>
they believe it will be determined in :
favor of the democrats. I Journeyed
from Chicago down here to ask these *
two senators to tell me "honest to
goodness and cross their hearts" the
situation as they view it, believing that
they would tell me If they thought
there was anything wrong with the situation
from a democratic viewpoint.
A.nd they allow as how they don't
think there is.
Sample (J. 0. P. Thunder.
Now hear how the republicans talk.
Fames P. Goodrich, republican candi- I
late for governor, speaking oYpr in
Clay county last night, went after his
opponent, Mr. Adair, in this fashion:
"When I say, Mr. Adair, how do you
ttand on the budget system of appropriations?
He answers: *Stand by the
President.'
"When I ask what have you got to
jay on my plain for abolishing the oil <
inspectors? He answers: Thank God <
ror Wilson.*
"When I ask how he stands on the 1
proposition of prohibiting the salary i
jt any public official to be Increased j
luring the term of his office, he. replies:
Wilson has kept us out of
war.'" i
Then McMurtie, speaking in Brazil,
leclared that the democrats are basTrig }
their appeal for votes on emotions and
not on good business arguments, with
such assertions as are credited to 1
President Wilson. "If the republicans
are elected they will plunge us
Into war."
He spoke principally on the subject
hi laxauon ana snowea now tne re- J
cent laws passed by democratic lefts- .
ta.ture8 have added to the taxes of the
Individual counties of the state. He
said he had found everywhere a pro- J
test against high county taxes, and
pointed out one instance where the 5
money spent on the repair of gravel
roads had increased from $31,000 a
pear to $163,000 a year in the course
of a few years. ,
Col. Boosevelt for Premier P
Next Charles A. Towne, formerly of .
Minnesota, speaking down at Goshen,
quoted from Col. Roosevelt's speech, j
and interpreted it to mean that Roosevelt
stands for war. He went on to
predict that if Hughes is elected i
Roosevelt will be made Secreeary of
State, and that in the event of the Eu- 1
ropean war not being brought to an i
end by that time, the United States 5
would become involved in warfare with j
one and possibly several of the great .
powers. i
President Wilson, T?r. Towne said, j
had succeeded in preserving peace, and ,
for having accomplished this he was (
entitled to the non-partisan support .
of the nation. The President was compared
with Washington and with Lincoln.
The speaker insisted that under
President Wilson more real constructive
and progressive legislation has i
been accomplished than in five times
the period of time under any other
President. 1
By the way, it is reported that the
democratic national management in- .
tends to spring a coup the last few
days of the campaign, too late to have i
it corrected, by charging that if
Hughes is elected Roosevelt will be ,
made Secretary of State, and that the j
Germans will have to look out for ,
squalls.
It is a fact that the democratic national
management believes now that
before the campaign is over the German
vote will suddenly come en masse
to their Hide, as they took the side
against President Wilson at the outset.
Courting German Vote.
Every effort possible is now being
made by the democrats to bring about
this change through some psychological
"drive" at the Germans. Probably
the hardest blow the democrats
have received in this state, however,
was delivered by the Indianapolis
News, an independent paper of supreme
influence in Indiana, containing so
many independent voters. The News
was not enthusiastic for Hughes until
the eight-hour wage bill was forced
through, when it indorsed the stand
Mr. Hughes so promptly took.
The republican leaders of this state
are convinced that the eight-hour wage
coercion sealed the fate of the democratic
party in Indiana, and the best
republican judgment opposed to Senator
Taggart's and Senator Kern's Judgment
is that the state is going for
Hughes, and that both senatorships
will be captured by the republicans.
They argue that as in Maine, where one
senatorial candidate thought to be
much weaker than his party, but was
elected because the republicans wanted
two republican senators, so it will be
in Indiana, and that the candidate assumed
to be less of a favorite will
nevertheless ret the republican vote :
given th^whote ticket and will win.

Missing. *
ST. LOUIS. Mo., October 5.?Fire tolay
destroyed the main building of
Christian Brothers* College here. Two
members of the college faculty are
missing, and are believed to. have perished,
and an assistant nurse, who
lumped from an upper window, was
seriously hurt.
All members of the faculty save two
ind all students were accounted for.
Most of the students had not reached
the college when the fire started.
Their Escape Cut off.
The two missing faculty members are
Brother Cormac, ninety-three years old,
md Brother Clement, seventy-two
years old. Their room on the fifth
floor of the infirmary was swept by
the fire. It is. believed neither could
have escaped.
The assistant nurse who was injured
was Lewis Nolean, who Jumped from
el fifth-story window in the infirmary
is firemen were climbing ladders to
rescue him. His injuries may prove
ratal.
The Are was discovered by the college
registrar as he was walking upstairs
to the room where Brothers Cormac
and Clements were being attended
by Nolean. At that time more than 100
boarding students and thirty or forty
members of the faculty were at breakfast.
The registrar saw flames creeping
across the fifth floor. Students
gathered on the campus saw Nolean
zlimb to the window sill and leap. Two
Bremen had reached the fourth floor on
scaling ladders, but Just then the flames
enveloped Nolean and he leaped to the
lawn ))elow.
Trouble Getting Water.
The building destroyed was a sixstory
structure. Apparently the Are
started on the fourth or fifth floor near
the elevator shaft, and spread quickly.
The college building was a block
from the nearest water plugs and firemen
were delayed in getting streams
of water on the blaze. Water pressure
also was inadequate, due to the fact
that the building was on a high elevation.
The sacred vessels in the college
chapel were rescued by brothers. The
natural history and curio museum in
the corridor was destroyed. This museum
was started by Brother Cormac,
believed to hgive perished in the fire.
About noon the fourth floor of the
college building collapsed and seven
to twenty firemen plunged to the basement.
Three were taken out badlv injured.
Others are in the wreckage.

THE NATIONAL CHAIRME
WOMEN IN A RIOT,
CLAMOR FOR MILK
?
Many of Them Carrying
Babies, They Storm Two
Stations in Harlem.
TODAY'S SUPPLY SHORTER
THAN EVER, IS ASSERTED
NEW YORK, October 5.?The first
disorder growing: out of the milk situation
took place here early today, when
it was necessary to call police reserves
to disperse more than 500 women,
mostly foreigners, many with babies
in arms, who stormed two health department
milk stations in Harlem.
The women had previously canvassed
stores in the neighborhood in search
of milk for their children, and, finding
none for sale, they gathered at the city
stations. A few were admitted. Those
on the outside, fearing that the supply
would be exhausted before they could
be served, rushed the doors of the
building.
Officers In charge of the stations'
said that their supply today was less j
than half of that received yesterday.
Look to State Inquiry,
Efforts to compromise the controversy
between the milk producers and
the city distributers having failed, consumers
today pinned their hopes upon
tn? state investigation, which is to
begin before a referee here tomorrow.
Some indication of a possible settlement
also was seen in an offer by one
of the big distributers to give the
farmers an advance of 35 cents per 100
pounds over the prices heretofore prevailing.
The Dairymen's League insists
upon an advance of 45 cents a huhdred
pounds. It was rumored that one of the 1
distributers had decided to withdraw
from the conference over the price and
mak^ a separate peace with the producers.
There is a shortage of about one-half
in the city's dally supply, and it is
stated that one of the big distributers
is receiving only about one-third the
normal quantity of milk. Dealers asserted
there was no danger of a famine.
Representatives of the Dairymen's
League said the city supply was shorter
today than ever.
Upstate Rioting Continues.
From upstate counties and New Jersey
came news of more rioting arid raids by
farmers upon the milk stations or milk
wagons. Masked night riders again held
up and dumped milk in transport to
railroad stations. The farmers said hundreds
of new members were joining the
league, and that their position was
stronger than ever.
Only about 50 per cent of the normal
supply of milk was received in Jersey
City today, which was so distributed
that children and others in actual need
were served first. Police officers have
made a house-to-house canvass to ascertain
the number of children and sick
persons depending upon milk.
Big Milk Company Yields.
A milk company which supplies onefifth
of all the milk sold in this city
announced late today that it would
meet the demands of the Dairymen's
League for an increase in the prices
paid to farmers of 45 cents per 100
pounds.
The announcement was made by H.
N. Hallock, vice president of the company.
He said his concern had concluded
to grant the demand of the
Dairymen's League because it considered
"the babies of New York first and
the Interests of the milk companies
second."
Mr. Hallock said that notices of the
company's surrender have already been
dispatched to agents of the company
throughout the state.

values discussed
.... - -</&.
Experts at the Southwick
False Advertising Trial
Testify as to Grades.
Some Palm Beach suits are known
to haberdashers as "truck," while
others ark known as "first class," it
all depends on the manufacture of the
suit, shrinking of the cloth, etcl, according
to expert testimony at the
second day's trial of Henry G. Southwick
as. an individual and as secretary
and treasurer of the Southwick Shops,
Inebrnorated. in the Polioe Cnnrt tn.
day on a charge of violation of the
false advertising law. '
Isidor Grosner of 1013 Pennsylvania
avenue testified the suit which Constants
E. La Vigne testified yesterday
he purchased at the Southwlck Shops
for $4.85 and was represented to him
as being of $12 value was one of the
"truck" suits. He said it was not
worth more than $5. Comparing the
suit with another, the witness pointed
out the difference in them, as to why
one would sell for more than the
other, although they are both of the
same material.
He testified the additional cost would
be as to whether or not the cloth is properly
shrunk, the trimmings, cut and general
workmanship. "Well shrunken cloth,
the trimmings and cutting." the witness
testified, "makes the higher value."
Cost of Manufacture.
On cross-examination the witness said
some Palm Beach suits may be worth
$10, if made by a certain manufacturer.
He explained that 'it cost more for some
manufacturers to get out such a suit because
they have expert cutters, who demand
higner pay; also that better trimmings
are placed on the suit, and that
the cloth has been shrunk.
When asked if he conducted another
store in this city where such suits were
sold las^ summer for $5 which were
declared to be worth $10 the witness
testified he did not. He said he is the
owner of the store and has a manager
for it. and that if such a thing was
done he did not know. it. "I would not
have permitted it to be done," said the
w'itness, "if I knew of it."
Louis Hirsch of 912 F street, who
said he had been engaged in the haberdashery
business for twenty-five
years, also explained to the jury the
difference in the two suits. He also
detailed why one would cost more than
the other, and therefore must be sold
at a higher figure.
Mr. La Vigne was recalled to the
stand by the government to identify
the better grade suit. He explained
that he purchased it in Baltimore from
the manufacturer and testified it was
sold at $6 wholesale, to be retailed at
$8.50. The witness said that if the suit
were sold at a higher price than $8.50
it would not be fair to the public.
Government Closes Case.
The government closed its case at this
i - * utnmAv "Frank Smith for the
pom u *????...?, ??
defense made a motion that the court
direct the Jury to return a verdict of
"not guilty." He declared the law was
passed .as the, result of so much "fake
auction" business here, when jewelry,
represented as gold, was sold, whereas
it was not gold. He said further that
the case on trial is not a matter of
misrepresentation, but a matter of
opinion, and presented authorities to
support his contention.
Judge Mullowny overruled the motion.
Court , then adjourned for lunch.
James E. North, a shirt manufacturer
of Baltimore, testified yesterday afternoon
that his company sold shirts like
that which Mr. L,a Vigne said was represented
to him as of $2.50 value, by
a clerk in the Southwlck store, at 57c
wholesale and gave the highest retail
value at $1.
Eugene Oott of this city testified
the tie alleged to be silk and of the
value of 60 cents by the Southwick
Shops, was a mixture of silk and cotton
and that 26 cents was a high valuation.
L. B- Barschkies and George
A. MoCatherlne, silk experts, corroborated
the testimony of Mr. Oott,

OMAHA, Neb., October B.?Nebraska's
commemoration of her fifty years of
statehood was brought to a climax today
with the visit of President Wilson
to take part in the celebration of the !
semi-centennial.
A cheering crowd of thousands of
people gathered from all parts of Nebraska
and neighboring states and
greeted the President on his arrival
and continued the applause as he
passed through the streets in an automobile.
A non-partisan committee officially
welcomed the President and
Mrs. Wilson. The President immediately
entered into the spirit of the
occasion. Bands of Indians and of
cowboys were here to participate in
the parade. It was estimated fully
100,000 persons lined the streets.
Starting with the President's arrival
at 11:40 a.m., Mr. Wilson's program included
a short address at a noon
luncheoiv of the Omaha Commerical
Club, riding with Mrs. Wilson at the
head of the historical pageant, and an
address in the evening at the municipal
auditorium.

4'salient neiore me wury.
He received noisy welcomes from
many thousand persons in Ohio, Indiana
and Illinois yesterday. He interpreted
the enthusiasm in one crowd as meaning
"You believe in me." At stop after
stop the railroad stations were packed;
at several places bands played, and frequently
the President remarked on the
cordiality.
Refusing to turn his trip into a
speech-making tour, the President,
nevertheless, kept up a running fire of
remarks at every stop. Interest among
those who spoke to him centered TOOft
about the eight-hour law for railroad
employes. . The
President appeared on the rear
platform of his private car* waved to
the crowds, explained that hi was making
no speeches and then Shook hands
with as many as possible.
"I am before the jury and can't say
anything." was the way he explained
hfa failure to speak in several towns.
"I am not making a speech-making
campaign," said the President at Lima,
Ohio, "but it touches me and gratifies
me very much to get the greetings I
have all along the line, and Ohio has
certainly shown her hospitality."
"We didn't want a speech; we wanted
to see our President," a man called out.
"I don't think much of my speechmaking,
but I think it is better than I
am to look at," Mr. Wilson said.
They Ask for Mrs. Wilson.
"We want to see Mrs. Wilson," a man
shouted.
"I'll admit she is better worth looking
at than I am," replied the President
as he brought his wife forward.
"I heard a republican say today he
was going to vote for you," a man
called out at Wooster, Ohio.
"W? mnot hp a cnnH man." rpfnrtpH
Mr. Wilson.
"You were with us in the eight-hour
day and we are with you," said a man
at Orrville, Ohio, a railroad town.
"Good." the President replied.
When the President stopped at Valparaiso,
Ind., a crowd, including some
students, drew him into a reference to
Mr. Hughes* whiskers.
"I haven't any speech to make," said
Mr. Wilson. "I have never met you
before, but your manners are very familiar.
I am glad to see you."
A man in the crowd called out,
"Aren't we glad he hasn't got whiskers
!"
"You are a clean-shaven crowd yourself."
replied the President.
At Fort Wayne, the first stop in In*
dlana, Mr. Wilson said: "I haven't anything
to say, my fellow citizens, except
that it is exceedingly refreshing
to get away from official duties and
out among the folks again, and the sort
of greeting you are giving me fills my
heart with a great deal of gratitude. I
am heartily obliged to you."
A railroad brakeman. just off duty,
pushed out his hand afid said: "Right'
there, Mr. President. She's dirty, but
she's going to hit the rooster hard."
Predicts Success in Indiana.
At Warsaw, Ind., the President said:
"It cheers me very much to have you
come out and give me such a greeting,
because sometimes when I am hard at
| work I long very much to get away and
come out and see the folks. It gives me
the deepest gratitude, as if you wanted
to see me and believe in me. God
bless you and good luck to you."
Edward G. Hoffman of Fort Wayne,
democratic national committeeman
from Indiana, rode for a while with the
President, and later gave out an informal
statement, in which he claimed
that Indiana would cast its electoral
vote for Wilson.
"The President has a large personal
following among Indiana republicans."
Mr. Hoffman said. "The independent
vuie is ior mm souaiy, ana ne 18 a8t ;
sured of 35 per cent of the progressive
votes. Our citizens do not believe in
swapping horses in the middle of the
stream."
Mr. Wilson made a brief stop at Chicago
last night and conferred with
Senator Walsh, in charge of democratic
western headquarters; Senator Saulsbury
of Delaware, manager of the senatorial
committee and other department
heads.
Several hundred persons, including
local politicians, railroad men, and not
a few fomen. flocked to the train
yards and cheered the President when
he appeared and shook hands with
those nearest him.
Senator Walsh told him the campaign
in the west was "more than satisfactory."
