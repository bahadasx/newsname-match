A young man's bank book is an indication that lie is under
real headway.
The young man with a bank account is already "getting on"
in the world. It indicates prosperity and habits of industry and
business that augur well for his future.
And it is a testimony not only to tangible possessions but to
personal qualities that have much to do with winning the admira
tion and confidence of acquaintances.

MORGAN TALKS TO VOTERS,
Diet T. Morgan, Congressman and
candldntc for re-election, was in Bea
ver County last week speaking to the
voters at various places He talked to
the voters of this vicinity at Beaver
Thursday night, and In the course of
his remarks left many good thoughts
for their careful consideration, and
which should help them in casting
their ballots in the coming election for
the best interest or this section Con
gressman Morgan lias so long repre
sented this district in Congress and
did It ko faithfully aud consistently
that there is every reason why he
should continue, to do so and no good
reason why the voters should not sup
port f.im for anothur term. It takes a
long time to so get in touch with the
workings of our federal government ns
to be able to accomplish much in tho
way of legislation, but Morgan has
been on tho Job long enough now and
stands so high in the estimation of hi
colleagues that lie has been able to
pilot come mighty good measures
through Congress and is' In a position
to render jiM as valuable or bettor
Service in the iulure. It would be fol
ly to make a change at this time. Vote
for Morgan and you vote for the best
interest of this district.

AYERS' CANDIDACY FOR COUNTY
PERINTENDENT.
In the announcement column this
week may be found the card ol G. T.
Ayers, who Is asking re-election for a
second term to the olllce of County
Superintendent Mr. Ayers haB served
the people in that capacity the past
two years, and we feel that we are
voicing the sentiment of the people
in general when we say that he has dis
charged tho d.utis of his office In a
tglrafghlforward and capable manner.
The ofllao of Superintendent of
Schools is a hard one to fill, and one
which requires not only ability, but
good judgment as well. The manner
in which Superintendent Ayers has
handled the many perplexing and tur
bulent school questions that have come
up for his disposal, as well as the reg
ural routine work of the office, has
proven that he is possessed of both
ability and good judgment, and is in
every way qualified for the office, and
we feel that he Is entitled to re-election.
It is said, ''One good turn de
serves another." We believe it would
b justns applicable to say, "One good
term deserves another," and the voters
could not do better than to re-elect
Mr. Ayers for a second term.

BEATTY FOR COURT CLERK.
The announcement .of L. F. Beatty,
democratic candidate for Court Clerk,
may be found in the announcement
column of The Herald. In asking the
support of the voters in his caudidaey,
Mr. Beatty docs so, promising in re
turn Mr llPRt nfTnrta tn tluhnrrtn thu
many important duties of that Impor
tant office in a capable and satisfactory
manner. He feels that he is qualitled
tor the office he seeks, and that if elect
ed to serve the people the coming term
that they will not have reason to re
gret their choice. He has had consid
erable experience in clerical work, and
has been issociflted in different lines
of business which required careful and
accurate atttention. His success tn
these things Is proof of his ability, and
this, together with his recognized char
acteristics of honesty and integrity,
makes him a candidate in whom the
voters may safely put their trust.
While a candidate on a political ticket
not in accord with our belief, yet, we
do not hesitate to recommend Mr.
Beatty as a condidate worthy of support.
OUR ENTIRE WHEAT AND OAT CROP
REQUIRED TO DEFRAY EXPENSES
OF DEMOCRATIC STATE GOV
ERNMENT. The cost of government to the peo
plo of Oklahoma last year wbb over
toO.OOO.OOO. A rough estimate of ap
propriations and estimated expenses
of goternment for this year reaches
tnO.OOOOOO. This means tho com
bined value of our wheat and oat
crops 22 per cent of the total produc
tion of this state, including all agri
cultural, oil and mining products.
This is a result of a policy that has
continually increased the cost of gov
ernment to this state. The llrst ter
ritorial Jeglsfature appropriated IP.',
100, the first state legislature W,S23 -3J3.33,
and the last legislature $10,
530,246 33 or state government vTlio
year prior to statehood the court ex
penses of the Territory, aside from
justice court, was $308,800 seven dis
tricts judges and twenty-six county
Judges preformed this work. The
court expenses last year for the ter
ritory comprising old Oklahoma, ox
elusive offJustice court, was 11,064,471,
fmj sevenjeen district judges, thirty-'
eight county judges, one-half of a
supremo oourt of seventeen members,
a federal district court and twelve
United States Commissioners perform
ed the work. In addition there have
been created since statehood a corpor
ation commission, an industrial com
mission, court of Inquiry, referee
courts, and various oxecutlvo otllcers
have been clothed with judicial power.
Tho expenses of county government
for the twenty-six counties comprising
old Oklahoma Territory the year prior
to statehood was $1,000,000; the aggre
gate cost of county goernment for
the same territory divided into thirty-
eight counties was last year $5,000,000.
The result is felt by every industry
in the state. The number of mort
gages on farms, homes and business
that have been foreclosed has been
multiplying year after year. There
are today UO.OOO tenant farmers and
05,000 farm owners in Oklahoma.
Desplto aSnnparallid 'and Unnatural
prosperity, tho number of business
failures Increases and, our big InBtitu
tions and industries are suffering by
reason of the burdens that have been
placedupon them under pretext of
regulation, regardless of the fact that
a great majority of the largest corpor
ations can pass these burdens on to
their employes and tho public.
Isn't it about time to commence
curtailing expenses and elect men to
office who have n, broader ambition
than gaining political aggrandizement
by the wholesale distributive of poli
tical pie through useless offices
created to give some hanger-on a Job?

The Truax Undertaking Company,
of this city, were called Mouday to
take charge of the body of Frank Uix
ler, a young man who had resided at
his home near Forgan, and who passed

was operated upon at a Wichita hospi

throat, but failed to obtain relief, and
died as a result of that trouble. The
many friends of the family are grieved
to learn of the untimely death of this
young man, and extend sincere sym
pathy to the sorrowing ones.

BEAVER COUNTY WHEAT WINS FIRST
PLACE AT STATE FAIR.
Beaver County wheat made tho rest

the State Fair last week, when a Bam
pie which was exhibited by J. W
Gambs, manager of the Farmers' Equi
ty Exchange, at Knowles, carried off
first prize over all other counties of
the State. How Ib that for old Iieaver
County? The thanks of the entire cit
izenship of the cpunty is due Mr.
Gambs for Ills personal interest in ex
hibiting our wheat at the State Fair,
Had it not been for his efforts, our
excellent wheat would have doubtless
never been brought to the attention of
the public It has long been true that
Heaver County wheat wbb tho beat pro
duced in the Southwest, but that fact
has not been spread before the public
as It should havo been. We should all
take off our hats to Mr. Gambs.
