At tho snme time. It Is stated, two

A dispatch from Now York to Tho

Wearing n simple gown of black voile

of the noise.
On one occasion she was greeted by

LONDON, Oct. S Advices
from Bucharest deny that Aus
trian monitors destroyed the
Danube bridge over which the
Roumanians crossed into Bul
garia, said a Rome dispatch to
the Wireless News Agency to
day. SOFIA, Oct . 5. Bulgarian troops
have enveloped and destroyed fifteen
or sixteen Roumanian battalions (about
15,000 men) which crossed the Danube
and Invaded Bulgaria near Rtohovo,
said an official statement from the war
office today.
Tho defeat suffered by the Rou
manians Is the greatest slnco the de
struction of the Roumanian army at
the fortress of Tutrakan, when 13,000
Roumanians wero trapped and captured
south of tho Danube. ,
The Roumanians were caught by an
encircling movement and began to
stream back across the river without
offering stubborn oppostllon. Teutonic
monitors naa smashed some or tho
pontoon bridges over which tho In
vaders crossed, thus Interfering seri
ously with their retreat to the north
bank.
Much Booty Taken.
Bulgarian artillery was trained on
Roumanian transports that attempt
ed to facilitate the retreat, adding to
the confusion In the ranks of the en
emy. The exact number of prisoners
is not aennueiy Known, nut it is re
ported .that large quantities of war
material wore brought In.
On the DobrudJa front, all Russo
Roumanian attacks were frustrated.
The German war offlco yesterday
afternoon announced that the Rou
manian force that crossed the Danube
had rstreated before n German- Bul-
gar encircling movement.
Second Severe Defeat.
If the Bulgarian statement' Is true,
the Roumanians have suffered two
most severe defeats on the Danube In
the Ave weeks since they entered the
war. When German and Bulgarian
forces captured the Roumanian fort
ress of Tutrakan, the Roumanian gar
rison was surrounded on the south
bank and captured. Several hundred
Roumanians, Including a general and
a number of other officers were
drowned while attempting to swim
the Btream.
The Gorman war office, however de
clared that the Roumanians "escaped
bv hast flight."
Tho Roumanians had occupied several
Bulgarian villages beforo they wero at
tacked by Bulgarian forces from Rust-

Despite Official Denials, He As

Considered.
NEUTRALS CREDIT RUMOR
Negotiations Broken Off After
Meeting In Kovno During
Past August.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
United Press Staff Correspondent
THE HAGUE, Sept. 16 (by
mail). Despite official denials
that Russia and Germany recently
discuss6d a separate peace, I havo
learned from recent visits to War
saw, Copenhagen and The Hague
that some sort of a conference did
take place.
At present, however, there is
little prospect that Russia wiil de
sert jhe allies.
j-Rounianfa's .intervention in trio
war has changed the. situation en
tirely from the Czar's standpoint.
REPORT PUBLISHED.
The report that a peace meeting waa
held at Kovno was published recently In
the Nleuwo Courant, ono of the best
Informed newspapers of Holland.
Tho Courant article has not been pub
lished In any belligerent country, It Is
understood here, though It created a
Bcnsatlon In Holland and the neutral
Scandinavian countries.
Immediately following Its publication,
the Russian legation here Issued a de
nial. Similar denial was telegraphed
from Berlin, but, regardless of this fact
officials In Scandinavian countries be
llevo a great deal of the Courant article
Is true.
The Courant asserted that special rep
resentatives of tho Czar and Premier
Sturmer met tho Kaiser and Field Mar
shal von Hlndenburg at Kovno In
August. Exactly what caused the nego
tiations to be broken off waa not learn
ed. Why Conference Ended.
One report was that Russia learned
that Roumanla was about to enter
the war. Another report was that
Emperor Franz Josef had refused to
cede Gallcla and Bukowlnn to Rus
sia, the prlco demanded by the Czar
for a soparato peace.
Russia was said to be willing to
make a separate peace becauso sho
was afraid of Japanese aggression In
China, because General BrusllofTa of
fensive had failed to capture Lerq
berg and Kovel, nnd because the al
lies had not given her successful co
operation on other fronts.
Germany, according to a noutral In
The Hague, was willing to seo thnt
Turkey made some concessions to
Russia regarding the Dardanelles.
Poland was to be mado a kingdom,
with a bIIco of Gallcla added, under
Prlnco Leopold of Bavaria.
