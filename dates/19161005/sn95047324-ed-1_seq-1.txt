.Washington, An interesting dis

was something like a million years
ago has just been made public by
the United States Geological Sur
vey and those who like to dig into
the relics of the past will no doubt
be pleased to know what the Gov
ernment is doing. This statement
is as follows:
"A change of climate is suppos
ed to account for the shrinkage of i
Alaska glaciers, for the disappear
ance of those clever stone masons
whose handiwork is found in the
midst of Mexican jungles, and for
many other things. - Great chang

"The Kuhtronical or warm tern

Western Florida was cooler than
that of the preceding period,
