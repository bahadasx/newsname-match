FAIN^ CRIES. FOR HELP AND
SMOKE FROM FIRE BRING
RANGER
t(r%ilGUE.
Lost in the vast woods north of
Lake Superior and without food for
five days, an aged man finally made
his cries heard and rescuers were
guided to him by smoke from a fire.
The story of the rescue is told brief
ly in a copy of the diary of P. J. Bay-
--lief
acting state ranger in the Grand
Marais district, received at the state
forestry offices at the Capitol.
"Wild Looking Sight."
"The old twulti when we came upon
trim was a wild looking sight, his hair
flying and his clothes all ragged from
his wanderings through the thick
"brush," said the diary. "He had not
even a knife and his escape is little
short of miraculous.
"The old fellow is a Russian and
speaks little English. We fed him
and took him to an abandoned cabin,
where we stayed, over night. He
peemed like a good old soul and very
grateful for his rescue.
Hcfor Faint ~Cries.
The ranger first heard faint cries
for help when he was on the wefct ^niK
sfGunfiint lake, in a ftU ie^on, an-!
again at his lunch, airf$nally a col
tUnn of smoke enabled htin to locate
the lost man.
It was the second rescue reported
-giis summer byRahger Baylie.
Vi
Early Monday morning the eastern
limit of the switch yarids of the G..&
By., at Lakota was the scene of a
bold hold-up by three gunmen who
•covered four men who were returning
east from threshing operations up tin
branch line, and relieved them of over
$300. Two of the robbers, covered the
men with three revolvers while the
"third man went through their pockets,
after which the victims were locked
in a box car and" admonished that if
they mad an outcry their bodies would
be riddled with bullets. They were
not discovered until next morning and
in the meantime the robbers had
made good their get-away.

RECALL PERSHING
OR FACE A FIGHT
FIRST CHIEF IMPATIENT AT DE
LAY OF WILSON AND IS READY
TO USE FORCE TO OUST THE
Washington, Oct. 3.—Administra
tion officials fear that Carranza is
about to issue an ultimatum, with a
definite time limit, demanding the im
mediate withdrawal of Pershing's ex
pedition in Mexico.
Carranza Ready to Fight.
From the soupces which afforded of.
ficials this information, it was learned
that a refusal by Wilson to submit to
this order would be replied to by Car
ranza with military force.
Carranza, it is understood, is cha
fing over President Wilson's delay in
ordering the American, troops out of
Mexico while the Mexican and Amer
ican commissions are holding session's
at Atlantic City.
Given To Aredondo.
Of particular significance is the re
cent departure of Eliseo Aredondo,
Mexican ambassador designate, to
Mexico City.
The belief here is that the first
chief recalled him in order to give
into his haiids the expected ultimatum.
Reports printed in the Spanish news
papers in El Passo today were that
the ultimatum would be delivered to
the United States in twenty-four
hours.

Meanwhile the administration has
learned that European powers are not

contemplate taking their share of the
Mexican muddle into their own hands.
Will Protect Interests.
The British and French embassies
it was learned today, have called the
attention of Secretary of State Lan
sing to the Carranza government':
seizure of British'and French banking
institutions in Mexico City.
They have made it clear that they
will protect their interests there.._
Hope In Commission.
The purpose of the administration
apparently is to keep, the Mexican
American joint commission in confer
ence as long as possible in the hope
that this will ward off a renewal of
the recent situation when the two
countries were on the eve of a declar
ation of war.

Mr. Hill predicted that the next car

kind ever held in the United States.
While in the West Mr. Hill received
the pledge of the famous Roundup as
sociation of Pendleroy, Mont., that its
entire board of twelve directors would
come to the carnival and each man on
horse back. With South St. Paul, it
will be the second mounted club in
the carnival.

Washington, Oct. 4.—Another re
port of the capture of the German
merchant submarine Bremen reached
officials here today from unofficial but
usually reliable sources.
According to the account, which is
given credence by some high military
officers, the Bremen was seen three
weeks ago at the big British station
at Rosyth, on the east coast of Sot
land.
Caught In Steel Net.
It had been captured in one of the
steel nets recently used with such suc
cess by Great Britain against under
water craft.
More than seventy submarines are
said to have been taken or destroyed
by these nets.
Agents Still Confident.
In spite of persistent reports of the
Bremen's capture, its agents in this
country apparently still are confident
that it is safe on the high seas and
will appear at New London, Conn in
due time.

HOGGING DOWN CORN
The hogs at the North Dakota Ex
periment station are husking their
own corn. The flint varieties were
mature enough to begin "hogging
down" nearly two weeks ago. At the
Edgeley Sub-station corn is also being
"hogged down". In previous trials In
hogging down corn at the North Da
kota experiment station the hogs have
given returns averaging $30.00 per
iSfcroiSfiito haVb lftttHMfeln com
paring the returns from -"hogged
down", as compared to corn husked
and fed the hogs. The best returns
have been given b^ the hogs helping
themselves to the "corn. This saves
the work of husking and hauling the
corn to the hogs.
When the corn is "hogged down",
such early maturing varieties as the
Gehu and Squaw corn can be prrown.
These would be a little difficult to
husk due to the ears being so close to
the ground, and they can not be hand
led by machinery for the same season.
Growing such varieties make it pos
sible to start the corn feeding earlier
than would be possible with the lar
ger varieties of corn. In this way
"hogging down" corn lengthens the
corn feeding season before the cold
weather.

While W. J. Bryan showed his au
dience that he still has the ability to
show the people a fine sample of ora
tory, in his speech here last Thursday
afternoon, but those who attended
were much disappointed in the argu
ments he presented for the party
which he claims to represent. Really,
he had no argument at all. There
was a fair sized audience here to greet
him and listen to him, but why mis
represent the facts and say that there
were thousands here. As a matter of
fact our local opera house holds less
than a thousand people, and there was
room in it for all and yet it was not
filled to its capacity. There were'
probably in the neighborhood of 1,000
people heard him, and it is a fair es
timate to say that two-thirds of those
present were women and girls. As
one listener stated after the speech,if
Mr. Bryan had no better argument
than the ones he presented here for
his party that his talks would make
votes' for the Republican party.
