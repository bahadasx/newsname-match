Twas Ever Thut
Just when u fellow does u piece of
work that hes particularly proud of
along comes some joy killer and drops
a fly in his ointment Omer Webb
whose fertilizer nils have afforded The
News readers many 11 heary laugh
wrote his ud lust week and entitled it
Shall tuskers Adorn the White
House The printer may have been
out late the night before or his morn
ing pancakes rested a little heav ily on
his stomach or it may have been the
rush on Wednesday morning when
the ad was set that caused a line from
the copy to be omitted and the ud
didnt say what Omer wrote Omer
had a right to be sore und he availed
himself of his right The ud is repeut
ed this week by reijuest
Took the Editor for a Cow Sur
geon
The editor of this paper has been ta
kenor mistaken for a preacher a
bnrber a lawyer and a streetcar con
ductor but never fora horse doctor un
til last Friday out at Kings sale when
a young farmer stepped up and solicit
ed our services to cut a lump from his
cows jaw We were somewhat taken
back by the request but managed to
say that wedid not havcourinstrmcnts
along und would go right to town and
get our scissors and pastepotand try to
save the cows life At this point it
appeared that the young man thought
he was talking to Dr Houscr and to
whom he promised to apologise
Almost Lost Eye
During the wind storm last Wednes
day some glass flew into the left eye of
Miss Minnie Corder when the glass
door of the school room in which she

Miss Minnie but it is believed now
that her eyesight will not be impaired
