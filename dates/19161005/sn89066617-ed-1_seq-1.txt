Cape Woman Came From

ILL A YEAB AFTER
PABALYTIC STBOKE
Four Sons and Sister Survive
Was Married in Cape
in 1869.
Mrs. Sophia Hennecke, who has been
a resident of the Cape since 1861, died
at 11 o'clock last night at her home,
145 South Frederick street, as a re
sult of a hemorrhage of the brain that
she suffered four hours earlier. She
had been ill for more than a year with
heart trouble and last spring suffered
a stroke of paralysis that nearly be
came fatal.
Mrs. Hennecke, although she had
been ill for the last year, was able to
be up and she did much of the house
work at her home.
Tuesday she was seriously ill, but
yesterday she felt much improved dur
ing the day. She had been forced to
remain abed for most of the time fol
lowing the stroke of paralysis last
spring, but yesterday afternoon she
got up and sat in a chair. She was
forced to return to her bed at 5:20
o'clock, however, and at 7 o'clock she
suffered the cerebral hemorrhage.
Her physicians were powerless to aid
her thereafter, and the attack made
her unconscious. She sank rapidly
from that time on, and at 11 o'clock,
when all the members of the family
except one son who lives in the coun
try were present, she passed away.
She was 66 years old on Tuesday,
September 26, last, and was born in
Hanover, Germany. She came over to
America in 1861 when the Civil War
was opening, and immediately after
her arrival here, she came to the Cape.
Eight years later she was married
to Christopher Hennecke, who died
three years ago. One of their sons,
Herman Hennecke, died in 1901, and
the children who survive her are: Ed
ward Hennecke, who is in charge of
a lunch stand in Gross & Ruh bar on
Good Hope street; Martin, William
and Emil Hennecke.
All the sons reside in the Cape ex
cept William Hennecke, who is on a
farm near Gordonville. She also is
survived by a sister, Mrs. Carolina
Rupert, who has resided in the Cape
at the home of George Fedder, railroad
mail clerk working" out of the Cape.
Last night no funeral arrangements
had been made. Mrs. Hennecke was 3
member of Trinity German Lutheran
Church. '"m
MORTGAGE TO ENGLAND
IS SOCIALISTS' FEAR
Berne, Oct. 4. In a strongly cen
sured editorial the Milan newspaper,
Avanti, the central organ of the Italian
Socialists, demands that the Govern
ment conform or deny the rumors that
the loans granted to Italy by England
for war purposes had to be secured by
mortgages on railroads and custom re
ceipts. The paper states that sums
advanced by England to the Italian
Government are nearing the billion
dollar mark and it expresses the fear
that this enromous debt may turn Italy
into a British dependency.
Committing on the article, the Bund
says:
"Portugal is already completely
mortgaged to England and France and
Italy will be in almost the same posi
tion soon. No matter how the war
ends, England is sure to win, because
her present allies will be so deeply in
debted to her that in the future they
cannot do anything without permission
from London."

BEET SUGAR TO SHOW
STRIKING INCREASE
Denver, Colo., Oct 4. Beet sugar
factories are just beginning their an
nual operations. Owing to the high
price of sugar the output will be much
larger than last year. The civic and
commercial association reported today
that there are 225,000 acres sown to
sugar beets in Colorado alone, against
160,000 acres last year. The produc
tion is estimated at 2,900,000 short
tons, against 1,820,000 a year ago,
while the value will rise from $33,000,
600 to ?50,000,000
A move to abolish the office of Coun
ty Highway Engineer which is occu
pied by Dennis Scivally yesterday was
quashed by the County Court when
it hung the proposition on a spike.
A petition to have the road engi
neer's job pruned from the county's
payroll was filed some time ago m
the office of County Clerk Blucher
Sperling. It contained 441 names.
When the County Court took the pe
tition under consideration an investi
gation was made to learn what would
be the power of the petitioners. Un
der the State Statutes, Section No.
10571, it is set forth that 10 per cent
of the voters of the county must sign
the petition to do away with the posi
tion of Highway Engineer, before the
question may be submitted by the
County Court to a vote of the people.
Under that provision it was declared
that a petition would have to have at
least 600 names of voters before it
could get consideration. And for the
reason that the petition was insuffi
cient, its prayer was denied.
The County Court yesterday drew
the jurymen for the November term of
the Common Pleas Court who are as
follows: Applecreek township, Theo.
E. Kasten, Charles Gross and C. J.

stolz zoo on South Middle street, by

CITY APPEALS ITS
TRAFFIC ORDINANCE
Will Test Snider's Opinion in a
Higher Court Other
News.
Judge John A. Snider's ruling in
Common Pleas Court in which he
knocked out the provisions of the city's
ordinance on traffic and stopping ve
hicles in the Ftreets, yesterday was ap
pealed to the St. Louis Court of Ap
peals by City Counselor O. A. Kne
hans. Judge Snider declared the traffic or
dinance unrealizable and unconstitu
tional for cities of the third class, in
his decision handed down several days
ago in the trial of a complaint against
G K. Tinsley, who was arrested and
fined in Police Court for stopping and
standing his auto in the middle of the
street.
Tinsley appealed the case to the
Common Pleas Court where he won it.
and on the instructions of Mayor
Kage, Knehans yesterday prepared to
appeal.
The traffic ordinance as it now
stands on the books of the city is
modelled after the ordinances in St.
Louis and Springfield, Mo., where they
are considered by jurists to be models.
Knehans and the Mayor also contend
that the State laws give the city the
right to make an ordinance such as the
Cape now has.
In taking the appeal, Judge Snider
declined to give the city credit forhe
$10 appeal fees and Knehans furnish
ed the funds for the appeal out of his
own pocket.
A motion also was filed in Common
Pleas Court yesterday to allow a non
suit in the Dyer $10,000 carnage suit
against the Frisco which was taken
from the .iury last week by the Judge
and a verdict for a railroad ordered,
the Judge declaring that the attorneys
for the plaintiff failed to make a case.
A non-suit may be taken under the
law at any time before a case is al
lowed to go to a jury. In this suit, al
though the suit was decided, it was
decided on the orders of the court and
the attorneys for Mrs. Dyer assert
that the issues never have gone be
fore a jury for its consideration and
for that reason a non-suit is possible.
In the event that the Judge, who re
served his opinion till later, allows the
non-suit, the damage suit against the
Frisco will be brought in a different
manner.

by reason of the destruction of the
plate-glass window in tha front of S.

The lawyer and the autoist got out

The car that did the damage at the

the plate-glass window. Miller paid

started back toward his home. B.iin
