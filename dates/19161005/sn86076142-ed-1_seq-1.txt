the world war has been tranaf erred
to the Russian, Rumanian and Mace
donian fronts, on all of which heavy
fighting Is in progress.
The fierce battle which has been
raging fur several days west of
Lutsk, in Volhynia, la still without
decisive reaulta for either side, while
p Oalicla aloug the Zlota-Liua river,
where the Russians are trying to
push through to Lemberg, the Austro
Gertnan forces are still holding back
the Russians. Berlin in its official
account of the fighting near Lutsk
says the Russian dead numbers
thousands.
Bucharest is still silent with regard
to the operations of Rumania's
troops, which crossed the Danube
river betweea Rusticbuk and Turtu-
kal and Invaded Bulgarian territory,
but Berlin says these men have been
hastily withdrawn In the fear of
being encircled by the forces of Field
Marshal von Mackensen.
Fresh gains by the Rumanians
against the renter and left wing of
the Teutonic allies operating to the
north of Dobrudja are chronicled by
Bucharest. At Amzacea, a position
of the Teutons was captured and with
It more than 10UO men and seven
guns and much. war material.
In Transylvania, from Orsova, on
the Danube, near the Hungarian
Rumanian frontier, to the Bukowlna
border numerous engagements have
been fought. Bucharest claims suc
cesses for the Rumanian arms In the
region of Odorkim, between Fogares
and Sighiscara, and In the mountains
west of the river Alt. It Is admitted
that the Rumanian troops were with

STOCKHOLM. Oct. S. "Sweden
proclaimed her neutrality at the very
outbreak of the war. All her actions
since that time have borne out that
proclamation, nnd all rumors or accu
sations that she has done, or Intends
to do, anything Inconsistent with this
attitude are due either to failure to
comprehend her situation or to some
less creditable reason. And when
ever 8weden has taken any step dis
pleasing one or other belligerent
power her action has been dictated
solely by consideration of the king
dom's own necessities and of Its
future welfare, and not by any parti

th belligerents will not make It Im
possible for us to maintain this
attitude unto the end."

River Karabarum region was cap

the Turks.
Two meetings, each largely at

of the candidates.
Hon. Hugh H. Brown officiated as
chairman of the meeting. In his well
known quiet eloquence, with phrase

plause greeting them. The meeting
was one of careful and appreciative

blatant enthusiasm, This was due
largely to the argumentative lines of
the addresses made, none of the

solely to judgment and reason.

TOKIO, Oct. 5. The resignation of
Premier Okuma brought to a head
the Intense struggle between the
bureaucratic forces and the advocates
of a representative government,
which culminated in the victory of
the bureaucrats by the emperor's des
ignation of Court Terauchl to form a
cabinet.
Premier Okuma aided Baron Kato
In bis efforts to form a new ministry,
and thus succeeded in amalgamating
the three groups composing the gov
ernment's majority In the house of
representatives into one great party.
By this move the new amalgamation
has only the Betyukal, or conserva
tive, party In opposition, and brings
about a two party political situation.
Baron Kato was recommended to
the emperor by Premier Okuma, who
called attention to the fact that Kato
was a leader of the majority groups
In the house of representatives and
had supported loyally the policies of
the present cabinet. Prince Tama
gata, Marquis Matiukata, Prince
Oyama and Marquia Saolnji recom
mended to the emperor the appoint
ment of Count Terauchl. The selec
tlon of Count Terauchl is believed
to be a victory for the army party.
Viscount Ichloro Motono, the ambas
sador to Russia, has been considered
as foreign minister in the cabinet.
It Is learned that Count Terauchl will
ask Baron Kato to support the new
party and thus effect a compromise.
