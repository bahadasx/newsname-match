"SPECIALIST" DID
NOT HAVE THE
Dr. O. B. Hayden Left Minot Promis
ings Never to Practice Again in
North Dakota if Let Go
"Dr." O. B. Hayden, who advertises
himaelf as a specialist from the med­
ical department of the University of
Michigan with 30 years' experience in
the treatment of chronic diseases and
deformities without surgical operation,
appeared at one of the hotels of the
city Wednesday morning, according to
advertisement, but he ran against a
rood-sized snag and soon locked up
nis medicine chest and left the city.
Fact of the matter is, the doctor is
without a state license. State's At­
torney Herigstad interviewed the doc­
tor early that morning and found that
he was practicing under a license is­
sued during the territorial days when
the doctor was living in what is now
South Dakota. The states attorney
conferred with Secretary Williams of
the state medical board and found that
the license was void. The doctor wish­
ed to secure permission to complete
his tour of North Dakota, as he had
visions of bulging pocket books and he
wanted to get back some of the j*ood
money that he spent for. advertising,
but the officials would not listen to
him. He promised that if he were not
prosecuted, he would leave the state
at once.
The doctor admitted that he had not
made much money practicing in South
Dakota and that he found these trips
very profitable. He advertises that he
treats all troubles from worms to con­
sumption, diseases peculiar to the
young, the middle aged and the old.
He was ready to accept money from
all comers. It is well that the officers
stepped in and blocked his little game
for there were numerous patients in
the city looking for the doctor after he
was gone. One farmer from Des Lacs
had blood in his eye. He stated that
he had made a long trip through the
mud on purpose to see the renowned
specialist and he threatened to bring
suit against the doctor because he was
not on hand.
The doctor is located at a little coun­
try town down in South Dakota and
while he may have graduated years
ago from a medical school, he is no
more of a specialist than any other
doctor practicing in North Dakota.
The public may learn in time that it
is much better to stick to the home
physician.
Almy Attends Veteran's Meeting.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Almy have re­
turned from a visit to the Twin Cities
and International Falls, Minn. They
spent a week in the wooded country at
tne last named- place. Mr. Almy, who
is a member of the G. N. Veterans'
Association, attended the annual meet­
ing at St. Paul Sept. 16. The meeting
was held in the new Hill building. One
afternoon the Veterans were taken
out to North Oaks, the Hill farm,
where they visited Mr. Hill's grave.
Here hymns were sung and a prayer
given. Mrs. Hill invited the Veterans
to call at her residence on the farm
and she shook hands with them all.
At the Louis Hill residence, which is
also located on the farm, luncheon was
served. That night a banquet was
served in St. Paul. The next meeting
will be held at Glacier Park.
OFFICERS RAID
MIS POOL Hdll
Sheriff and States Attorney Interrupt
Two Poker Games and Lock Up
Entire Room on Injunction
Sheriff Nedreloe and States Attor­
ney Herigstad made a raid on the Sam
Loomis pool hall, located in a base­
ment on Main street, Friday night and
found two well organized poker games
in progress, one conducted by Loomis
and the other by Ted Young, who has
appeared in the public eye before. The
officers were armed with an injunc
tional order and the entire pool room
was padlocked, front and rear.
A short time ago liquor was found
in a small rom partitioned off from
the main roohi and this was closed by
an injunctional order. The poker

FALL PLANTED ONIONS.
Certain kinds of onions can be
SlantedDakota
in the fall, according to a
forth market gardener, that
will be ready for use early in the
spring It is not generally known
that onions of the perennial variety
may be planted in the autumn, and
will be ready for use almost as soon
as the snow is off the ground in the
spring. In fact, they have been found
to make quite a start under the snow.
The sets of this variety grow at the
end of the seed stalks, and should be
gathered as soon as formed, and kept
in a cool, dry place until September
or October. A rich bed should be
riPP' "fv *5
made and the sets planted and they
will be ready for use before the ordi­
nary onions are grown. While these
onions are perennial and increase by
roots and tip sets, they are more ten­
der when a new bed is put out every
year instead of allowing them to mul­
tiply in their own fashion.
These onions never grow large
bulbs. In fact the bulb is little if any
larger than the stem. But it is white
and tender early in the spring. It is
slightly stronger in flavor than ordi­
nary onions, but if this is disliked,
soaking the onion for an hour or two
in salt water just before using will
dissipate some of the flavor.
No Poison in Jozef Brauen's Stomach
An autopby was held Wednesday
over the remains of Jozef Brauen, the
Austrian found dead in the New York
hotel the day before. Doctors were
unable to find any trace of poison in
the man's stomach, so it is not be­
lieved that he committed suicide. His
companion was located Tuesday even­
ing. He stated that Brauen had been
working for Geo. W. Kemper on the
construction of a sewer main. A week
ago he drank heavily and complained
of stomach trouble. The man claimed
to be an Ausrian and said that he had
several brothers living in the old
country. The remains were buried
Wednesday afternoon.
Chief of Police Dougherty has iden­
tified the man by letters found on the
clothing. It has been learned that he
recently received treatment from Dr.
Owen of Rhinelander, Wis. The chief
received a call from Whitewater, Wis.,
yesterday, but the message could not
be gotten thru. It is presumed that
the message was from some of
Brauen's friends. The doctors who
examined the body are positive that
the wiitfi died of natural causes and no
inquest will be held.
HOW GEAR TEETH
ARE TESTED
Dodge Brothers' Engineers Develop a
Machine to Measure Force
Needed to Break Them
Every part that enters into a high
grade motor car must pass a series of
rigid tests. In the plant of Dodge
Brothers, acknowledged to be one of
the best of the industry, nothing is left
to chance. Every part is not only thor­
oughly tested but so carefully are
tests conducted that it is definitely
known just what each part will stand.
In testing the teeth of gears the or­
dinary test has been to deliver a pow­
erful blow against the teeth. The ef­
fect of the blow was easily apparent
but it was impossible to measure how
much force had been expended. The
problem was put up to the engineers
of Dodge Brothers and they developed
a machine that delivers the blow and
at the samie time measures the force
used.
The principle is the same as though
a workman took a chisel, placed it
against a tooth and struck the chisel
with a hammer. In the case of the
machine a sharp blade is forced
against the tooth with a heavy impact
and on a dial the "left over energy" is
registered. It is a simple matter of
mathematics then to calculate the
amount of force needed to break the
tooth.
TWO BAD MEN WERE
CAUGHT AT KENMARE
Jack Morgan and W. Logan were
arrested by the officers at Kenmare
Monday night and are being held on
charges of burglary, and in addition,
Morgan has the further charge of car­
rying a gun lodged aainst him, and
the officials have sufficient evidence
to convict the men on all the charges.
On September 16, the home of J. L.
B. Thomas of that place was entered
and considerable property was stolen.
The officials suspected the criminals
who were landed last night and played
a "watchful waiting" game. When
they had the trap ready it was sprung
and the men were caught with much
of the stolen property and consider­
able other evidence on them.
Tyrian Chapter Has Red Letter Day.
Tyrian Chapter No. 14, R. A. M.,

Wednesday, six candidates being given
the degrees that afternoon and even­
ing. Three brothers, John W., W. H.
and Geo. M. Robinson of Garrison,

Douglas, R. H. Ray of Garrison and
E. J. Walsh of Minot the other. The
work in the afternoon was in charge
of Acting High Priest, A. D. Hagen
stein and that of the evening was in
charge of F. L. Meservey, the High
Priest. The session was a long one.
the work not being completed until
one o'clock this morning.
At 6 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Geo.
Hoover served a fine chicken supper
and a lunch was served after the en­
tire work had been completed. There
is considerable work ahead for the
Chapter.
Among the visitors were Mr. Tilli-
E[ign
augh of Velva and G. L. Bickford,
Priest of the Bowbells Chapter.
East Minot Lot Sale
The sale of lots in East Minot Fri­
day and Saturday was not extra well
attended and only $800 worth of lots
were sold. Mr. Akers of the South­
west Land Co. hopes to sell a large
part of the tract by private sale. The
sale was novel in that the lots were
sold at auction. The addition has re­
ceived a great deal of advertising.
NEIL DUNCAN
.v,*
A week ago last Sunday, after pack­
ing his trunk, he went to the Great
Northern depot intending to leave for
Grand Forks to begin his second year
of work at the university, but he felt
so ill that he returned home hoping
to feel better in a day or two. The dis­
ease took such a hold on him that his
condition soon became very serious
and his case was regarded, almost
hopeless from thence on.
Neil was one of the finest young men
of the city. He had lived here ever
since he was a little boy and a year
ago graduated from the Minot high
school with honors. He was a general
favorite with teachers and schoolmates
as well. He was a good Christian
young man and regarded very highly
by a great concourse of friends. He
leaves a broken-hearted mother, a
brother and a sister who have the sin
cerest sympathy of all. The
future for this young man appeared
the very brightest and his loved ones
receive consolation only in the thought
that his taking must have been willed
by the All Wise Ruler of our destiny.

MSIENT FOUND
DEAD ON
Joe Brown Died Tuesday in His Room
at New York Hotel—May Have
Taken Dose of Poison
Joe Brown, a transient laborer, who
appears to have been about 45 years
of age, was found dead on his bed at
room 15 of the New York hotel, North
Main street, at three o'clock Tuesday
afternoon.
He had been working about the city
for about ten days, during which time
he stayed at this hotel. On account
of the rain he did not work on Tues­
day and at about ten o'clock he went
to is room. No sound was heard and
a maid investigating found the body
on the bed. He was lying face down­
ward, in a diagonal position across the
bed and was fully dressed. He did not
appear to be a drinking man and ap­
parently was a hard-working man. His
clothing was clean and the general ap­
pearance of his body was good.
State's Attorney Herigstad is inves­
tigating the matter. Doctors will
make an examination to determine
whether or not the man died of pois­
oning. It is possible that this is a
case of suicide. Brown has a partner
working in the city and efforts are be­
ing made to locate him.
The man had a dollar bill in his
pockets and a few personal effects.
The body was taken to Rowan's under­
taking parlors where it is being held.

VETERAN ENGINEER HAS RE­
TIRED—43 YEAR AT THROTTLE
Fred Almy, Engineer for 43 Years, is
Retired on Account of Age Limit—
Receives Pension for Life.
After thirty years continuous en­
gine service with the Great Northern,
Fred Almy, the veteran engineer was
retired on account of the age limit
Sept. 16. Altho Mr. Almy will never
be able to pull the throttle on a rail­
way engine again, he is still consider­
ed an employee of the company and
will receive a pension as long as he
lives. Both Mr. and Mrs. Almy have
life passes over the entire Great Nor­
thern system.
Mr. Almy is 71 years of age and
has seen 43 years of engine service.
From 1874 until 1882 he was employed
on the St. Paul & Pacific railway,
which later became the Great North­
ern. From 1882 until 1887 he was in
the employ of the Canadian Pacific
and from 1887 until Sept. 16 last he
has been connected with the Great
Northern. Most of this time, he has
resided in Minot.
During all of that time, Mr. Almy
was in but one wreck. That was in
1887, when his engine went thru a
bridge. Mr. Almy was seriously in­
jured, suffering a fracture of the leg
and other injuries which laid him up
for eight months, four months of that
time he being in the hospital. He was
seriously burned at that time and car­
ries great scars to this day. His en­
gine dropped eighteen feet with cars
piled on top and his escape from death
was
A
miracle.
For many years Mr. Almy was a
close friend of the late James J. Hill,
who regarded him as one of the most
efficient engineers in the employ of the
Great Northern.
BRYAN CLAIMS NORTH
DAKOTA FOR WILSON
William J. Bryan, after completing
his tour of Montana and North Da­

rival in Minneapolis that both of those
states would go for Wilson. Bryan
said that he had campaigned in North
Dakota four years ago and he was
greeted more enthusiastically on his
recent trip than ever. He believes that
Minnesota's vote will be close.
WORK
IN THE EAST
Secretary of Commercial Club Learns
Many Things at Convention That
Will Help Minot Organization.
The Independent received an inter­
esting letter from Will E. Holbein,
secretary of the commercial club, who
attended the national meeting of com­
mercial club secretaries at Cleveland,
O., last week. Mr. Holbein is attend­
ing to business in the east in the in­
terests of the city and feels that his
visit will prove profitable. Mr. Hol­
bein went thru the Goodrich Rubber
Co.'s plant at Wadsworth, 0.. and got
in touch with the sales manager, also
had lunch with the president and sec
retary-treasurer of the Miller Tire Co.
They are old boyhood friends of Mr.
Holbein, each worth over a million
dollars, but as common as old shoes.
At the convention at Cleveland Mr.
Holbein learned many things that will
help make the Minot commercial club
a real vehicle of good for Minot. Mr.
Holbein will return via Chicago, St.
Paul and Minneapolis and will arrive
in Minot next Wednesday afternoon.
The weather in the east has been hot.
WIDE-AWAKE MOUNTRAIL
COUNTY EDITOR IN THE CITY
J. S. Patterson, publisher of the
Stanley Promoter, Ross News and
Sanish Pilot, was in the city on busi­
ness Wednesday. Mr. Patterson has
purchased a new Model 5 linotype ma­
chine which he will install at his Stan­
ley plant, and furnish type for his
three newspapers. He is kept fairly
busy but finds time to look after his
duties as district game warden.
Carroll Not a Candidate for Judge.
Dorr H. Carroll will not be a candi­
date for district judge of the Eighth
Judicial district. The Nonpartisan
League was considering endorsing
someone for this position and were
considering Mr. Carroll, but after due
thought decided that the organization
to be consistent with its original plans,
would endorse no one for the position.
This leaves the contest between the
present incumbent, K. E. Leighton.
and F. B. Lambert, the regular nomi­
nees at the primaries.
John Skoglund, who owns the south­
west quarter of section 32, recently
bought the Torginson quarter adjoin­
ing his place on the east. John had a
deep well put down on his place this
summer and was fortunate in striking
a fine flow at a depth of 232 feet. By
putting a reducer on the^ pipe the
water spouts upward a distance of
twenty feet, making this one of the
finest flowing wells in the country.
John now has one of the most desir­
able farms in this section of the state.
He obtained about 300 bushels of ex­
cellent seed wheat from one of his
fields this season. His oats went 32
bushels per acre and besides he has a
fine field of potatoes, so we have no
hesitancy in saying that worry has no
place in the Skogland household this
season.
Some extra choice potatoes were
grown this season in the light sandy
soil north of Granville. This soil pro­
duces very heavy crops under certain
conditions and practically every year
it grows the very best of potatoes and
garden vegetables. The farmers who
will grow five or six acres of potatoes
every year will make money on the
average. One year a farmer in that
locality put in 200 acres of potatoes,
raising about 40,000 bushels. This
broke him for many of the potatoes
were frozen before he could market
them and the price was low.
FIRST
SECTION
PLAN GENERAL
HOSPITAL FOR THE
WONDER CITY
Meeting Held Monday Night and Plans
Discussed for New Modern Non
Sectarian Hospital for Minot.
At a meeting of quite a large num­
ber of prominent citizens of Minot at
the Commercial club rooms Monday
evening, plans were laid for Minot's
new General Hospital.
Halvor L. Halvorson was chairman
of the meeting and R. J. Piper sec­
retary.
Plans are under way to build the
first unit of a hospital to cost a quar­
ter of a million dollars when the en­
tire structure is completed. The pre­
liminary plans call for the first unit to
cost in the neighborhood of $75,000,
containing 75 beds.
The chair appointed R. E. Barron,
L. H. Kermott and Peter Fugelso as a
committee to select a temporary
board of eleven directors, which will
have charge of the preliminary work
of securing a charter and arranging
for a constitution and by-laws.
The ministers of the various Minot
churches are to constitute an advisory
board and according to present plans,
stock in the concern is to be sold in
Minot and surrounding country. One
of the pleasing features of the plans
is to allow those who buy stock to use
it to pay hospital bills. This will en­
able many to take out stock as a form
of insurance. The committee hopes
to be able to secure a first class site
this fall and have plans for the first
unit prepared during the coming win­
ter so that work can be started in the
spring.
Chairman Halvorson, who is an en­
thusiast, explained the benefits that
would accrue to the city as a whole
thru th? erection of such a hospital as
has been planned. A good hospital is
a steady business getter and one of
the very best advertisements that a
city can have. Minot loses a great
deal of money every year because we
do not have the proper hospital facil­
ities, he said. He urged that a site
close in be secured. Visitors cannot
afford to pay bus fares and doctors
and surgeons will appreciate a hospi­
tal conveniently located. The hospital
should be non-sectarian, he said, with
all the Minot doctors represented on
the staff.
Julius Fauchald is intensely inter­
ested in the plan and said he was will­
ing to get behind it for all that he was
worth. He referred to the hospitals
of the east, where rooms were fur­
nished by the various fraternal and
church societies and believed that
much of this work would be done in
this way here.
The action Monday night was in­
spired by the fact that the county
commissioners have advertised to sell
St. Joseph's hospital buildings, which
property is owned by the county, Dec.
4. The^ sale of this institution will
leave Ward county without adequate
hospital facilities.
While the hospital association is not
being organized with a view of mak­
ing anything out of the investment, in
case that the proposition does make
money, it will pay a small percentage,
the balance to go into a sinking fund.
In connection with the hospital a
training school for nurses will be con­
nected.
The following is a list of the direct­
ors of the association who will serve
until their successors are elected and
qualified: Julius Fauchald, H. C. H.
Stege, Robert E. Barron, Paul V. Mc­
Coy, Otto Ellison, E. A. Long, Peter
Ehr, E. S. Person, A. A. Robinson,
Erik Ramstad and Halvor L. Halvor-
THOMPSON CALLED
TO dFAT BEYOND
Well Beloved Minot Woman Died at
Home of Sister Following Long
Period of Suffering
Mrs. Christine Thompson, aged 68
years, passed away at the home of her
sister, Mrs. Erick Ramstad, in this city
Friday afternoon after a long illness.
Just a year ago she suffered an injury
resulting in a compound fracture of
the hip and from this she never recov­
ered. Since that time she has been
bedfast and although she was a great
sufferer, she bore her trials with great
fortitude.
The funeral was held from the First
Lutheran church Tuesday afternoon at
2 o'clock, interment being made in the
Lutheran cemetery. The services were
in charge of the pastor, Rev. T. F.
Gullixson.
Mrs. Thompson is survived by seven
sons, who reside in the Canadian
northwest and in Montana. Her hus­
band died some years ago. She came
to this city from Grafton, but home
steaded near Edmore, N. D., in the
early days.
Mrs. Thompson was an exceedingly
lovable old lady and many friends will
miss her.
