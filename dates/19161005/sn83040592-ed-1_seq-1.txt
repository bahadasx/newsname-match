"Let There Be Light" is a
bibical command that applies
equally as well to material things
as to spiritual understanding.
When J. C Page turned on the
other night, several hundred
candle power of new light in the
drug store he recently purchased,
it created real excitement on the
street so brilliantly did it shine
forth. Page believes in letting
his light shine so that people
passing will see that he has
goods to sell and wants business.
Shortly he will further modernize
his store by having the floor low
ered to the walk level and putting
in plate glass front of the latest
design. Baxter is waking up

Foundry Would Locate Here.
Baxter capitalists with a desire
for local investment have an op
portnnity to finance a foundry
and machine shop. .Ail they
would have to do would be to
take $30,000 in stock in a com
pany to be capitalized for $50,000,
donate a site, and take over the
plant of the Swan machinery
company.of Joplin.for the balance
of the stock. The present mana
gers of the Swan machinery com
pany would conduct the business,
moving their plant over here.
This, in substance, is the propos
ition recently presented to the
Baxter Commercial Club by the
Swan machinery company. On
Mod nay a committe of the Com
mercialClub composed of Presi
dent E. C McWilliama, G. E.
Rucker, T. Connor and E. Wright
went to Joplin to look over the
plrnt. A Commercial Clnb meet
ing was to have been held Tues
day night to listen to a report
from the committee but Dong
Morgan's shows captured all the
members and so the matter is still
pending.

How Catarrh
Is Contracted
Mothers are sometimes as
thoughtless as to neglect the
colds which their children coc
sract. The inflammation of the
mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and the child
has chronic catarrh, a disease
that is seldom cured and that
miT orove a life's burden. Many
persons who have this loathsome
disease will remember having
had freauent colds tat the time it
was contracted. A little fore

This is good time for three hun

Seeks Office of Sheriff.
Theodore Hatton of Columbus,
Republican candidate for sheriff
of this county, was in Baxter
Monday renewing acquaintance
ship with old friends and intro
ducing himself to new voters.'
Hattan believes that anything
worth having is worth asking
for, so not only is he endeavoring
to meet personally as many men
and women ra possible before
election, but also advertising
generously in the papers. His
likeness will be found in this
paper on page 4. In the pri
maries Mr. Hatton secured about
as many votes as all his oppon
ents combined. He attributes a
large part of his success to news
paper advertising, which he de
clares is not only a much cleaner
method of campaigning than
passing around cheap cigars and
other bribes of the old sort, but
also more effective, since his
appeal for support goes with the
oaoer into the home where the
whole familv may read and
discuss the subject

READY FOR BIG
CELEBRATION
The Antis and Their Friends
Will Own Baxter for Two
Whole Days.
The A. H. T. A. days in Bait
er Springs have for years been
the most enjoyable holidays of
all the year, the time when all
people living within twenty miles
of the city come to Baxter to
apend two days having a good
time, watching the races, taking
in the numerous amusements and
best of all meeting and visiting
with old time friends. In a large
wav the Anti Days takes the
place of the old Reunion that
flourished here for several years.
This is the week for the big
gathering. It will begin at noon
Friday and continue right
through till midnight Saturday.
Several new features have been
added to this year's program.
Particularly enjoyable will be
the band music, the best heard in
Baxter for many years. The
committee in charge of the en
tertainment has secured at a
large expense, the celebrated
Shriners' Band of Pittsburg.
The players will come Friday
and will be with us clear through
the celebration, giving concerts
on the street Also we will have
with us Doug Morgan's show
band, with a repertoire of mighty
snappy music. Morgan's cele
brated show will also be here to
amuse the people.
Friday night will be carnival
night a rollicking good time for
all. Prizes are offered for the
most comically attired person,
man or- woman. There wilt be
alllinds ot characters, such as
Happy Hooligan; Topsy, the
Katenjammer Kids, Mutt and
Jeff, Charlie Chaplin, Etc, and
at 9 o'clock following the band
concert they will all form a pro
cession and march through the
streets.
Another attraction that will
create more fun than a box of
monkeys will be the Ford race
for which Jaqueth & Gilman
offer a special prise. The cars
must be driven three blocks and
in the middle of each block and
at the street crossings driver
must stop his car and crank up.
Hood will give a special prize
for the best appearing Buick car
in the parade. t
Much attention has been given
to prizes for school children from
the districts in the neighborhood
of Baxter Springs.
The ladies of the Presbyterian
cbiarch will take care of the inner
man at the chicken dinner which
they will serve at the church on
Saturday from' 11:30, for 35c a

r After Speed Fiends.
Marshall Horton is hopping
right after the speed fiends arid
the auto owners- who refuse to
park their "cars tfn the business
street according to rules. - He
declares he has just begun his
arrests if speeding doesn't stop.
And The News commends his
stand. Speeding and reckless
driving must stop. If the justices
were to assess guilty partids a
bit heavier it would help some.
Watch for the All
Steel Motor )Ca.
S. P. Shafer expects ' to go to
Macon, Mo., within the next fw
days and drive back one of the
new All Steel motor' cars for
demonstration purposes. People
who are in the market for a car
had better wait a few days fld
see the All Steel car before they
buy, for it is some car.
