Astronomical Data for
October.
Venus will continue to be the
morning star throughout the en
tire month of October and Jupi
ter will be the evening star, ris
ing almost due east in the early
evening. Jupiter comes into op
position with the sun on the ev
ening of the 23rd, when it cross
es the meridian, shortly, before
midnight, ' At this time it will be
most fayorably situated for ob
servation, as it will be nearest to
the earth, but as it. moves away
from opposition its distance from
the earth increases slowly. It
will be well situated during the
entire month, but only after it
has risen high above the horizon.
Jupiter is the largest of the . pla
nets, its diameter being 11 times
that of the earth and its weight
318. The surface gravity of Ju
nker is two and sixtyfive hund-
reths times-the gravity of the
earth, so that if a man whose
weight here was 150 pounds were
to be transported to Jupitsr, he
would weigh almost 400 pounds.
Volume : tor volume. , however
Jupiter weighs only about one
quarter a much as the arth. Its
day is short, being only a little
less than 10 hours, and the pecul
iar thing about it is that the
length of the day is different at
different parts of the planet, as
the period differs as much as six
minutes in different localities.
This peculiar fact proves conclu
sively that what we see of Jupi
ter is not the solid surface of the
planet itself, but the upper sur
face of a dense layer of clouds.

kings, about which there will be

BANK CLOSING

Depositors' Money Watted to Pay Po
litical Debts, Illegal Appointment
Made and Extravagant hees Col
lacted Department an Asylum For
Democratic Politician Inefficiency
and Maladministration Shown.
Columbus (Srscial). In no uncer
tain terms the search' ight was turned
on the State Ranking Department un
der former Governor Cox by the state
Republican campaign textbook issued
here today. The textbook asserts that
its statements are backed up by
official records. It says:
Not as a campaign declaration, but
as a demonstrated fact, the Depart
ment of Banks and Banking under
Governor Cox stands out conspicu
ously as unparalleled in the history
of Ohio in any branch of the state
government, for inefficiency, arbi
trariness, wastefulness, extravagance
and general mal administration.
While the superintendent of the de
partment, Emery Lattanner, is to be
held directly responsible, there is no
escape from the conclusion that Gov
ernor Cox himself is personally
chargeable with much of the blame.
In the first place, Governor Cox ap
pointed Mr. Lattanner for political
reasons' in the face of well-grounded
protests on the part of reputable citi
zens of the latter's home county who
knew him well most of them being
Democrats with no relation to faction
alism; the Governor was duly warned.
Mr. Cox also had information gath
ered by a federal judge concerning
Mr. Lattanner. Then, it is inconceiv
able that Governor Cox would not
have known what was going on in
the department had he exercised even
ordinary vigilance and prudence and
the official evidence is overwhelming
that the Governor himself took an tc
tive part personally in making the
Department of Banks and Banking an
asylum for Democratic politicians
without reference to their capabilities
for the lucrative appointments givln
them.
Reference is here made particularly
to the liquidating bureau of the bank
ing department. This bureau pos
sessed tremendous power no branch
of the state government had greater.
It could ruin a financial institution
by closing it, and it could waste the
money of the depositors by needless
expense in liquidating it. The sworn
evidence is that under, Superintendent
Lattanner-a number of banks, were
summarily closed unnecessarily, it
afterwards being demonstrated that
their assets were ample to cover their
liabilities had proper "horse sense"
been shown by the department; and
it is incontrovertible that there were
gross extravagance and recklessness
in the liquidation proceedings. That
the liquidating bureau' was made a
political clearing house in which to
reward partisan and personal friends
of Governor Cox is thoroughly estab
lished. As politics generally go this
in itself would not be deemed a hein
ous offense were the recipients of the
appointments capable and did they
earn their salaries; but the proof is
that the opposite was the rule. That
the money of the depositors in the
closed and liquidated banks was used
to reward Democratic politicians is
evident from the fact that of the
eighteen deputies or liquidating
agents employed, seventeen were
Democrats; and of the thirty-five at
torneys employed twenty-nine were
Democrats.
The facts and figures presented be
low are taken from official documents,
the principal being: The report of
the select committee of the Eighty
first General Assembly (1915), printed
with all the evidence verbatim in vol
ume 106 of the Ohio Senate Journal;
reports by Special Examiners Bliss
and Tatman cm file in the office of
the Auditor of State, details of which
have not heretofore seen much of the
sunlight of publicity; annual reports
of the department; and reports of
special inquiries by official examiners
supplementary to the other reports.
. Extravagance-and Inefficiency
False Reports.
The total amount expended in the
department during the year ending
November lb, 1H14, was $84,193.22;
but Superintendent Lattanner report
ed only $78,338.81 a difference of
$5,854.41. The legislative investigat
ing committee declared that this in
correct report was "evidently intended
to deceive the governor, with whom it
was filed, and all persons who might
read it." That this condemnatory
finding of the committee was justified
is shown by the testimony of John A.
Bliss, the official expert in charge of
the, examination of state departments
and institutions, commissions, etc.,
who, in December, 1914, began an in-
t vestigation of the banking depart
, ment under orders from the Auditor
of State (a Democrat). Mr. Bliss tes
tified that Mr. Lattanner's report cov
ered only 11 months so far as expend!
tures were concerned, while under the
law the practice of the department
he should have covered the entire 12
months of the year. As a matter of
fact, the report itself purported to '
cover the entire 12 months but by
the omission of one month the report
indicated that the management had
been an economical one while in fact
the reverse was true, and, as Exam
iner Bliss testifies, the expenditures
were getting "heavier all of the time."
Examiner Bliss testified that during
one month's administration of Super
intendent Walters, the immediate suc
cessor of Mr. Lattanner, there were
dismissed unnecessary clerks and
liquidating agents whose salaries
alone aggregated $2,800 a month. Ac
cording to Examiner Bliss what was
especially needed in Mi1. Lattanner'a
administration of the banking depart
ment was "more efficiency." Quoting
Examiner Bliss: "The employees (in
the headquarters at Columbus) were
89 thick ia .there that they seemed
to be in Jffi3 another's way, and the
records I found were not written up
to date. The books were not posted
up and everything seemed; to be in
disorder on the desks; ask for some
thing why they would have to hunt
a long time before they could find it.
There, didn't seem to be any system in
the office." Mr. Lattanner left many
bills unpaid, according to th report
of the legislative investigating com
mittee; and Examiner. Bliss declared
that at the end of Superintendent Lat
tanner's administration the j depart
ment was actually bankrupt. j( Reflect
a moment: The man who so adminis
tered his office, with all the state's re
sources at his back, vras closing up
banks, and administering" thg liquida
tion proceedings of financial institu
tions!) Although the amount avail
able for the department in 1914 (un
der Lattanner) was $85,193.22 as com
pared with $58,130.34 in 1913, Mr.
Lattanner had to appeal to the Gen
eral Assembly for an extra appropri
ation in order to conduct his depart
ment. ;
A Contrast Then, and Now.
Against this extravagance and in
efficiency of Mr. Lattanner's admin
istration, under Governor Cox's re
gime, there is the showing made by
the present Superintendent of Banks,
Harry T. Hall, under Governor Willis.
In Mr. Hall's report covering the
period from November 16, 1914, to
June 30, 1915, it was stated that the
number of employes had been reduced
from 38 to 26, and that the payroll
had been reduced $1,000 a month;
and out of the short appropriation,
covering the period from February 15
to June 30, 1915, there" was saved
$1,230.75, which money reverted to the
state. Yet, with decreased payrolls
and expenses, the i 'department en
larged its service 'to the common
wealth, it having sunVrased 553 state
banks, as against 530 existing at the
close of the last fiscal year.
LEGISLATORS GIVEN JOBS.
Lucrative and unnecessary jobs
were given to Democratic politician
in the liquidating bureau to pay off
the political debts of Governor Cox
this is a matter of record.
An astounding phase of this sys
tem of using the money ,of the de
positors in banks in financial difficul
ties is the fact that a number of
Democratic members of the legislature
were given fat jobs in this bureau
FARMING OUT OF BANKS
HAS CEASED IN OHIO.
The most vicious of all po
litical traditions is that of
treating a bank in distress as
just an opportunity to reward
a political worker by closing its
door and making him its liqui
dator. This tradition makes it
a constant temptation for an
administration to intervene to
wreck a bank rather than to
save it. According to the Wi
nans' legislative report, the
last Democratic administration
yielded to the temptation. Its
closing year was an orgy of
political liquidation in the
banking department in which
forty Democratic attorneys
joined, at a cost to depositors
eight times as great as that in
curred in the first year of the
Willis administration in the
legitimate work of liquidation.
The service which the present
banking regime has performed
is not merely in ending this
oppression of depositors but
also in eliminating a semi
piratical custom a practice as
ruthless as that of the wreck
ers of the Cornish coast. The
farming out of failed banks,
like the farming out of taxes,
has ceased at least in Ohio
Governor Frank B. Willis.
in open defiance of all good taste and
custom, and in at least two of these
instances Governor Cox advised and
approved the appointments.
One of these members of the Gen
eral Assembly thus improperly em
ployed was Representative M. A.
Warnes, of Holmes County, the author
of the infamous Warnes tax law and
the leader of the Democratic majority
in Governor Cox's legislature. In an
especial sense Representative Warnes
was the personal spokesman of Gov
ernor Cox in the House; it was to
him direct that Governor Cox sent his
messengers with executive order as
to legislative matters; and . it was
next to Representative Warnes in the
hall of the House that a clerk from
the Governor's office sat (contrary to
the rules) to personally direct, as
the representative, of , the Governor,
the carrying out of those orders. Sup-

This bill for an overcoat was paid out of the funds of the wrecked Met

Out of the same bank funds there was paid the cost of framing large

office of the State Superintendent of Banks at Columbus. This money has
been collected back by the present superintendent of banks and turned over
to its owners, the depositors.

sentative Warnes drew $100 a month
from the state at the same time as
official "spotter" for unlicensed auto
mobiles, although the records fail to
show that he ever reported a single
violation of the law. While drawing
these three salaries from the state
at the same time the author of the
Warnes law was active in the anti
referendum movement under the di
rection- Cf-W. L.vFinley, Chairman ofi
the Democratic State Committee.
Another Democratic legislator who
illegally held office as special attor
ney or liquidating agent for the bank
ing department was Representative
Black, of Hamilton county. Superin
tendent Lattanner says that he also
made this appointment after confer
ence with Governor Cox, who after
wards approved the appointment. In
fact, Governor Cox, took a special in
terest in the case of Representative
Black, according to Superintendent
Laitunncr; the- probable reason was
that Representative Black drew the
initiated bill providing for a "small"
legislature. Representative Black re
ceived $4,2?",. 8D as special attorney
for the banking department and as
liquidating agent for banks closed by
the department.
A third member of the legislature
who was appointed liquidating agent
was Senator Carl Friebolin, of Cuya
hoga county. His salary as agent
was $4,000 a year, while at the same
time drawing his salary as a member
of the legislature. For acting as
liquidating agent of a bank at Am
herst, Senator Friebolin received
$1,959.46; and at the same time his
law partner acted as special attorney
for Superintendent Lattanner in the
same liquidation proceedings, for
which he received $1,467.43.
After the public press had exposed
these improper appointments and ex
travagant fees, the three legislators
above named ceased their connection
with the banking department. Attor
ney General Hogan (a Democrat)
severely criticised their appointment,
and the leading Democratic paper of
northern Ohio, ' - Cleveland Plain
Dealer, thus expressed itself:
"No member of the present legisla
ture should have accepted employ
ment of that kind, and the administra
tion (Governor Cox) should not have
countenanced it.!'
But the administration d ' counte
nance it. However, at the subsequent
session of the General Assembly a
law was passed making the penalty
for violation more severe, not only as
regards such cases as tht above, but
also as to a number of other instances
of . members cf the Cox legislature
who held state jobs.
DEPOSITORS' MONEY WASTED
TO PAV POLITICAL DEBTS.
One cf the most notable instances
of how the money of depositors was
used to pay off the political debts of
Governor Cox was that of the Secre
tary of the Democratic State Central
Committee, who received the sum of
$6,473.37 as attorney for the Superin
tendent of Banks in liquidation pro
ceedings. The legislative investigating com
mittee reported:
"Since May 16, 1911, there were 18
banks liquidated, in whole or in part,
at a total cost of $96,191.73, up to
December 31st, 1914. Of this amount
the sum of $50,749.11 was paid to fav
ored attorneys, a majority of whom
were appointed by the superintend
ent (Mr. Lattanner), not because of
their qualifications, but in payment of
political debts, some either upon the
direct - suggestion of James M. Cox,
then Governor of Ohio, or by the sup
erintendent himself."
There is expert evidence, and also
UNDER COX,
A CLOSED BANK WENT
the testimony of official examiners
borne out by subsequent develop
ments that a number of the banks
closed by order of the superintendent
and liquidated under his supervision
at extravagant and needless cost,
were actually solvent, and that these
banks might have been saved. The
culpability of Mr. Lattanner in his
extravagance and especially in neea
lessly closing up banks, aroused in
tense indignation in the local com
munities, and protests were made to
Governor Cox, but without avail. It
should be borne in mind that it wen
not the state, but the depositors which
paid the expenses of liquidation, and
m a number of cases this was a great
hardship and injustice on the deposit
ors. COX'S HORSE REPORTER AS A
LIQUIDATING AGENT.
One of the liquidating agents em
ployed by direct orders of Governor
Cox was George W. Knecht, of Day
ton, who went to Oborn to take
charge of the 0?born bank in June
1913. State Bank Examiner John D.
Bainer told the legislative investigat
ing committee that he was present at
the O:;born bank when Mr. Knecht
came there and introduced himself to
Superintendent Lattanner. Mr. Bainer
testified:
"As near as I can remember it, it
seems to me that Knecht was c
stranger to Lattanner. and he intro
duced himself and he said to him
'I am the man that Governor Cox
spoke to you about,' or words to that
effect 'that Governor Cox sent ove
here.' . . . Knecht said he wrote
horse news for Cox's farm paper.
ILLEGAL EXPENDITURES.
Under date of May 20, 1916, there
was filed with the Auditor of State a
voluminous report, signed by John A,
Bliss, special examiner, of the exami
nation of accounts pertaining to the
liquidation of banks, this examination
having been made by L. G. Tatman
and Arnold Kallmcrten, state examin
ers. Nineteen banks are covered by
the report. Following is the verbatim

MANIPULATION OF RECORDS."
Under the above caption Examin
ers Tatman and Kailmertcn make
some grave charges against Superin
tendent Lattanner. They say that he
"seems to have diverted the sum of
$300" of the funds of the Security
Bank of Columbus, which he closed
and liquidated. Under the same head
ing it is recorded that Mr. Lattanner
set aside the sum of $5,565.84 as "un
claimed deposits;" but an examination
of the books of the Citizens' Savings
Trust Pank (which he had made the
depo?:tory in the liquidat'ng proceed
ings) "shows that he actually depos
ited in his name as unclaimed deposits
the sum of $4,205.84, or the sum of
1.300 less than the journal shows to
have been deposited." Quoting the
report:
i ,w books of the Citizens' Savings
and Trust Bank, on the same day, also
show that Mr. Lattanner, among other
checks, drew $4,263.84 (which was de
posited in another account), $600,
$700, and $100, all of whk-h checks are
missing from the files so far as we
have been able to determine. How.
ever, the check for $100 purports to
be to Georgia Goddard for extra ser
vices in posting books. The records
do not show any entry made for the
$600 and $700."
In the original report by Examiner
Tatman there are a number of still
graver charges against' Superintend
ent Lattanner, expressed in very plain
language.
AN ARBITRARY BANK "BUSTER."
The sworn testimony given before
the legislative committee shows that
Superintendent Lattanner was rankly
arbitrary in closing hanks, and that in
a number of cases there was no neces
sity at all for his shutting the doors
and putting the institutions in liqui
dation. One hank in particular was mad
the victim of this outrageous treat
ment the Security Savings Bank of
Columbus. The order to close thai
bank came peremptorily without a
moment's time being given to meet
the demands of the banking depart
ment; and, in so acting, Superintend
ent Lattanner broke faith with the
examiner of the Columbus Clearing
House Asociation. That gentleman,
with a number of the leading bankers
of Columbus, testified that there was
absolutely r.o necessity for the order
to close the bank that it was at that .
time in better condition than it had
been for years; that the depositors ?
were amply protected; and that cer
tain paper classed as worthless or
doubtful by the Superintendent of
Banking was perfectly good. The
Clearing House Association offered to
"see the bank through," but Mr. Lat
tanner was determined to close it.
Then the Association pleaded to be al
lowed to liquidate the bank, as had
been done in other cases, in order to
save expense; but Mr. Lattanner re
fused the offer, and insisted on nam
ing both the attorney and the liquidat
ing cgent. So finally the Clearing
House Association gave him the mon
ey and allowed him to liquidate the
bank in his own way. Evidence was
given that had Mr. Lattanner allowed
the Association to manage affairs, thb
Security Bank "would still be running
and in good shape."
BLUE SKY-LARKING
A sort of a side-issue of the bank
ing department is what is known as
the "P.lue Sky" department. Its pur
pose is to investigate the standing and
business reputation of those who want
to deal in securities and real estate
not located in Ohio. The Superintend
ent of Banks is the Commissioner of
the Blue Sky department The leg
islative committee unearthed the pe
culiar methods relating to the so
called investigations of proposition
for the sale in Ohio of outside secur
ities and real estate, in which prom
inent Democratic politicians figured
The first relates to the Lake Hfgh
land Co., of Florida. Simply becaus
"he wanted to make the .trip," al
though he was not connected with th
department, W. L. Finley, Chairmai
of the Democratic State Committee
was entrusted with the duty of "in
vestigating", the company named, it
having filed an application to do busi
ness in Ohio. In the early part of the
winter of 1914 Mr. Finley went on this
mission. The company paid all his ex
penses. On his return he did not make
any written report, but simply on his
verbal assurance that everything was
all right a certificate was granted to
the company entitling it to do business
in Ohio.
The second case was that of the Du
fur Orchard Co., of Oregon. Secretary
of State Graves (of course a Demo
crat) asked to be assigned to make
the so-called investigation, and he
went to Oregon in August, 1914. He
