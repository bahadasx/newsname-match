time to an appreciative gathering last
Saturday.
Mr. S. W. Etheridge, the leading
merchant and postmaster at Apopka,
passed through Belleview the other
morning bound for Ocala, Gainesville
and some other places. He stopped in
at Tremere's long enough to shake
hands, exchange a few compliments,
light a cigar and then he was gone. .
The REAL, new, long tpring, easy
riding, soft and deeper upholstered
MAXWELL touring cars, SIXTY
INCH TREAD, have arrived in Ocala,
and will be on display the last of the
week. tf
