While Hickman already has tw
big wholesale grocery concerns,

STOCK BARN BURNS.
Henry McClannahan, of Crutch
field, lost a big barn by fire
Sunday night. When discovered
the fire had made such progress
that nothing could be saved.
The barn was stored with baled
and loose hay, machinery of all
kinds. At the time of the fire
two mules, a horse au a cow
were in the barn and could not
be saved. Insurance amounting
to -fsoo will partly cover the loss.
Subscriptions to the Courier are
rolling in at a rapid rate now
a days. People we never saw be
' fore are coming in and planking
down a dollar with orders to
"send it a year and don't let
me miss a copy."

COTTON HIGHEST EVER.
CREED NETS 72c IN SEED.
John Creed, loctd planter and
business man, sold a bale of cot
ton Monday that netted him T',-e
in the seed. It was, of course, a
nice staple.
Many loads of cotton sold Sat
urday up to $'. a hundred in
the seed, but Mr. Creed's cotton,
by reason of having it ginned,
turned out an equivalent of 7Vi:
in the seed.
It might also be said that the
highest prices ever paid here for
cotton was paid jesterday when
the market went to 71 je in the
seed. The previous high
water mark was made last year
when the market touched ."fti.20.
There is even talk now of N:
seed cotton, which would be
some price, 1 thank you.''
At the present prevailing
prices, cotton raisers are enjoy
ing real prosperity; share-croj-l
era are paying out and squar
ing up many old accounts made
baekin 1914, when cotton was
going at lVu" a PuUI,d.
The fire whistle hasn't blown
in a long time but look out
when cohl weather starts. Fires
will follow and it may be your
property. Uetter have it in

pay losses promptly.

EXCERPTS OF WILSON'S
SHADOW LAWN ADDRESS.
Time out of number America
has devi-ted itself to peiieoi'id
pursuits, jind business is ihe ex
pression. There never v;ts a time when
the pulse of energy anl success
beat so hiirii in the blood of ' A
nier ica.
It would bo intolerable for the
commerce of the country to be
held up.
I do not regard the principle of
the eight-hour day us arbitrable.
Labor is not a commodity but
a cooperation.
The chief cloud on the American
horizon is the relation between
capital and labor. So long as
the.se are antagonistic there will
be danger.
Court decisions show that an in
vestigation is the only way to
decide whether the railroads can
be-
be-do
afford an eight-hour day. 1
lieve in the eight-hour day
cause under iothe men can
better work.
A way must be found for pre
venting a repetition of a situation
ike the threatened railroad
strike.
America is never going to say
t individuals "you must work,"
but it is goinr to tell organiza
tions of men that they shall not
interrupt the life of the nation.
TWO BURIED SAME DAY
FROM SAME TOWN.
An incident of unusual occur
rence was that of two corpses,
both from the same town, being
brought here on the same l;iy for
interment. One of these was the
two J ear old daughter of Mrs.
Annie Bradley and tlie other a
small child of Herman Choate,
both of Hickman. The little
bodies were brought here Mon
day. The child of Mrs. l'radley
was buried in the Bradley grave
yard n rth of town, while the
child of Mr. and Mrs. Choate was
laid to rest in the city cemetery.
Jloti were girls and only a few
months difference in their ages.

TO TAKE VOTE ON BOND
ISSUE FOR STREET WORK.
At the Monday night meeting
of tlie city council, it was decid
ed to submit to the voters of
Hickman the proposition of vot
ing $20,000 bonds for the pur
pose of street improvement.' It
will be submitted at the regular
November election. It has been
calculated that the money we
spend patching streets will be
sufficient to pay off the bond is
sue and this has proven to be
tlie case at Clinton, Fulton and
other cities. that have built streets
by issuing bonds.
As a matter of fact, this issue
could not be sold legally unless
the water and light bond account,
now pending in the court of ap
peals, should be decided in favor
of the city. Put there will be no
harm done in voting on the is
sue during' the interin. If the city
wins in the case, then the bonds
can be sold and the work done.
