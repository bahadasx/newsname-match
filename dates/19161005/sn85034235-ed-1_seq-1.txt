CHAPTER XIX.
In a Prison Celi.
P:S. LAXGHAM led her daughter
straight to her room, and when
they were inside she closeJ the
door and sank into a chair,
; from her rapid walk.
•\Yhat is it, mother?" Cora demand
"Vou ought to understand, heaven
knows!" Mrs. Langbam cried. "Haven't
you heard about Howard Tinsley?"
"Yes, but what"—
-Weil, you have ordinary sense, I'm
sure," Mrs. Langbam timed out. "This
whole town and a few even down at
home lia vc been connecting your name
with that boy's "for the last two
months. I said nothing because you've
had hartnless affairs with all sorts of
young men everywhere we've ever
spent the summer. But this is differ
ent. You've entertained him at our
house. The Atlanta papers, because
he was a sort of editor, made mention
of his visit to us. We are tied up in
this terrible affair, I tell you. Your
father will be furious enough to dis
own you, and folks in the hotel here
:;re actually asking me if you and that
young jailbird are not engaged."
Stunne 1 beyond utterance over what
had happened prior to this tirade. Cora
sank into a chair near a window. She
could think of only one thing now,
and that was the calamity which had
befallen lier friend.
"Why don't you talk? Say some
thing, for God's sake!" Mrs. Langbam
groaned. "What are we going to do?"
"l>o? Why. mother, what can wo

"We can do something, and wc must
do something, and without delay," the
older woman broke in. "We can pack
as quickly as possible and get away
from tliis silly town. The papers Will
announce our return to Atlanta, and
the public will at least know that wo
are not here backing the man up. no
matter what the gossips may try to
make ont of liis past attentions to you.
If we stay here they will sav you are
heartbroken. And who do you think
would care to marry a girl under a
cloud like that?"
"So you would have me turn against
him the moment lie is In trouble," Cora
answered. "Howard wid know why
wc left town, and that will add to his
humiliation. He may be innocent, moth
er. They say he denies it outright."
"Of course lie would deny it! What
fool wouldn't under the circumstances?
Don't argue with me, Cora. I'm your
mother, and right now I have a clearer
head than you have. You will live to
see the day you will be glad I forced
you to be sensible. We've got to get
: away today on the first train.'
"Do you mean to say that you actual
I ly want to stay?" Mrs. Langbam ex
claimed. rising and striding heavily to
iter daughter's chair and standing over
her.
"I don't know what I want," Cora
muttered despondently. "I don't—don't
know how I feel toward him. I don't
know nty own heart. I don't know
that I have a heart like most girls, but
I know I am sorry for Howard and do
not want to accuse him by running
away like this. His other friends"—
Cora was thinking in dismay of Mary
Tniiublcy—'"will not turn against him."
"What if they don't?" burst from the
desperate matron's lips. "What have

ties to his cell every day. You've got
to bo sensible."
Out or breath Mrs. L&ngC.on paused.
Cora sat mute, paie a tab almost quiver
ing for several minutes. Then she
arose. She drew her-elf up to ber fid.
height, and. going to 'nor bureau, she
looked at Iter face in the mirror. Tak
ing iq* a powder puff, she applied sonn
pink powder to her checks and gen
t ly touched it with lier handker.-hici.
Cora faced lier mother calmly. "Yes
I've got to decide—I've got to he sensi
hie and have it over with." she said
deliberately. "He and. 1 are not en
gaged. He has never even said in sc.
many words that he loved me. it was
just :1 game, mother: but it was the
most interesting me 1 Was ever in. I
know his worth, and if ho were to
toll mo bo is innocent I'd believe him
! have boon spoiled all my life, but
T long for something more genuine
deeper than I have ever had. Every
other man that is attracted to me has
I o.n attracted by my position and
money, but it was not so with Howard.
All aJung 1 have sein that he despised
what i have. All along I have seen
t if i n.uid have thrown it away
and be; onio. of my o»\n volition, as
poor as ho is for his sake, lie would
hate loved me. But 1 am not unself
ish enough. There is a streak of the
practical—the habit of -grasping the
sale side—in me which cainc from you
or father, or both, that holds me in
check.
"You needn't be afraid that I will act
foolishly," she went on. A loathe my
self for it. but when 1 heard of the
murder au. I the likelihood oi Howard's
arrest my first thought was of myself.
1 shall look out lor our interests as
carefully as you would.'*
"You've got a lot more sense than I
f.ave you credit for haying,'' Mrs.
Langbam Lreathed. in relief.
"I have less heart, that's all," Cora
said bitterly. "1 begin to think that
the possession of material advantages
in life means doing without something
finer and more lasting. I got that from
Howard. He reads, and' I don't. I'll
either not marry at all or I'll marry
without deep love or even admiration.
Mother, Mary Trumbleÿ-— the girl you
admired—loves Howard unselfishly.
She would go to Jail with him today if
she hud a chance, it may he that he
will establish his innocence. It may
be that she will help him do it, and
then'
-They will marry aml f be happy ever
afterward.'' Mrs. Langbam made the
jest in sheer elation over her daugh
ter's precaution.
"Yes," Cora replied, "ami prove by a
life of genuine happiness ap'd whole
some simplicity that the thing you and
I strive for and hold so tightly is
worthless—absolutely wert bless. But
that is neither here no*>there," Cora
sighed. "All of tls wft5s are bom to
the possession of means enough to in
sure us a life of empty idleness simply
go without a higher life. 1 heard a
sermon once about Christ and the rich
young man. I now sec that the young
man was simply bound hand and foot
by the belief that he could not do
without the very things I am clinging
to. Christ was doing without wealth,
i
to
and he knew the spiritual freedom of
it. You and I and father and all our
set in Atlanta are slaves. A person
striving to acquire money would laugh
at this statement, but one striving for
spiritual possessions would know what
I mean. I am swaying between two
desires. I'm tired and sick—young as
I am. I'm tired and sick of the life we
live. The lives of these mountain peo
ple contrasted to my own make my
heart ache from sheer emptiness. Some
things tells me that if I had been bom
to
lieie of poor parents Howard Tlnsle.V
and I would be fighting the obstacles
of

lx>
of life side by side"
"For heaven's sake, what is the mat
te:- with you?" Mrs. Langbam inter
rupted. "You are not like yourself.'
"I really don't want to be like my
old reif." Cora answered, her pretty
lips twitching. "But you need not be
afraid. I shall do as yon wish. I shall
do it be ar.se there is nothing else for
a woman in my position to do-bc
cause, in a sense, it is my duty.
"Then we'll pack up at once." Mrs.
Langbam said, with a deep breath.
•'No. Listen, mother." Cora turned
square around. "I am able to see both
sides of the matter. If I were to give
up my part in the play that the youn;
people arc getting up and run off to
day there really would be room for
talk. If we stay on here and act as if
we have no vital connection with tlio—
the awful affair, no one will dare to
to connect my name with it either here
or down at home."
"You may be rhf.it." the older wom
an agreed. "Now that 1 think of it.
your father would wonder why wc
changed our plans, for I wrote him
only the other day that wed stay an
other month."
"Yes. we'll stay." Cora said (irmly
"Now. I'm going back to the hall.
They wiil need me to go over my part
with the rest. Mother, you cau trust
me. I shan't make a fool of myself."
Mrs. Tinsley soon visited Howard in

to cheer him up," she said.
"I'm glad you went, too." Abner re
plied. "You don't believe lie's guilty

"There was one thing 1 wanted to
speak to him about, but somehow 1
couldn't get to it." Mary sighed. "So

You may look on it as very egotistical,
but 1 have enough confidence in my

Abner, Howard has talked to me a
great deal about ids editorial policy,
and I think I know as much about his
general plan as any one except your
seif."
"Yes. I know lie confided in you a
lot,'' Abner said gently. "In fnct. he
told me several times that you had glv
cn him some o' his best ideas!"
At this Mary's color rose higher.
"Uncle Abner," she said, "bail lias
been refused him, hasn't it?"
"Yes." Abner nodded reluctantly.
Mary now looked iter old friend
straight in the face. "Uncle Abner.
I believe I can do work on the paper

don't know why 1 feel so confident,
but I know I can. and. feeling that
way. I thought"—

"Good gracious! Fine, fine!" Abner
clapped his hands. "You are Ute liest
person in the state fer the job."
"Well. I'll come in with you in the
morning," Mary replied happily.
One evening after supper, at the end
of that week, Pole Baker left his wife
and children seated on the strass in
front of Ids cottage and went down tlie
road toward Trumbiey's. He was bent
on seeing Abner Daniel, and thought
tlie present was as favorable a time as
any. However, just as he came into
view of Trumbiey's house in the dusk
lie saw Abner come out at the front
gate and start across an old cornfield
toward the mountain beyond it. Pole
impulsively puckered his; lips to whis
tle, but suddenly changed his mind.
"Maybe I'd better let the old duck
alone," lie mused. "Fer all I know he
mav be out on some private business."
Toie stopped and watched Aimer
climb over the zigzag rail fence which
separated Trumbiey's land from the
mountain forest, and then another idea
came to liitn.

dryly, "an' lie couldn't hag many with

devilment o' any sort."
On the two went. Aimer still lead

pioneer tracing a red-kin over virgin
soil. They were now high above the
farreacliing valley. To the east lay
the straggling ledits of the town. At
iite mountain's foot through an open
door, shone the tire in the kitchen at
Trumbiey's. Suddenly Pole heard
closer to him than be expected a sound
like that of small sticks being broken,
and he paused and stood stiil in won
der. What cou'd it mean? Stick after
stick was cracked asunder, as if Aimer
was bending them across his knee,
some of them giving out shall» report-- !

moment later a light timed up.

his breath in dismay. He saw Abner
draw himself up erect and stand star
ing fixedly in his direction. For a mo
ment the two pairs of eyes glared to
ward each other. Then Abner broke
the silence.
"Who goes thar?" he called out, as
a sentinel might who was doing duty
with a sleeping army in his care.
"A friend—Pole Baker! I didn't
mean to be nosin' about in yore private
business. Uncle Ab. but I went to see

You was right ahead o' me. 1 fullered,

Abner was actually blushing now.
and his friend could not remember ever

To hide his confusion Abner went back
into the shadows and brougb* forward

"I may as well own up an' be done
with it." he finally said, letting his
sheepish glance fall into Pole's reso
