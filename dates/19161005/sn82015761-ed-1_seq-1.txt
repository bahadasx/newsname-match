WILLIAMS, COCONINO COUNTY, ARIZONA. THURSDAY, OCT. 5, 1916.
Number 45
. TO BEJHERE OCT. 6
State Chairman McGonigle of the
Arizona democratic party has no
tified W. M. Hughes of Williams
that several democratic state can-
didates will be in Williams, Fri
day, Oct. 6 for the purpose of ad
dressing Williams voters and to
secure a suitable hall lor them.
This will probably be the only
chance Williams voters will have
to listen to the state candidates of
the democratic party. The oppor
tunity should not be missed. They
are all earnest men of ability and
they represent a good cause. They
are entitled to a respectful hearing
and a good house. They will all
honor our noble president and our
sturdy governor, both real demo
crats who carry out the principles
of democracy in their respective
administrations. Speakers have
been in Williams who have filled
the air with abuse of these pro
gressive executives. Let us hear
from their friends.

Williams Republican .Club last
Monday night was addressed by

A FEW WORDS ABOUT
AN EFFICIENT SHERIFF
Look over the official record of
W. G. Dickinson, sheriff of Coco
nino county, and say if you can
beat' it.! "Only two years in office
and he has established a record for
efficiency which his successors will
strive to emulate but can hardly
hope to surpass. The famous Az-
bill case is enough to prove sheriff
Dickinson a detective of marked
ability. Few men could have con
nected up the incidents of that
crime arid forged a chain of evi
dence which could not be broken
E minent attorneys strove to break
it but it held.
W. G. Dickinson seeks a second
term in the sheriff's office. Voters
are accustomed to extend the cour
tesy of a second term to officials
who have done well in office. They
will hardly make an exception in
sheriff Dickinson's case.

CHILD WELFARE
A Strong Address By F. E.
McFadden
The News is pleased to pre
sent its readers with extracts
from a strong address read be
fore the Educational Depart
ment of the Woman's Club of
Williams Tuesday p. m. Sept.
26. The News recrrets that the
address can not be presented in
full, but lack of space this week
forbids.
Prof. McFadden said:
"We hear mucn about the im
portance of various crops but I
want to call your attention to
one super important crop, the
boy and girl crop. It constitutes
the hope of advancing civiliza
tion because only thru our boys
and girls can continuity of social
purposes be achieved.
This generation of adults is
responsible -for the progress of
the next generation, for the up
ward or downward tendency of
the next generation will depend
on how. this generation fits the
next one to solve its unsolved
problems and to complete its un
finished tasks. Childhood is the
time of preparation for future
social service.
Biologically, the child is the
oldest member of society. Each
one of is a living testimonial to
the development of man from
the single celled protozoa thru I
all intermediary stages, piscian,
amphibian, anthropoid, to his
present ithnoid stage of biolog
ical attainment. The young
child represents a stage in bio
logical development ages remote.
The child comes to us the most
helpless of all young animals.
But in his helplessnnss lies his
possibility of future development.
Bec ause the young child is the
most helpless of all animals
young, he is the richest in possi
bilities of development. At
birth his nervous system is large
ly unorganized, he is educable,
he is capable of learning new
modes of response to surround
ings. Environmental influences affect
both body and mind and -thus
determine physique and mental
ity. Because the child is plastic
of body and mind and because
he is so imitative, environment
is fundamental. A community
in which disease was epidemic
would not constitute a suitable
environment for the rearing of
children. So long as a single
child in the community is infect
ed with a contagious disease, our
own children are not safe. A
prominent American citizen
once said that, "Our country
will not be a good place for any
of us to live in until it becomes
a reasonably good place for all
of us to live in. We cannot
build a barrier of exclusiveness
about ourselves and exclude
disease germs. , We are each our
brother's keeper in matters of
child welfare as well as commun
ity hygiene. . . tr;,.. . , V
v Any, child will be handicapped
for the fullest and highest de
velopment so long as : any other
child with whom he may come
in contact has not been properly
reared. - Hence we must , cooperate-in
every way to eradicate
poverty, ignorance, immorality,
crime in hort all antisocial
practices in order to perfect the
environment for all children.
The organization of a Parent
Teachers Association would give
all an opportunity to meet and
discuss such vital subjects as,
Health Care of Children.
Moral Education of Children.
'S CLUB YEAR
OPENSfAVORABLY
The first General Club Meeting
of the year was held at the home
of Mrs. Robinson Tuesday after
noon. This meeting was a com
bined business and social meeting.
The rooms were gracefully draped
with Virginia creeper which show
ed the effects of the cold snap in
its brilliant colorings. There were
in the neighborhood of forty
members and guests present, the
club beginning the year with a
membership of forty-two.
After the business meeting, each
department was represented by its
chairman or a substitute in a short
paper or talk concerning its work
of last year and that planned for
the coming year.
Mrs. Perrin, chairman of the
literary department presented an
interesting paper on "Drama of
Today" Mrs. Sine mentioned
with satisfaction the objects
accomplished last year, in the
way of cleaning the alleys and
neglected premises also the estab
lishment of a camping ground for
tourists near the town, and com
mented on the suggestion of sign
ing the streets, remarking that its
cost would be prohibitive for the
Woman's Club. The Educational
department was represented by
Mrs. Beck, the Home Economics
department by Mrs. E. A. Miller
and Mrs. Degering spoke of the in
teresting art pictures to be shown
on the screen at the Sultana it
some time during the year under
management of the art department.
The president, Mrs. -Cureton in
her address appeals to all women to
take greater interest incrub work,
Bpeaking of its broadening influence
and great value in teaching women, '
toleration and the art of ''getting
along with each other.
Miss Esther Carlson and Mrs.
Lee sang solos at the conclusion
of the program.
Mrs. Etta Gifford Young, a pro
minent club woman from Phoenix,
was a guest of honor and spoke
briefly to the ladies. '
Miss Todd's Meeting A Frost
Miss Todd who was advertised
to address the voters of Williams
last Friday night on the 'shortcom-'
ings of the democratic party and
the advantage of supporting
Hughes as in aid to the cause of
woman suffrage did not get a very
good hearing. She certainly made
no converts and will make none,
nor will any of the advocates of the
policy of holding Mr. Wilson or
his party solely responsible for the
failure of Congress to enact legis
lation leading to the adoption of
the Susan B. Anthony Amend
ment. The position of the Wom
an's Party advocates is too illogi
cal to commend itself to the women,
voters of the suffrage stages..
