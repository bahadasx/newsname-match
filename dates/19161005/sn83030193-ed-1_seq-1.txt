Whllo the couplo lived together at

months, Mrs. Phlnnoy declared her
husband's letters to her during that
tlmo wero moro ardent than a suitor
usually writes his betrothed.
Mrs. Phluney, under direct exami

"Didn't you threaten to throw
vitriol In your .husband's face?"
asked Mr. Truesdale.
Mrs. Phlnnoy arose from tlio wit
ness chair and, striking tho Judgo's
desk with her gloved hand, loudly
replied:
"That Is absolutely false. I novor
did anything to humllluto or ourt
my husband-"
"Hut you bought a revolver nnd
hunted for days for your husband
with the purpose of shooting hm,
didn't you?" slio was asked.
"Why, I couldn't and wouldn't ut
tempt to uso a gun," declared Mrs.
Plie n 11 y.
"Well, when you found you couldn't
shoot your husband you threatened to
shoot his lawyers, didn't you?" was
asked.
"What would be tho use of shouting

"I went to his clubs and to Ills
