To the generous value heretofore present
in the Maxwell product, these extra im
provements have now been added.
This is in line with the Maxwell policy so
widely advertised not to change the
Maxwell in any essential detail, but to
continue improving it so that it will
always be a standard, recognized product,
constantly abreast of the best practices
of the industry.
Notwithstanding the superlative and
sometimes confusing claims that are
made in behalf of various automobiles,
we restate our sincere conviction that
Maxwell tyotpr Cam offer more real value

Dividend! Twice its Earnings Paid by
Bankers' Trust.
s (From St. Louis Post-Dispatch.)
. A remarkable showing of the boost
ing of valuations of Bankers Trust
Co. stock on the market by the pay
ment of nearly $1,600,000 in dividends
in an 8-year period when the net
- earnings of the company were less
than 9680,000, is contained in an audit
of the company's books, prepared by
Harry Q. Ambrose, tin expert ac
countant.' Ambrose has been sum
moned before the Federal Grand Jury,
which yesterday began an inquiry in
to Bankers Trust managemenU.
A compilation prepared by Am
brose shows that in 1906 Bankers
Trust stock was selling at 8160 a
share and that by 1914 it had advanc
ed on the market to $295, although in
only one year in that period had its
net earnings been as much as was
paid out in dividends and although
the bills payable of the company had
been increased from $500,000 to 81,
613,397.85. To secure this Indebtedness the
company by 1914 had pledged more
than $6,000,000 of Its assets and hav
ing virtually all its assets pledged,
could borrow no more money.
, Unable to borrow money, it could
not pay dividends, its stock declined
rapidly until it went as low as $20 a
share, Its quoted price when a receiv
er was appointed.
The audit that Ambrose is prepared
to show the Federal grand jury,
which is seeking to determine whether
there is basis for criminal charges
against any of those in control of the
affairs of the company prior to its
collapse, divides the business of the
company into eight periods, as fol
lows: In the first period, December 3,
1906, to February 2, 1 907, the net earn
ings amounted to only $36,723.90, but
$74,926 was paidindlvldends, $38,201.10
more than was earned. The bills
payable amounted to' $660,000, and
the stock was quoted at $160 a share.
Between February 12, 1907, and Feb
ruary 6, 1908, the net earnings were
$83,712.20, and of this $80,000 was paid
oat in dividends, this being the only
period In which the earnings were as
great as the dividends paid. The bills
payable, however, were Increased
by $130,000, reaching $080,000. The
stock went up to $162 CO.
From February 7, 1908, to January
80, 1009, the earning were only $40,-
233,29. but dividends amounting to

$180,000, were paid, $139,666.71 more
than was earned. The bills payable
increased nearly $50,000, reaching
$729,748.29. The big dividends paid
sent the Btock up to $175.
From January 31, 1909, to February
5, 1910, the earnings were $139,952.07,
and dividends paid amounted to 8180,
000, or $40,047.93 more than was earn
ed. In this period the bills payable
were reduced to $647,500. The seem
ing prosperity of the company, as
evidenced by the huge dividends paid,
sent the stock to $212 a share.
From February 6, 1910, to January
17. 1911, the earnings dropped to $68,
910.97, but the dividends remained at
a high figure, $160,000 being paid out
to shareholders, $91,089.03 more than
was earned. Again the stock climbed,
reaching $225. Also the bills payable
increased, this time nearly $400,000,
reaching a total of $1,022,147.86.
From January 18, 1911, to February
20. 1912, the earnings were $130,332.30
and $240,000 was paid in dividends,
$109,677.70 more than was earned.
The stock went to $270. The bills
payable were decreased to $972,000.
From February 21, 1912, to February
4, 1913, the earnings were $114,057 64,
and the dividends paid were $240,000,
or $125,942.36 more than was earned
The stock remained at (270. The
bills payable increased to $1,259,000.
From Februiry 6, 1913, to February
16, 1914, the earnings were only $30,
634.78, but the enormous dividend of
$360,000 was paid, Bending the stock
up to $296 on the market. In paying
this dividend the company increased
its bills more than $250,000, the total
reaching $1,613,397.85.
These figures from Ambrose's audit
show that in the eight years the total
net earnings of the company were
only $078,383, .80, and that $1,404,925
was paid in dividends, or more than
twice as much as actually was earned.
Progress of the Farm to Table Plan. ,
One of the greatest movements in
augurated by Postmaster General Al
bert S. Burleson during his admin
istration in the postal service is the
operation of the "Farm to Table''
plan as Initiated by Postmaster Colin
M. Selph of the St. Louis Post Offlce.
As soon as the plan was authorized,
Postmaster Selph immediately as
sumed personal supervision of its
operations. He at once saw Its great
advantages to both the producer and
consumer and in one of the most re
markable publicity campaigns con

This too, is the belief of the thousands
and thousands of Maxwell owners. And
these beliefs are supported by actual and
tangible facts. We actually know that
within the entire history of the automo
bile business, no motor car in any class
or at any price has equalled the Maxwell
in honest dollar-for-dollar value.
And if you will examine a Maxwell, ride
in it, compare it with other cars, consider
its splendid record, reputation and past
performances, you too, will know it.

IRONTON, MO,
mom
ducted in this State, he, in a very
snore period or time, naa forcibly
brought to the attention of the people
this added value of the parcel post
service.
The interest aroused was nnusual in
extent and indicated that the plan
from the start was to be a success.
The news items furnished by Post
master Selph were published in hun
dreds of Missouri newspapers and
copied in newspapers and magazines
from coast to coast.
As a result of this effective cam
paign of publicity, the shipments of
produce by United States Parcel Post
nave grown from month to month un
til in St. Louis alone, from 250.000 to
300,000 packages of perishable matter
are handled annually.
Tne producer and consumer have
been brought into closer touch with a
fuller understanding and appreciation
of the value of co-operation. Ship
pers have been instructed in the. man
ner of packing and through the con
stant vigilance on the part of Post
master Selph, employees are handling
packages with greater 'care so that
complaints have been reduced to a
minimum.
The objection to the parcel post
system that was formerly raised by
many merchants throughout the coun
try has practically beeu removed as
the merchants have become more ac
quainted with the real purpose of the
service. No effort has been spared
by Postmaster Selph to make it plain
to them that it was the intention of
the "Farm and Table" plan to assist
all classes of business as well as the
farm; that while the producer ships
bis products to the city, he receives
cash in return which he spends with
his local merchant and instead of tak
ing money out of the community it
increases the supply of actual cash.
It ia also found that in numerous in
stances producers are now shipping
to the city by United States Parcel
Post a great many of their farm
products which, for lack of ready
local market, would actually be wast
ed, so that the "Farm to Table" plan
serves a many-fold purpose by pro
viding the farmer with a ready cash
market who in turn supplies his vari
ous wants at the store of his local
merchant to whom be gives this cash
in return and it blesses the homes of
the city consumers by having deliver
ed at their door the best that the land
affords. ,

The Stamp Act is Repealed.
The stamp act, which has been in
effect since November 1, 1914, was
abolished by congress when the gen
eral revenue bill was passed just be
fore congress adjourned last week.
The emergency clause in the bill
made this provision effective at once
and there is rejoicing among the
business men who were forced to pay
the tax.
Under the repeal no tax will be paid
in the future on the two departmental
shedules "A" and "B." Hereafter
when yon send a telegram it won't
be necessary to pay the internal
revenue tax of 1 cent on your mes
sage, and the same will hold true in
the case of long distance telephone
messages. The local telephone ex
change will no longer collect 1 cent
extra from you every time you talk
over the long distance line.
The repeal of schedule "A" abol
ishes all taxes on notes, certificates
of stock, bills of lading, bonds, con
veyances and deeds, Insurance poli
cies, power of attorney, telephone
and telegraph messages.
Cosmetics, perfumes and all other
toilet. articles and chewing gum were
contained In schedule "B" and here
after they will be without the revenue
stamps.
The war tax on such articles as
contained in the two schedules was
effective November 1 1914,the bill
having been passed by congress and
approved on October 22 of the same
year. Under its, provisions the tax
was to extend over a period of 14
months, expiring automatically on
December 81, 1916, bnt at that time
congress extended It to embrace the
ensuing year.
Under the emergency bill signed by
Peesident Wilson Friday approxi
mately $200,000,000 will be gained by
the government. It provides for In
come inheritance, munitions, cor
poration stock, liquor and miscella
neous revenue taxes.
