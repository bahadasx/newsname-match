MissVernaE. Welborn, who
for the past four years has been
principal of the High Scnool
here, but is now teaching in the
High School at Senath, paid us a
very pleasant visit last week.
Miss Welborn is getting along
nicely in her new position and
we predict for her a very suc
cessful school year. Just now
Senath school is having a vaca
tion for cotton picking.
School was dismissed last Fri
day for the County Fair at Ca
ruthersville.On behalf of the chil
dren ot this district we wish to
thank the officials ol the Fair for
the complimentary tickets which
were sent to us. Judging from
the crowd ol school children
who attended, it is safe to say
that sixty per cent of the t'.ckeU
were used.
One of the attractions at thej
County Fair Friday forenoon i
was a game of football between
our boys and Caruthersville i
boys. Although outclassed fully'
12 pounds to the man, our bo.s
put up a plucky game.
t was plain to see that it was
pounds that won, as our boys
displayed superior team work
throughout the game; but being
outclassed so much in i.ize, tin
boys were unable to drive home
a play when once they had put it
in action. Our boys were de

An Educated Boy.
He is honest, hates a lie and
will not stand by and see a bully
tease a younger boy. He is po
lite. He lifts his hat to the ladies
and Is kind and considerate of
old people.
He docs not spend all his time
studying, but when a teacher as
signs a lesson he gets it thor
oughly. He is considerate of
dumb brutes, and protects the
birds. He is full of life as a
dynamo, and .when he plays he
plays hard but fair.
He is clean and pure in his
thought, life and habits. Not a
bully or a sissy but a gentle
man. He realizes that there are
a number of things that he does
not know and that his father and
his mother are his best friends.
When he tells you a thing you
know it is the truth, and above
all, he is a boy who can be
trusted. We honor him a boy
who is educated. Exchange.
feated but not discouraged by
no means; since they were en
abled to withstand the on
slaughts of such a large team it
has convinced them that a victory
is in store for them when they
go against a team of their size.
Kennett High School boys will
play our boys here October 13.
The game will be called at 2 p.
m. We hope everyone will keep
in mind the date and come out
and lend the boys your support.
This will be the only game of
football played in Hayti this sea
son. We are making our sched
ule short.
Report cards for the first
month will be delayed a few
days, but after this month we
will get them to the parents
promptly, and we hope they will
be examined carefully and re
turned promptly. Anytime you
think the report does not show
up properly consult the teacher.
It is our intention to cooperate
with parents for the betterment
of the children.

An Educated Girl.
She is honest, truthful and not
feiven to gossip. She thinks
more of her mother than of any
one else, "and spends more
thought on her lessons than on
the boys. She dresses plainly
does not bedeck herself with
cheap jewelry or extravagant cos
tames. She can converse intelli
gently without gigling inces
santly. She may chew gum oc
casionally, buthe-does not pub
lish the fact to the world, She
may be beautiful, but she does
not impress you as being con
scious of it. She knows that her
mother is capable of advising
her, and she respects the opin
ions of her father. She is ac
complished in the domestic arts
and practices them daily. She
thinks enough of her mother
that she often asks her to rest
while she finishes the task of the
hour. She is polite, considerate
of older people, and a friend to
the younger children. In public
gatherings she does not attract
attention by loud talking, cease
less whispering or commenting
on this or that.
She is sincere, sympathetic,
hospitable, and, above all, she is
a lady as such she will have the
respect of the entire community
and as such we honor her a girl
who is educated. Exchange.

Hereafter in Canada there will
be no Methodist Church, no
Presbyterian Church, no Con
gregational Church. These three
churches have been merged in
the membership, their property
and all their interests and will
become "The United Church of
Canada." This new church will
be the largest and most influen

that country, with 10,000 church
buildings, liOO.OOO actual church

them.

The contract for the construe,
tion of a concrete wall along the
Frisco right-of-way next to the
river front for the purpose of
affording protection from
future overflows was let last
Monday by the St, Francis Levee
Board, the lirm of Pierce & Pow
ers, of this city, being the suc
cessful bidders. The contract
price calls for $6.75 per cubic
foot for concrete work and 25c
per cubic foot for the necessary
excavation in setting the founda
tion for the wall.
As stated last week, this wall
will be something like 2,000
yards long, extending from the
Frisco spur above town to the
vicinity of the Dillman works be
low, and will average about eight
feet in height, ranging from five
to ten feet as the contour of the
surface may make necessary.
It will be about three feet higher
than the railroad dump, which
has heretofore furnished suffi
cient protection, and therefore
should be ample to provide for
all emergencies in future.
The work is to begin not later
than October 10th and the con
tract calls for completion by
December 1st. Some fear is felt
that it may be difficult to do the
concrete work at the season of
the year covered, owing to the
frosts and freezing incident to
the season, but the contractors
believe they will be able to com
plete it without a great deal of
trouble. It will be an excellent
thing for this city and the resi
dents will need to feel no fear
from possible overflows after it
shall have been constructed.
