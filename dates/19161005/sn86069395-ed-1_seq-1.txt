When Candidate Hughes is corn
ered by questions he pretends that
he does not hear them or makes
equivocal reply. While he was
speaking at Toledo, Ohio, the other
night ho was heckled by the audience
and among the the questions hurled
at him was "What about the Danbury
Honors' rcise?" He said afterwards
he did not hear it, but appeared to
maintain his silence when told of it.
This case was that m which the su
preme court, with Justice Hughes
ciHinfT. mnuired the unions which
boycotted the manufacturers to pay
them larce damages because of it.
Hon. Richard Olney, secretary of
Cleveland, disgusted at
Madisonville, Ky., Oct. 4. Mack
Logan, Buck Furgeson and Frank
Tribble, all of Dawson Springs, were
indicted by the grand jury hero this
afternoon, each charged with wilful
murder as the result of the killing of
Chief of Police K. H. Keach at Daw
son Springs, July 19, Last. Logan
has been in jail since the killing, hav
ing been refused bail. Tribble was
arrested this afternoon and the offi
cers have gone for Furgeson, who is
a constable in his district. The in
dictment of the three men created
much comment.
The trouble leading up to the kill
ing started when Dick Rodgers, who
had just been released from jail here,
where he had been sent for some
crime committed at Dawson, returned
to that place with a warrant against
Chief of Police Keach. The warrant
was placed in the hands of Constable
Buck Furgeson to execute and this
officer deputizsd Frank Tribble, Dick
Rodgers and Mack Logan to assist
him. The cjnstubje, read the warrant
tothochiQf andtft is claimed Keach
consented to accompany him, but
would not surrender his revolver.
Rodgers, it is claimed, appeared on
the scene then and pulled his revolver
and fired at Keach, missing. The
chief then whipped out his gun and
fired at Rodgers, the ball passing
through the heart.
SHOT FROM BEHIND.
Tribble aud Furgeson then caught
Keach and, it was stated by witnesses
at the examining trial, while they
were holding the officer's hands,
Mack Logan came up from the rear
and fired a shot into Keach's head,
killing him instantly.
At the examining trial Logan was
refused bond. Constable Furgeson
and Frank Tribble were held on bail
able charges and were released.
Marshal Keach had been a terror to
bootleceers" and in
H. H. Abernathy and J. W. Adams

today's first booster trip Monday and
Tuesday and found the people along
the route greatly "interested in the
visit to be made.
Meetings were held at the H. B. M.
A. both Monday and Tuesday nights

in ship shape for the trip.
They met with a cordial reception

crowds to hear the boosters. They

The evidence in the case ofT. J
Taylor, charged with killing Claud
Knight, in this city, Jan. 1, was con
eluded Teusday morning. Taylor
told his own story on the stand. He
said that Knight had enticed his wife
away from him on more than one ocj
casion, at one time going to Illinois
and finally returning to the Weaver'
Store neighborhood, where they re
sided. He also said Knight had threat
ened to kill him. He said he went to

drew his pistol and shot him.

The figures as analyzed this year
show 255 names short, of which 94
are Democrats and 161 Republicans.
A further analysis of the Independent
votes shows that about an equal num
ber of Democrats and Republicans,
including some colored Republicans,
have registered as Independents.
It may be fairly assumed that the
Independent votes will be an off-set,
which indicates a Republican major
ity of 42 as compared with 114 last
year.
The vote this year by color is as

REGISTRATION 1916.
London, Oct. 4. Although the Ru
manians continue to gain ground
against the Austro-Germans at various
points in Transylvania, the situation
in Dobrudja, which has attained added
ntercsts since the crossing of the
Danube into Bulgaria by Rumanian
forces remains uncertain.
Bucharest says that violent fighting
continues all along the line south of
the railroad running from Constanza
to the Danube with the Teutonic
allies offering stubborn resistance to
the Rumanian nnd Russian forces.
Nothing is said, however, concerning
the troops which invaded Bulgaria.
An official dispatch from Rome as
serts that Field Marshal von Macken
sen has ordered the evacuation of the
Dobrudja fortress of Silistria and
Turtukai, recently captured by the
Teutonic allies in the fear of their be
ing enveloped by the Rumanians.
Heavy rains are interfering with
the activities uf the iiiiushand French
armies in the Somme region of France
but nevertheless Paris records the
capture of an important trench north
of Rancourt and the taking of addi
tional prisoners, while London says
the fighting at Eaucourt l'Abbaye '"is
proceeding satisfactorily."
Violent fighting has been in pro
gress in Russia west of Lutsk and 111
Galicia in the region of the ZIota Li n
river.
As regards the fighting in Mace
donia, Sofia admits that the heavy
artillery fire of the Serbs in the region
of Kaimakcaian height caused the
Bulgarians to withdraw to the Mog-
lencia valley in order to avoid unnec
essary losses but assert that entente
attacks elsewhere alonu the front
were repulsed.

kition that way, a vpry lame excuse
since Mr. Hughes' party believes in
any means necessary to accompusu
their ends, and the stream is no high
er than its source. The fact is the
further Mr. Hughes goes tho worse
ho gets and the more disappointing
he becomes. For his reputation and
supposed ability Mr. Hughes has
nlado tho sorriest spectacle of him
self that a candidate of a party ever
did and the people as well as leaders
of his own party are disgusted with
him. It would have been thousands
of voters to his credit if ho had con-
. tinucd to maintain the silence after
his nomination that ho observed be

Upon the whole the registration is
very gratifying to the Democrats.
Their vote is registered fuller than
the Republicans and less than 30
Democrats have registered as Inde
pendents. The vote in the city last
'year showed that many Democrats
voted all or a part of tho Republican

that these will return to the party
