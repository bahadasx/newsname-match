Total Loss Will Not Exceed
Farmers state that rains and warm
er weather would greatly improve
conditions and materially lessen the
damage.
In the Red river valley, where the
•oil is heavy and where the land con
tains much moisture, the damage was
not very great. Larimore reported
the greatest damage, it being esti
mated that about 60 per cent of the
ferop was blown out in that section.
walhalla reports a damage of about
one-sixth on the total crop. About
one-half of the crop had been seeded,
and, it Is estimated, that about one
third of this amount was blown away.
It .is believed that the greatest effect
»f the storm will be to cut down the
acreage, aa about one-tenth will not

Hinted at Peace.,
New York, May 11—In response
to an appeal from llie Netherlands,
an anti-war council meeting, at
which will be oooaltlared a proposal
that President Wilson be urged to
promote a conference of neutral
nations to offer mediation In the
European war, will be called soon
in this country. This wa# announc
ed by Hamilton Holt, chairman of
Ute American branch of the central
organisation for Durable Peace, re
cipient of the appeal which urged
co-operation by American peace
societies in bringing' about media
tion.
The appeal of the Dntch eonaul,
according to Holt, indicates a be
lief by many persons in TheN6tl»er
landa that Emperor William,
through Germany's reply to the
American note In the submarine
controversy, made an Indirect bid
for peace. Holt will submit copies
of the appeal to various peace or

Wilson "for his Information." The
date of the ooqferenee i». expected

Officials Find "Motive" for
Alleged Murder of
Father.
(Herald Special Service.)
Carrington,, N. D., May 11.—The
motive for the alleged murder by An
fleld Shlflet of his father, Jos, Shlflet,
which was followed by the young
man's suicide when confronted by the
sheriff, was supplied today when it
became known that the father had
.taken out a $3,000 Insurance policy
several months ago in favor of the
young man.
In letter* ostensibly written by the
Elder Shifiet from Washington, D. C.,
after his disappearance, but which of
ficials say were written by the son, it
was stated that Jos. shifiet had deeded
the farm to his son, Anfleld, and that
the deed would be mailed in a few
days. This supplies a further mo
tive, officials say, as to young Shifiet's
previous career.
Officials find that there is nothing
to indicate the possibility that Anfleld
Shifiet killed his mother, her death
three years ago being clearly a sui
cide. Anfleld Shifiet's brother's- disap
pearance nine years ago, under cir
cumstances identical with those mark
ing the disappearance of his father, Is
still unexplained. Young Shlflet three
years ago faced federal charges Row
ing out of robbery of mails, white
handling a rural route out of Carring
ton.
INVESTIGATE THE
KIRBY FOUNDERING
Duluth, Minn., May 11.—The mat
ter of the foundering of the steamer
S. R. Klrby will be Investigated at
once. Captain C. ctooding, inspector
of boilers in the Marquette district,
in Which jurisdiction the Klrby was
lost, has been ordered by C. W. West
cott, ohlef inspeotor, to report to him
at the Sault at once to take up the
Investigation.
The Klrby was 21 feet deep. This
depth of hull, it is declared here, Is
expected to load about fourteen to
sixteen feet only, but It is alleged
from Ashland today that the veaSel
was loaded with ore to a draft of 18.6
feet forward and 19 feet aft, which
save the vessel. If this Is true, only
two feet free board, which, even In a
calm sea, puts the decks nearly
awash.
The united States vessel inspectors
here say that there Is no law for the
Great Lakes prescribing the depth to
which vessels can be loaded. On the
ocean the depth of loading Is pre
scribed by Lloyds and also by law.

Parliamentary Party Asks
Backing-for Constitu
tional' Movement.
Lopdon,. Miifr It.—The Irish parlia
mentary party has issued a manifesto
to the people of Ireland, calling up
on them to atopport the constitutional
movement as. the only one by which
their aspirations for self-government
can' poenbly-be realized.
"Another triMfedy," says the mani
festo,. !'has ..bean added to the long
tale of .trkgedW of Irish history. The
capital Of Irelnid has been the scene
of a mad and/wnsuccessful attempt at
revolution. Bwod has been shed
freely. It ftp «ue that Ireland has
been bitterly provoked by the growth
of a similar rMohttlonary and illegal
movement in •another part of Ireland,
backed- by an army in revolt, it Is
true that the grave responsibility for
these events.tat Dublin rests upon the
leaders of that movement. These
things will have to be discussed at
the proper time.
"It is true that Ireland has been
shocked .and horrified by a series of
military executl6ns by the military
tribunala In Dublin. These things
have been done in the. fact of inces
sant and. vehafnent protests of the
Irish leaders,: and these protests will
be pressed fltftitlnually and strongly
until the unchecked control of the
military authorities in Ireland is abol
ished. But If Is also true that, in
spite of .bitter provocations, the peo
ple of Ireland have had no hesita
tion in condemning -the rising in Dub
lin as a dangerous blow at the heart
and hopes of Ireland.
"On the morrow of this tragedy we
caltod updn to m&ke a solemn
appeal to the people of Ireland to
draw the conclusions which these
events force upon them. We must
leave no misunderstanding In their
minds as, to our convictions and our
resolves. EHther Ireland is to be giv
en over to a unsuccessful revolution
and anarchy, or. the constitutional
movement is to have the full support
of the Irish people and go on until It
has completed. Its work."
