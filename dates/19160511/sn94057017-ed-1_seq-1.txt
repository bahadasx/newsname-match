W. H. Hancock, formerly a
resident of the valley, now of
Las Vegas, came in last week
for a visit with old friends and
to look after business, and re
mained several days. Mr. Han
cock says that the valley looks
natural and familiar to him.
C. J. Wallace and family, old
settlers in the vicinity of Mc
intosh who left several years ago
and have been in California
since, were on Tuesday's train
bound for the old homestead.
Mr. Wallace says they have re
turned to stay.
It appears that George Mun-
shower got in the tree planting
game a year or two ago, and the
little trees in his enclosure look
very pretty now in their new
green dresses. George can sit
under the shade of his own trees,
if not his own vine and fig tree.
M. T. Dansby, a colored con
vict who was working at the Ti
jeras road camp, made his get
away a few days ago. Word
was sent to the officers here, and
J. A. Brittain and Frank Laws
gathered in the colored brother.
He was returned to the peniten
tiary at Santa Fe Tuesday.
Mr. and Mrs. M. H. Senter
picked up a lot of the trimmings
from the trees planted in town a
few weeks ago and planted them
on their ranch where they can
be watered by a windmill pump.
Nearly all of the cuttings are
growing and rooting nicely. In
a few years they will have more
trees than anybody.
D. S. King, who has been
working on his mining claim in
the Priest canyon district, re
turned to h3 home near Mc
intosh last Friday with his eyes
out of commission. He was
caught by a blow-out in his mine
work, and his eyes were so badly
injured that he will be disabled
for some time.
Willard, N. M., May 6. Word
has reached here of the finding
of a decomposed body of a man
about four miles north of Scholle.
It is thought the man had been
dead about one year. Also, the
remains of two horses, each one
showing a bullet hole in their
heads, were found. There was!
nothing to indicate the identity
of the man, and the whole
thing is a mystery. New Mexi
can. Monday was a warm day, per
fectly cloudless and calm, but
the air was full of very fine dust.
Looking at objects under a mile
distant the dust in the air was
not apparent, but it was there in
Buffcient quantity to obscure the
mountains so that but a faint
outline could be distinguished.
The theory of the wise ones is
that this dust was carried to a
great height by winds elsewhere,
and because of the absence of
wind settled down here.
Rex Meador is in Albuquerque
on business.
Ray Burrus is home from
school for the summer.
Mr. McClintock has rented the
Brown place west of town.
B. L. Fielder, Mrs. Pearl
Richards' father, is very sick

was here the first of the week
looking at cattle, but left with
out buying any.
Mrs. John Lasater, who went
to banta f e last week for an op-
eration on her throat, returned
to Estancia Monday evening.
H. Swayne and family, of
Shawnee, Oklahoma, came last
Thursday to visit the Crawf ords
west of town and at Moriarty.
Bert Ladriere, . a member of
the National Guard who has been
in Estancia several months, has
been ordered tj report for duty.
On last Friday the Milbourns
shipped to Kansas City the cattle
they had been feeding during
the winter. There were fifty
five head, and they were loaded
in two cars. The cattle had
been fed principally on silage,
but had some grain toward the
end of the period. - Most of them
looked very fine, and it was ex
pected that they would sell well.
The largest one weighed 1610.
The contractors who are drill
ing the wells on the state land in
the northeast part of this county
were in town yesterday.' It will
be remembered that the first
well, which was put down 800
feet, was a dry hole. They are
now at work on the second well
and are down between 700 and
800 feet. They have struck a
little water in this one, about two
and one-half gallons per minute.
At present they are hung up be
cause of the loss of some tools in
the hole.
Mr. Senter's accident with a
windmill last Thursday morning,
mentioned briefly last week, was
pretty serious. He lost the mid
dle finger of the left hand at the
middle joint, the end of the first
finger, and the other fingers are
badly lacerated. He will not be
able to make a full hand climb
ing poles for some time to come.
J. F. Lasater and H. C. Keene
sold two hundred head of two-year-old
steers last week, to be
shipped to Denver. They got
$42.50 per head. The steers
were driven to Willard to load.
The shorter haul would have
been to load here and transfer to
the Santa Fe at Kennedy, but
the Santa Fe and N. M. C. do not
seem to work together.
N. A. Wells invited a few
friends to dine with him at the
Valley Hotel May 9th to cele
brate his four score birthday.
He urged all to come as they
might not be here for his fifth
score. After dinner speeches
made by all present. T.
S Smith and Mrs. J. J. Smith
excelling. Some good stories
were told and a very enyoyable
time was had. A letter of con
gratulation from Mrs. Minnie
Brumback was read and very
much appreciated by all.
Eighteen cards of congratula
tions were received from the
Woman's Club and were cer
tainly appreciated. All hoped to
be present at the next "mile
stone." Those present were:
J. J. Smith and wife, John Berk
shire and wife, George Fenley
and wife, H. C. Williams and
wife and T. S. Smith. ,
Five antelope out of a bunch
of six were slain by game butch
ers and game law violators in the
Estancia valley last week, ac
cording to advicoa received by
the Santa Fe Game Protective
Association from Mr. Shearon, of
Moriarty. One buck escaped,
according to Mr. Shearon. The
matter has been reported by the
association to the state game
warden. In view of the fact
that the beautiful antelope are
almost extinct in New Mexico.
the crime is a shocking one and
the people of this section, sports
men and non-sportsmen alike
feel that prompt and effective
action should be taken to brim?

What do you think of a toll
bridge in the Estancia Valley?
Sounds strange, doesn't it? But
it is a concrete fact. For the
past ten days or more Mestenio
draw has been impassible for
automobiles except over a bridge
which Saturnino Lueras had
built in his pasture. The bridge
is not a very substantial affair,
and finally it occurred to Mr.
Lueras to make the consumer
pay the tariff. To be more ex
plicit, he conceived the idea of
makirig the travelers pay for ma
terial to build a better bridge.
So he put up a barrier and charg
es ' the autoists a fee to cross.
Many autoists have stuck in at
tempting to ford the draw, and
paid a much bigger fee to get
somebody to pull them out with
horses. Doctors Amble and Ma
son, who are among the heavy
sufferers, collected f40 by public
contribution to buy material to
build a bridge on the highway,
but the road authorities deem it
impracticable to build a bridge
now. So we are like the Arkan
sawyer with regard to his roof
wnen tne araw is running we
can't build a bridge, and when
it isn't we don't need it. So the
matter remains "in statu quo"
for the present, and Mr. Lueras
continues to collect either bridge
toll or a fee for pulling the luck
less autoist out of the mud.
Torre√≥n draw is -giving trouble,
too. It is carrying a pretty large
volume of water down to the
railroad track, and while the
autoists are having trouble cross
ing it, the railroad people are be
ginning to . be apprehensive cf a
soft track. What a great pity it
is that the great volume of water
carried down by these two
draws could not be impounded
and used for irrigation.

VOLUNTEERS WANTED
Estancia got a little thrill
Wednesday when word came by
phone from Capt. Safford of
Santa Fe, asking how many
volunteers for bordur service
could be enrolled from this coun
ty. Of course nobody could tell
how many might want to go.
However, it was arranged that a
recruiting officer would come,
and meanwhile the following
notices were issued:
"vVanted, Volunteers. Men
are wanted for border service.
Recruiting officer will be in Es
tancia in'a few days, and mean
while those willing to vo'unteer
are asked to phone or call at the
sheriff's office."
"Se Necesitan Voluntarios.
Sa Necesitan hombres para el
servicio en la frontera. Oficiales
Recrutantes estaran en Estancia
en pocos dias. Mientras, los que
drseen entrar en servicio se les
suplica de telefoniar o llamar a
lai ficinadel Alguacil Mayor.1'
Presumably the men are want
ed to fill up the ranks of the New
Mexico National Guard, which
has been ordered into service by
the government The National
Guard of Texas and Arizona also
has been ordered out. The gov
ernor of Texas has also ordered
out the Texas Rangers.
Of course nothing is known
positively at this time of the
plans of the government, but the
presumption is that these troops
will be used for border patrol.
thus releasing the regulars for
service wherever needed.
Do any of our readers know
George E. Ritter, ranchman of
the state of Durango, in Mexico?
He came into Estancia last
Thursday on foot, and said he
had walked from Eagle Pass,
Texas. He was on his way to
Albuquerque, where he thinks
he can procure the means to live
until it is safe for him to return
to his ranch in Mexico. His con
versation is interestitiz. and one
of his statements in particular is
more than interesting if true
He says he has been in Mexico
nineteen years, and in partner
ship with three other men, two
of them natives, owns a large
ranch in the mountainous coun
try northwest of the city of
Durango, with thousands of hepd
of horses, mules, cattle and
goats. He is an intimaU: iiiend
of Villa, the now famous bandit
having worked for him as a
freighter eighteen years ago.
And here is his statement that is
more than interesting: He says
he talked with Villa on his ranch
the evening previous to the
Columbus raid, and again the
next evening, and frequently
since, until he considered it wise
for himself to Quit the country.
This is 450 miles from Columbus.
According to Ritter's statement
Villa has had his camp where it
now is, in the mountains near
the Ritter ranch, ever since his
marriage to that fourth wife
that the bandit is devoting his
entire attention to this lady, with
hunting and fishing as a side is
sue to his amorous devotions
and that he couldn't be Dulled
away from there with a six mule
team.
Ritter says the fact that he is
a refugee is due to his friendship
for Villa, which has gained him
the bitter enmity of the Car-
rancistas. He says that Villa is
perfectly safe from the Carran-
cistas where he is; that he could
call ten thousand men to his
standard at any time he so de
sired, and that his enemies in
Mexico could never take him and
know better than to trv. Thev
know where he is, but they don't
want to see him.
Kitter's flight was due toa
raid on his ranch by Carrancistas
and the fear that the U. S sol
diers might get down there to
help them, the advance guard
having been within eitrhtv miles
of his ranch. In that event his
only safety would be with Villa.
and he did not want to be drawn
into fighting against the United
States.
Hence he decided that as he
must otherwise join Villa he had
better make an effort to get
across the Kio Grande.
He had to make a run for it,
and left with a single companion
in an automobile. He went by
way of Torre√≥n and San Pedro.
crossing the desert from the lat
ter place to Monclova. and thence
to Piedras Negras. Here 'he an
ticipated danger in applying to
the Carranza officials for a pass
port, and so decided to force the
issue. He made a run for the
bridge at such hisrh BDeed that
the guards were taken by sur
prise and could do nothing but
get out of the way ac both ends
of the bridge. He was quickly
out of sight of the guards, but
had to stop for something to eat.
and was found by a soldier who
summoned him before the com
manding officer. He decided not
o face this trouble, and a his
companion had been passive and
was unlikely to have serious
trouble over the affair, the auto
mobile was left in the possession
of the latter and Ritter slirmed
out and made his escape on foot.
lie made hi3 way to San Antonio
and thence by way of Lubbock
to New Mexico with the desien
of reaching Albuquerque.
This in brief is Kitter's story.
and if it isn't true, it is an inter
√©s' ing romance.
He is a well informed man of
much force and ability. That
much is true beyond any doubt
He speaks German and S√ºan-
ish fluently and his English has
a broad German accent.
He is a tall, well made man.
bronzed, muscular and strong.
He was well dressed and clean.
While being drawn out by a rep
resentative of this paper he
showed high nervous tension,
and was very bitter against Car
ranza.
Asked the cause of the break
between Villa and Carranza,- he
said it was because Carranza
grabbed the Standard Oil money
and wouldn't divide; that Villa is
a bandit by instinct as well as
practice, knows he isn't fit to be
president of Mexico, never want
ed to be and laughed at the idea,
and that anybody who knows
Villa doesn't need to he told that
he wasn't at Columbus, where
