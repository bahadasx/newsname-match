Dazey's New Hotel Is
Opened for Business
Dazey Commercial: Dazey's new
$18,000 hotel was opened for business
on Monday of this week. The build
ing is one of the finest in this section
of the country and is modern in every
way possible for a hotel in a country
town. The new proprietor, Otto Mar
quardt, is an enterprising young busi
ness man and will no doubt give the
very best service to all patrons. The
meals served are of the best, both in
quality and quantity. It has been so
long since Dazey has been able to
boast of a hotel that is seems almost
too good to be true. Let us all boost
in every way we can for the new en
terprise.
The cottage owned by the Synod
Lutheran people, forrtterly the John
Enerson house, is being moved to the
western part of the city. It was pur
chased by Dr. Platou and will be mov
ed on one of the doctor's lots. The
Synod people will begin building oper
ations at once, and will build about
an eight-room modern house for their
parsonage. They expect to have it
finished and ready for occupancy
around the latter part of August or
early in September. This property
was purchased by the Synod Lutheran
church about two years ago from Mr.
Enerson, and is one of the most de
sirable residence locations in the city.
A. J. Nelson, of Vancouver, B. C., is
visiting at the home of his mother and
sister, Mrs. M. Hopperstad and Miss
Jennie Nelson, on Eighth avenue. Mr.
Nelson expects to make an indefinite
stay here, and later will go to North
wood, to visit another sister, Mrs. C.
M. Hanson, who is a former resident
of this city. The many friends of Mrs.
Hopperstad will be interested to know
that she is now able to get around a
little on crutches, after her serious
accident of last winter.
Palmer Enerson, who is attending an
electrical engineering school in Mil
waukee, Wis., writes his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. John Enerson, that he has
as his guests Mr. and Mrs. Oscar
Mason, who visited with him over
Saturday and Sunday. Palmer eex
pects to return to Valley City some
time in June, following the close of
school, which will be good news to his
Valley City frieids.
Mrs. M. R. Nelson, Mrs. M. E. Ma
son, Mrs. E. M. Lavery, Mrs. Casper
Winkler, Mrs. E. Kennedy, Mrs. R. H.
Bailey and Miss Mary Stibel returned

Dazey, where they spent Thursday and
Friday attending the district conven
tion of the Rebekah lodge.

Right Price Displays
Great Summer Stock
The Right Price has just finished un
packing what is probably the largest
stock of summer goods they have ever
carried, a stock which, to be exact,
would be creditable in a city much
larger than Valley City. The goods
were bought early last fall, before the
shortage in dyestuffs began to be felt,
and the dainty colors and shades will
be a pleasing sight to the ladies of the
city.

Valley Hotel Is Making
Several Improvements
Before the end of this week the of
fice of the Valley Hotel will have been
moved into the lower floor of their
block on Main street. The Gill stock
has been moved into the west room
and the room vacated is now being ar
ranged for the use of the hotel. Neat
gold lettering on the windows will an
nounce the new location of the office
and the change will no doubt result in
an increased business for this popular
hotel.
Among other improvements the Eat
Shop has been moved from the base
ment to the ground floor, and in a short
time telephones will be installed in
each room. Manager Hamilton has
proved that he knows the hotel busi
ness thoroughly and the changes be
ing made will add to the popularity of
his house.
