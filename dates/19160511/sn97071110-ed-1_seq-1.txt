The 'Buy at Home Week' should be ex
tended indefinitely for the benefit of any
community. Most vegetables shipped any
distance and going through a half a dozen
jobbers and manufacturers hands are way
too high in price and sometimes unfit in qual
ity for use in a community like Hood River
Therefore, it is good policy and we should
advise any consumer that wants to be eco
nomical and get his money's worth and to
keep it at home to buy Koberg's Non-Pareil

CASCADE CANAL
COST$3,000,000
RIVER OPENED NOVEMBER 5, 1896

lombia Barrier is Surprising to
Motor Visitors
Actins under an act of congress,
passed June 23, 1874, which provided
for a survey of the cascades and the
dalles of the Columbia river, "for the
purpose of ascertaining the practicabil
ity and cost of constructing; canals and
locks at these points," Major N. Mich
ler in the fall of 1874 began the first
work preparatory to the construction
of the Cascade canal and locks.. The
party of engineers was under super
vision of Robert A. Habersham, later
surveyor general of Oregon. Captain
Allen Noyes, who later became captain
of a river steamboat and on retiring
made Portland his residence, was a
rodman of the party. Major Michler
in his report to Brigadier General A. A.
Humphreys, at tbat time chief of en
gineers, estimated the cost or con
structing a canal and locks at (700,000.
The total cost of the work, however,
reached the sum of 3,793,496.94.
While the eanal was opened to river
traffic on November 5, 1896, Lthe south
wall of the upper lock chamber waa
not completed until July of 1914. Ad
ditional surveys were made of the lo
cation in 1876 by C. M. Bolton, and a
report was submitted to chief of engin
eers on February 5, 1877, by Col. J.
M. Wilson. Bids for the construction
work were opened on October 1, 1878,
and the contract was awarded to Ball
& Piatt, of New York city. On De
cember 21 A. H. Ball arrived and be
gan work with a crew of men. Opera
tions, however, were delayed by Mr.
Ball s death just two weeks afterward.
Later the contract expired and the
government purchased the equipment
of the New York contractors, and from
December 3, 1879, to September 30,
1892, government carried on construc
tion work with hired labor, cut be
cause of lack of appropriations very
little was accomplished. Between
August 13, 1881, and February 28, 1882,
David Uhalmtrs and wm. . Holmes,
of Portland, under contract made exca
vations at the lower end of the canal.
On December 20. 1892, a contract for
the completion of the work was award
ed to J. G. & I. N. Day, of San Fran
cisco. I. N. Day has since become a
resident of Oregon, and has played a
prominent part in legislative circles of
the state, having been a leader in the
state senate.
The first boat to pass through the
completed locks was the Sadie B, which
was closely followed by the Dalles
City, the Harvest Queen and the Sarah
Dixon. Ihe average annual operating
expenses of the canal and locks, in
cluding labor and expenses for mainte
nance, will reach in round figures $4000.
A record waa made at tne iocks in
1905, the year of the Lewis & Clark
exposition at Portland. During that
year 1,217 boats, carrying a total of
133.07U pasengers, passed inrougn ine
canal.
While no boat has ever passed over
the cascades on an op river trip, on
several occasions daring captains have
run their craft over the rapids on down
stream journeys.
The total length oi tne canal at uas-
cade Locks is 3.000 feet. The canal is
90 feet wide on the extreme lift and 24
feet at low water. The height of the
middle sates is 40 feet above the sill
and tbat of the lower gates is 46 feet.
The upper lock chamber is 521 feet;
the lower. 514.2. The canal is de
signed to carry boats drawing eight
feet of water. The gates are operated
bv hvdraulic power secured by a 10-
inch pipeline laid to a little stream two
miles back oi tne tne iocks.
Dunns the record high wster or the
Columbia in 1894, on June 6 a record
mark of 49.7 feet above low water
mark was reached at the Locks. The
stream ran over the top of the upper
ward gates. Plans were then made for
-. . m a. l j
the construction oi a movauie gam,
five feet higher than the level of the
unoer works, designed to send the cur
rent down the canal and protect th
side works. If predictions of river

W. L. Clark, a civil engineer who is
engaged in business here at the present
time, was superintendent or ine iocks
for four years. Since 1907 Val W.
Tomkins has been in charge. A full
eauinned machine shop is maintained
and an adequate crew of men kept at
the locks. The men snd their famines
are housed in commodious quarters lo
cated on well kept grounds. Passen

:anning company
announces price
The Hood River Canning Company in
announcing prices to be paid for fruit
this season desires to call attention to
the following facts:
r our cents per pound will be paid lor
atrawberries upon delivery and your
crate back. You know exactly what
you are getting. And you can use these
crste over and over again. Last sea
son some crates were used 11 times.
Our canned fruits are making a
splendid reputstion for Hood River
wherever they go. The principal rea
son for this Is that they are canned
soon after being picked, retaining all
of their original flavor and firmness.
Nothing is lost. And that is where
the grower makes money by dealing
itb us.
In strawberries we wsnt the fully
ripe fruit. This enables the grower to
How the fruit to remain longer on the
vines to gain in weight. A crate of
good canning berries will weigh more
than a shipping berry. The sooner the
berries are delivered after being picked
the better it is for the grower, as there
is no loss in shrinkage.
Fresh berries are easier - to stem.
thereby enabling our women employes
to make more wages. It will thus be
seen tbat II you take particular pains
to ' bring in thoroughly ripened, fresh
fruit, you enable us to put up a much
better article, you make more money
yourself by securng the maximum
weight, and you assist a number oi
deserving employes to make better
wages.
Another point to be considered.
When you get resdy for field picking,
just give your strawberry field a good
thorough soaking, and note the great
increased yield of fine berries.
Four cents per pound will be paid lor
cherries as they come from the tree
(tree run). This is absolutely net to
you. without selling charges or dis
counts of any kind taken out of it. And
also, your box back.
The advantage of allowing the cher
ries to fully ripen on the tree is even
grester than it is with berries. You
will gain at least 25 per cent in addi
tional weight than if you shipped your
cherries to outside points.
A fully ripened cherry with plenty of
color is exactly what we need for the

BERRY FMflVAL
ISPROPOSED
BLOSSOM WEEK MAYBE RELEGATED
Wait Until Jane, Says W. J. Davidson, and
We Will Not Be Bothered With
Inclement Weather
A suggestion of W. J. Davidson, a
West Side fruit grower, who proposes
celebrate annually the strswerry
harvest instesd of the apple blossom
season, will no doubt receive endorse
ment from local citisens after the
flurry of the elements last week end
and on Sunday.
"Let us csll the proposed berry cele
bration." says Mr. Dsvidson, "a Clark
Seedling festival,. By June 1 we are
having weather that can be depended
on to be good. The roads from Port
land and other cities would then be at
their best. We might well expect to
have hundreds of visitors come here by
automobile. How often have we been
hagrined in the past at blossom season
because of inclemency of the weather.
"1 would say tbat it would be a good
advertisement for us to feed our visit
ors at the berry harvest season on as
much strawberries and cream as they
could eat. We now produce tine Jersey
cream, and everybody knows that our
Clark seedling strawberries bsve do
equal."
Weather of all our seasons prevailed
here in the 24 hours from five o'clock
Saturday evening till the same time
the next evening. - Snow fell in the
Upper Valley and on the surrounding
high points Saturday night White
capped peaks greeted the eyes of resi
dents and visitors alike on Sunday
morning as they gazed across at tha
Underwood orchard district and tne
bald points east of White Salmon.
However, by 8.30 o clock the brilliant
sunshine that prevailed part of the day,
had melted the white blanket
Despite the weather conditions Hood
River hsd a fair number of visitors.
A score of sutomobiles csme here from
Portland over the Columbia river high
way, and the u-.w. k. & . local sun-
day morning added a number to the
igbtseers. The hotels were xairiy
well filled with guests. -
Yet. because of the poor weather,
Hood River people will look back at tha
blossom celebration of 1916 and think
of what it might have been if tha
weather had remained good.
The cold rains are said by growers
to have caused no serious damsge to
fruit However, reports from over the
state indicate that the cherry, prune
and pear crops of other sections will be
materially reduced. Young gardens in
eastern Oregon were frozen.
FROST CAUSES NO
DAMAGE TO APPLES
While no frost damage has been re
ported by the fruitgrowers of the Hood
Kiver valley, tne past week oi prevaii-
ng cold rains and damp, cloudy days
took toll of the cherry crop. The dam
age to cherries because of failure of
blossoms to pollenize is placed at 25
per cent While as yet no damage is
apparent to apples, it is porbable that
the rainy weather win result in a lack
of pollemzation and cause a drop of
the young fruit later. Growers, how
ever, say that this will be a benefit
rather than a damage, as it will elim
inate the cost of heavy thinning during
the summer months.
E. L. Smith, a pioneer grower of the
valley and formerly president of the
Oregon State Horticultural Society,
ssys thst he has compared the temper
atures of the Hood River valley at the
frost damage season of the year with
those of other sections of the United
States, as compiled by B. S. Pague,
formerly director oi the united states
weather bureau at Portland, and the
local records show the highest temper
atures during that time.
Local records show that in the his
tory of the valley no damsge has ever
been caused to the apple crop because
of frost.
CALYX APPLICATION
SHOULD BE MADE
"It Is well to begin the application
of the calyx spray as soon as possible,"
ssys LeRoy Childs, acting superintend
ent of the experiment station. "We
are finding the secondary infection just
begining to take place. In view of tha
fact that young apples and a large
area of new foliage is unprotected, the
application is indeed needed.
"The serious infection of last year
occurred at this time. The present un
settled weather conditions indicate a
duplication of last year's infection, if
careful spraying is not unoertaxen.
"The experiment station recommends
lime-sulphur, 1-35, if the weather is
cool ; 1-40 in esse the weather is warm.
Add atomic sulphur at the rata of five
or six pounds together with arsenate
of lead, 6-100, for control of codling
moth. It must be understood that no
guarantee against foliage injury can
be made : for burning is liable to occur
under certain weather conditions. How
ever, lime-sulphur is the most effective
scab remedy. Much less injury will
result from a little burning of foliage
than from the spread of scsb infec
tion." Portland Bikers Stop Here
Kenneth Hollister, Raymond Mayer
and William Simonson, the three Port
land boys who are walking to New
York, arrived here Tuesdsy afternoon
over the Columbia river highway. The
boys were wsrmly welcomed by the
Commercial club members and mer
chants. With comfortable quarters at
tbe Hotel Oregon, the boys remained
here until today, giving entertainments
at the Electric theatre.
"We certainly received a rebuff at
Cascsde Locks, where we spent Mon
day night," says Hollister. "The hotel
and business men turned us down abso
lutely, and wo were forced to spend
the night in tha sawmill of the Wind
River Lumber Co. with the watch-,
man."
