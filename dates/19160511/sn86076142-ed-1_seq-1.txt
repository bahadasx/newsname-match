EL PASO, May 11. General Funs
ton desires to strengthen the border
patrol by mounting- 2000 infantrymen
on Texas ponies. Hid plans make the
recommendation to Secretary Baker
bncauae the available forces of cavalry
for the patrol ia virtually exhausted.
When recess was taken, General
Scott said he uiight have something
to any: "When we meet again at four! a
o'clock."
In the district court thia afternoon
Judne Averill entered an order on
the motion for a new trial In the case
of I,. F. Clar vs. Jos. Plourd, et al.
On all jtoints and contentions of the
defendants but one, the motion for a
new trial in overruled and denied. But,
unless the plaintiff will consent to a
reduction of $500 in the amount of
damages awarded him within fifteen
days from the date hereof, a new trial
In granted for the purpose only of a
reconsideration of the amount of dam
ages to the ttoubust Claim
It was ordered, that a new trial be
granted for the purpose only of a
re-estimate of the damages to the Ro
bust claim, unless within fifteen days-
from the date the plaintiff's consent
in writing Is filed with the clerk to
reduction of the damages hereto
fore awarded herein from $2,000 to
$2,000; and it was furtner ordered that
if said consent be so filed that a new
trial be denied, a minute order of the
court to be made at the expiration or
,the said period to complete thla rul
ing. The above refers only to the
item of damages and does not affect
4he award of $400 for gravel taken
from the Erwln fraction, which award
stands.
The motion for a new trial was
based upon the ground of newly dis
covered evidence which could not have
been secured In time for the trial
consisting of two Items, first, that
Ihe Pedro fraction is the same as the
Erwln fraction, and, second, that Sur
i'eyor Ltddell's evidence changes tlie
boundary line of the Pedro claim from
what It was found to be by the court
upon the trial of the cause. There
was also a suggestion of a third
ground In the affidavit, of price that
the damages awarded on behalf of the
Robust claim were excessive.
