Klamath Falls people are all elated
over Governor Wlthycombe's an

Chas. F. Stone aa a member of the
state fish and game and commission.
The work Stone haa done In tho paat
flvo years has been much appreciated
here, and all sportsmen are glad to
know that be will bo on tho board for
four years mora. J
In announcing hla intention of re
appointing Stone, Governor Withy

"I did not' Intend to take definite
action In tbe premises until May U, I
but Inasmuch aa friends of other peo

Killed in Klamath county was con
dnued for another thirty daya, or
until June 1st. As a result, there is
un r-ilded incentive for tho killing of

Tho court, however, lowered the ape.

KL PASO, May 11. Obregon visited
General Scott this morning, and It Is
expected that be will soon submit a
plan for the: co-operative border pa
trol. This la believed to be the last
hope of tho Carranzlstas in efforts to
avert .a deadlock.
General Scott ia powerless to decide
regarding the withdrawal of American
troops. Aa a result, there is a possi
bility of negotiations shifting to Wash
ington. Militia regiments are now rushing to
concentration.
General Funaton is seriously consid
ering requesting the First Illinois cav
alry, a crack Chicago militia regiment,
for border patroL The regiment has
mounts ready, and the men are in
splendid trim.
The shortage of cavalry has led Fun
st on to request permission to mount
2,000 infantrymen aa provisional caval
rymen. No comment la made upon the report
that General Funston haa abandoned
his line la Mexico below Dubtan.

DAY'8 CONTEST
Manager Watt of the localb baseball
club today wired transportation, to
Lyle Blgbee, star twirler on laat year's
club. With this information for the
local fans, local baseball stock Is
booming.
Blgbee Is perhaps the fastest pitcher
ever seen in this section, and be can
play the outfield equally as well. Hla
hitting will help the team wonderfully,
and his record for last year Is still too
well known to need any comment
Blgbee leaves at once for Klamath
Falls, and will be here for Sunday'a
game with the Yalnax Indians. Thla is
to be the last practice game -of tha
season, the Weed game being advanced
a few weeks to allow Weed time to
complete her line-up.
However, the addition of three new
players on the Reds' team does not as
sure any walkaway for the home guard
and, anyway, the admission la only two
bits, and tt helps the boys to have a
good turnout in the stands and bleach
era, so come and look the "wrecking
crew" over.
Bring Trout Eggs.
Deputy Game Warden Henry Stout
and Henry Ketxdever returned laat
evening from a trip to tho Lake county
flab hatobery. They brought over four
boxea, about 300,000 trout eggs, for
