The registration books closed Inst
night In so fur as the registering under
all ordinary circumstances is affect
ed. However, for the reason that a
number of qualified voters, entitled to
registration, have not been registered,
County Registrar Bob Murray, has in
utructed al precinct registrars to hold
their books open for one week from
last night for the accommodation of
such voters. .
Those who will be permitted to reg
ister during the coming week will be
the ones who were prevented from
ngistering on account of unavoidable
reason, in hiding forced absence from
, their registration precincts on account
of busineaM or sickness and those who
voted in the general election of 19H,
mid wer det.led the right to register
through error on the part of the pre
cinct registrars.
Mr. MiMiay stated this morning that
he had not received returns from any
of the precinct registrars, officially,
, aud that he had mailed omrh registrar'
a letter authorizing the holding oien
'of tho rcglttra"on books for the time!

chairman of the county democratic
central committee, stated however,
that he thought the city of Cblcka
t.ha would show a material gain over
the vote cast in 19M. Mr. Mutton
stated that the gain shown in the
registration books was a logical one,
based upon the increase in Chicka
Bha's population and would be, he
thought, p.oportionaely divided politi

Mr. Coiper slays that there are too

of the farmers of the cc inty call him
whenever they want or need farm
hands and a number of places are al

there has been an average of three
applicants for every one position.
Some of the applicants, Mr. Cooper

that the judge assessed him punish

added on to that a fine of $50, together
with the costs in the sum of approx
imately 20, thereby bringing the cost
of the suit' of clothes and the extra
trousers purloined by the lad up to
100 day? of good, hard, honest toil
on the county roads under a broiling
sun.

of a job: Just before the fellow came
into Mr Cooper's office, a farmer liv
ing near Amber had phoned for a
hand to work in the garden, prom
ising a week's work to a good man
with .willingness to sweat. Mr. Cooper
told the man of the job. He said:
"This job will pay you a dollar a day
and board and the chances are that it
will lead to your employment for the
summer. Do you want the Job?"
The m.';n said he did. Then Mr.
Cooper told the fellow that he was
going to drive to Amber that afternoon
in his auto and that he could ride
out with him. When the time came
for Mr. Cooper to make the start for
Amber, however, the man-hungry-for-work
was an unknown quantity in and
about th ! neighborhood of the farm
bureau. Mr. Cooper went out on a
still hunt and found the man only to
be informed that he had "changed
his mind," and did not believe ho
wanted that kind of a Job.
Mr. Cooper says that ten days or
