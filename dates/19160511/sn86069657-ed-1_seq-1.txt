have used the same system as when
ho said
"It coBt Adair county, including Su
perintendent's salary, and all other ex
penses. to send 8t8 pupils to 80 schools
dally the term, 14105.03:"
On page 183 of Ky. School Report we
sea there the salary of Adair's Super
intendent was $l,OU0.UO per year. We
don't know what the "other expenses"
amounted to, but just take off the
11,000.00 ana it leaves $2,405 03 to bo
divided between 80 schools, which
would be a little less than $27.70 for
each school. Thai would not pay the
salary of one teacher one month 1
Bo ynu see how. rediculous suuii a
statement, Mid there is just as much
in most of the others he makes In re

a few days ago that wo.should not ex

mother, along the lines laid down
by, the "Divine Healers". Al
though tho little one had been
ill tor some days no medicine of
of any kiud was given it, but Dr.
W. C. Martin was called to
diagnose the ailmeut, aud he told
the parents, that it hnd developed
spinal meuiugitis from teething
trouble, ana that unless, it received-Immediate
treatment it.
would die, but that he cooTd!- re
lieve its sufTering and possibly
eirect uncomplete cure, by treat
ing it. This the parents refused
to allow him to do, declining
even to give the child a laxative
although it had a high fever and
was suffering considerable pain.
As a part of the treatment the
mother hud fasted for several
days, and consequently had uo
nurse for the child, nnd' in iu
weakened condition it was unable
to assimilate any other food.
