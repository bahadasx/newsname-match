FOREST FIRE BURNS
OVERJOO ACRES
A forest fire near the Saginaw
camps, burned over a area of 600
acres, the first of the week, before
it was stopped. The fire was dis
covered Sunday, and the high
wind that day was largely responsi
ble for the difficulty experienced in
putting out the blaze.
Before the conflagration was
over, all of the men at the two Sag
inaw camps and all other available
men had been called into service.
Mr. Greene, local Forest Super
visor, left by auto for the scene of
the fire, Monday morning, and re
turned Tuesday. The fire was
completely under control and for
the most part extinguished, by
Tuesday. ,
A.H of the timber burned waa-in
the district belonging to the : Sag-,
in aw Manistee Lumber Co. No
estimate ot the loss is as yet avail
able. This is one of the most serious
fires that has occured for several
years. . - ,

passengers made the remarkable
record of climbing the Ash Fork
hill on intermediate gear. The
climb was made on a wager. The
Maxwell made the climb success
fully two times with ease.

power. 1 here are but a few makes
of cars that have succeeded in
climbing this hill on intermediate,
even when less heavily loaded.

ENGINEER TUCKER SEVERELY
INJURIED BY EXPLODING GUN
Mr. J. B. Tucker, engineer on
the Grand Canyon run, was sev
erely injured Monday, by an ex
ploding gun. A piece of metal
lodged in his eye and he was
rushed to Los Angeles for an
operation.
The accident occured while
Mr. and Mrs. Tucker were rid
ing in. an automobile with Mr.
Hibben. Mr. and Mrs. Tucker
occupied the back seat. Mr.
Tucker stood up and shot at a
prairie dog. For some unknown
cause, the gun exploded and a
piece of metal was buried in Mr.
Tucker's left eye. The accident
occured near the town of Grand
Canyon. v
Dr. Melick was called and rush
ed to the Canyon by auto. By
the time he arrived, the eye had
swollen so badly that it was im
possible to tell whether or not
sight would be lost in the injur
ed eye. Dr. Melick ordered that
the patient be taken to Los
Angeles to be operated upon by
an eye specialist. The, eye 'was
packed in ice and opiates admin
istered to relieve the pain.
Mr. Tucker was brought in on
the Grand Canyon train Monday
night and left on No. 3 for Los
Angeles, accompanied by Mrs.
Tucker.
A wire was sent to Seligman
to have the doctor there meet
the train and administer, addi
tional opiates. A wire was sent
to Los Angeles, also, to Dr.
Miller, the eye specialist, asking
him to meet the train with an
ambulance. .
The local trainmen and officials
saw that every thing possible
was done to aid Mr. Tucker, arid
it is hoped that the the sight of
his eye may yet be saved.

TWO OFFICES WEST END
OUGHT ALWAYS TO GET
As the time for the primary elec
tion draws near, we hear consider
able discussion on the streets con
cerning available candidates for
the offices that are to be filled.
For the past four years the west
ern end of the county has not been
particularly fortunate in securing
the election of that quota of her
candidates for the various county
officers to which its wealth and
population entitle it. We are not
in a querulous or complaining
mood, but merely make this state
ment as a fact in order to impress
it upon the minds of the leaders of
the political parties, in the hope
that at the forthcoming primary
they will select the best men obtain
able as their candidates at the ,
November election.
There are two offices to be filled ,
which the generosity of our friends
in the east end of the county will
possibly concede belong to us. Up '
to within the past four jears there
existed within both the democratic ;
and republican parties an Xinwrit
ten, tentative agreement to .. the
county was entitled to the etate
senatorship and the western end to
the legislative representative. Why,
in justice to the interests, of both
sections of the county, can this old
understanding not be renewed?
But possibly the one office in
which the taxpayers of western
Coconino are most generally in-
tereeted . is that of electing one
member of the board of supervisors.
The justice of our claim in this
respect was recognized .; iu all por
tions of the county at the last :
election, and through the splendid
support given Hon. R. T. Brown
in the eastern end , :of the county, r
he was elected. Mr. Browtr has
announcd his determination not to .
seek reelection. It therefore be
hooves the Democrats in this- end
of the county to take an inveutory
of their available timber for this
important office, and to unite upon
and support their strongest man.
A number of good men have al
ready been suggested, and within
the past week the name of Mr. W.
C. Rittenhouse has been added to
toe list. He has not, as yet, con
sented to make the race; but his
friends are certain that if he will
do so, he will make one of the
strongest and best candidates his
party can put forth. M r. Ritten
house has been one of the leading
merchants of Williams for the past
nine or ten years. He is a thor
ough up to-date business man in
every respect. Honest, capable,
popular, he possesses in marked
degree all the essentials required
to make one of the beet supervisors
Coconino county ever . had. Two
years ago he was elected city clerk
of Williams by one of the largest
majorities ever given a candidate
for a city office. ShouJd he con
sent to make the race for super-
i visor, someone will have to get ,up
and hustle to keep him from being
chairman of the board, for, since
he lived iu Flagstaff prior 10 locat
ing here, he is almost as well and
favorably known there as he is in
Willhms.
Two New Demonstrating Cars
Mr. B. F. Sweetwood has two
new demonstrating cars, a Kissel
Kar and a Maxwell, la addition
to the agency for these two cars,
Mr. Sweetwood has the agency for
the Federal truck. The Maxwell
which he has for demonstrating
purpose is the car that made the
remarkable record hist Sundiy,
of climbing As?h Fork nill on inter
mediate. . Mr. tew ietwood expects
to erect a large garage soon, fuller
details of which will be announced
at another time.
