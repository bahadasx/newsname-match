Mother's Day.
Mother's Day will again be
hold this year by the Modern
Woodmen and Royal Neighbors
under the tent at the' Baptist
church. Mother's Day is always
held on the second Sunday in
May and this year it falls on May
I 1th. This beautiful thought of
setting aside one day of the year
to be particularly dedicated to
mother was first suggested by
M iss Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia,
who founded the Mother's Day
1 inernational Association to pro
vide the necessary organized
support for the fostering of the
movement.
The Modern Woodmen of this
city have ordered great quan
t ities of white carnations to be
worn by the Modern Woodmen
and Royal Neighbors and the
.Mothers on this occasion.
It is hoped that this occasion
will bo the best vet. and everv i
one is cordially invited to come
out and take part in the services.

URGES CLEAN-UP DAY.
A clean up day is urged in
every town in Missouri by Walter
K. Chorn, State Superintendent
of Insurance, in a letter ad
dressed to every newspaper in
the state. This is asked for by
Mr. Chorn for several reasons,
but the main one is to try and
secure a reduction in fire-insurance
rates.
Mr. Chorn urges that all base
ments be thoroughly cleaned and
that rubbish taken out be burned,
but in doing this he particularly
admonishes all to be very careful.

It Does Make a Difference
Where You Buy Your Drugs
There is no other line of business which demands
the same spiiit of carefulness as the sale of drugs.
This carefulness not only refers to an effort to avoid
errors, but it includes care in buying, handling and
selling of everything a druggist carries.
The mission of the drug business is to safeguard the
interests of the public. To do this properly, constant
care must be exerted.
We are careful, and we seek the trade of customers
who appreciate the fact that care counts.
We want you to realize that the characteristic feature
of our store is reliability.

Marshall Field Was Rigixt
Marshall Field founded his success as a retail dealer
on twelve truths. One he called "The obligation of
duty."
This store agrees with Fields. We realize our ob
ligation to the man who trusts our judgment tor the
value he can't see.
It is that deeper value which we offer you in (.loth
craft Clothes tor men and young men---that long-wearing
fabric and thorough-going workmanship, built in
piece by piece and step by step.
The makers of Clothcraft also believe in the obliga
tion of dut. . For seventy years they have labored to
improve medium-priced clothes by putting into added
value the savings due to better methods of manufacture.
Clothcraft sales justify our conviction that the
dealer's success goes hand in hand with the buyer's
satisfaction.
Make our store a visit while in Caruthersville. Will be glad to meet
you. Plenty of ice water, and a rest room for ladies.
