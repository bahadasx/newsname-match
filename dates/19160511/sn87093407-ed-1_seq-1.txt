VOLUME 19
WILSON, ROOSEVELT OR HUGHES?
w ILL it be Wilson and Roosevelt for the nominations? Or Hughes and Wilson?
Or Somebody else and Wilson?
Will Wilson be re-elected? Or will Roosevelt, or Hughes, or some one else beat
him? Perhaps we won't know for some time. But we WILL know how Seattle feels
about it. The Star has arranged for a city-wide ballot on the presidency next Saturday.
It is expected that several thousand votes will be cast. That ought to be a pretty fair
indication of what the voters in King county would like.
In order to make the ballot as representative as possible, and to prevent duplication,
the names of voters will be asked. These names will not be used by The Star nor by any
one else. They will be destroyed as soon as the votes arc counted.
Remember the day! Presidential Preference Election Saturday!
Ballot boxes will be placed by The Star at the following places:
Bon Marche, I raser-Paterson's, New York barber shop, White Building barber shop,
Sanitary market, Westlakc market, Pike Place market. Shafer Bros., Hatton & Oliver,

In this matter-of-fact twenti
