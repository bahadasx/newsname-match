clone. You could tell that , it
meant business. We spent several

shape. Mrs. Tuler has the -finest
chicken-ranch that we have seen
in the county. She has over 500
young chickens and they are fine.

Green. -He lives up at the foot
of the mountains. He has a rock

fight down on the creek a few
days ago. One of the. party got
badly excited over the fight but
nobody was hurt and the dogs
pulled out for home.
