The Secretary of States has been
busily engaged for the past week
counting the names on the petitions.
Xo effort was made however to verify
any of the signatures. A number of
requests were also received to have
names removed from the petitions.
Permanent Injunction.
The injunction drawn up by attor­
neys representing the Bismarck Citi­
zen's league, restrains the Secretary
of State from putting- the removal
amendment on the ballot, and In fact
ties his hands in every possible man­
ner so that nothing further can be
done with the petitions.
.Irregularities Reported.
Reports have come into tlie Capital
City from a number of towns where
New Rockford petitions were circulat­
ed, to the effect that all is ot just
quite right with the petitions. One
man who claims to have seen the pe­
titions" from several counties claims
that any number of names have been
foreed on the petitions, and that as
many as a dozen one on sheet are all
in the same hand writing.
Other signatures he stated were put
down with no address, so that there
is absolutely no way to verify tjiyii.
In several counties he staled, a dofcen
Won
have the required SB per cent of the
voters, counting- just the registered
voters in (,he county.
A few surprises will doubtless be
uncovered, in regard to the petitions
and the manner in which names were
secured, when they come before the
courts.

Washington. The.. dismissed
men, John -iW. Carlson, Alfred Chris­
tiansen, Carl Thomasson El. Herman
sen and William Mathe'son, who are
constituents of Johnson, appealed to
him by telegraph from LaConner,
Wash.
"We the undersigned, members of
the crew of the United States navy
mine planter, Ringgold," the telegram
read, "have been notified that we will
be discharged because we are not
American born. Being naturalized cit­
izens of the state of Washington, we
think this gross discrimination
against foreign iborn citizens, and we
therefore ask you to do us a favor
and look into this matter for us."
Captain Had Orders.
Representative Johnson obtained a
copy of a communication from the
war department directing the captain
of the Ringgold to dismiss all except
native born citizens from his crew.
Secretary Baker said he would inves­
tigate the case and ascertain the cir­
cumstances.
Army officers explained that, as
mine layers necessarily learned the
most carefully guarded of all coast
defense secrets, consequently it was
necessary 'to select the civilian skill­
ed workmen with the utmost care.'

Progressives

'New York, May l©.—'The Progres­
sive Party will not insist upon the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for
President of the United States if the
Republicans will name a candidate
at Chicago, "who stands for progres­
sive principles and is able to put
them through," according to a state­
ment made here tonight by George
W. Perkins, after a meeting of tho
executive committee of the Progres­
sive National Committee.
"We, of course, are for Col. Roose­
velt," declared Mr. Perkins, "and
shall suggest his name to the Repub­
licans." If they reply they will not
agree on the Colonel we shall ask
them to name as their man one who

and expresses regrets for tlie inci
dent and announces that the submit'
rine commander has been "appropri­
ately punished," and declares readi
ness to pay adequate indemnity to
Americans injured on the vessel.
It was indicated at the state depart­
ment that the German statement that
the commander had been punished
would be accepted and the Sussex
case be considered closed except for
the payment of the indemnity for the
citizens of the United States hurt.
There will probably be no negotia­
tions for these indemnity or for final
settlement of other cases pending,
however, until sufficient time ha
elapsed to indicate how the last Am­
erican note was received in Berlin
and whether the new submarin policy
is 'being lived up to.
Was Too Hasty.
Results based on an investigation
of facts supplied the United States
government, the German communica­
tion says has shown that the conten­
tion originally set up by the Germans
that the explosion of the .Sussex was
to ibe traiced to a cause other than a
German submarine attack cannot be
maintained. While asserting that the
submarine commander thought he
was dealing with an enemy warship,
Minister von Jagow admits he form­
ed his judgment too hurriedly and,
therefore, did not act fully in ac­
cordance with the strict instructions
which called upon hini to exercise
particular care.
Will Fulfill Promises.
Officials of the stat3 department
noted particularly the passage of the
note which said: "In view of these
circumstances, the German govern­
ment frankly admits that the assur­
ance given the American government
that passenger vessels were not to
attacked without warning has net
been adhered to in the present case."
This was regarded as indicating a
purpose on Germany's part to decline
to pay indemnity for Americans kill­
ed or injured in attacks on ships oth­
er than passenger liners, prior to the
date of the last note, in which ibe
German government promised th.it
freight, as well as passenger vessels,
would not be attacked without warn­
ing or without provision for the safe­
ty fpersons aboard. Any response
to the note received toiay probably
will make a distinct reservation of
American rights on thh point.

Many Sensation? Develop in Ire
land Resignation Is
Accepted,
WILL INVESTIGATE THE
OUTBREAK IN IRELAND
Government Admits Three Jour­
nalists Were Executed at
Dublin.
London, Eng., May 10.—Ireland pro­
vided a number of sensations today.
The first was the announcement of
the resignation of Baron Wimborne,
Lord Lieutenant, which undoubtedly
has been in Premier Asquith's hands
lor some time, acceptance being de­
layed until normal conditions are re­
stored in Ireland.
The second was the appointment of
a commission headed by Lord Hard­
ing to investigate the causes of the
Irish outbreak. A third was the ad­
mission by the government of the
truth of the report that F. Sheehy
Skeft'ington, editor ot the Irish Citi­
zen and two other journalists had
been executed in the Portobello bar­
racks in Dublin, without the knowl­
edge of the military authorities and
before martial law was actually in
operation.
"A fourth was the granting of the
Dillon's demands for a special ses­
sion of the House of Commons to dis­
cuss the executions in Ireland, and
finally the is?ue of an important mani­
festo to the Irish people by John
Redman, strongly denouncing the re­
bellion movement and eloquently ap­
pealing to Ireland to stand fast by
constitutional means to secure self
government.
TRIALS HAVE CEASED
01' these important events, by far
the most .sensational was the revela­
tion concerning Skeflington, which
formed the vast growing resentment,
of the Irish people at the continuance
of the executions in Dublin, which
already lias given the government
pansi:. and .lLiltved\ I'rumia",AsaulOi
to give an understanding that, there
'will be no more execution pending the
promised Parliamentary discussion,
although two rebels are still await­
ing execution. Thus far the court
martials have dealt with 79 prisoners
of whom 12 have already been execut­
ed Five of tlm seven signatories of
the proclamation of the Irish Repub­
lic?. have jiaid the penalties. Twenty
one were sentenced to ten years, and
forty-two to leaser terms.
Premier Asquith r.itueunced in the
House today that trials in court mar
Ir.t's had ceased.
Issue Manifesto.
The Irish Parliamentary Party has
issued a manifesto to the people of
Ireland for them to support the con­
stitutional movement, for their self
government.
"Another tragedy," says the mani­
festo, "has been added to the long
tale of tragedies of Irish history. The
capital of Ireland has been the scene
of a mad and unsuccessful attempt at
a revolution. Blood has been shed
freely. It- is true that Ireland has
been bitterly provoked by the growth
of a similar revolutionary and illegal
movement in Ireland, backed by a re­
volt. It is true that the grave re­
sponsibility for these events in Dublin
rest- upon the leaders of that move­
ment. These things will have to be
discussed at the proper time.
Shocked At Executions.
"It is true that Ireland has been
shocked and horrified by a series of
military executions by the military
tribunals in Dublin. These things
have been done in the face of inces­
sant and vehement protests of the
Irish leaders hnd these protests will
be pressed continually and strongly
until the unchecked control of the
military authorities in Ireland is
abolished. But it is also true that in
spite of bitter provocation the people
of Ireland have had no hesitation in
condemning the uprising in Dublin as
a dangerous blow at the heart and
hope of Ireland.
"On the morrow of this tragedy, we
feel called upon to make a solemn ap­
peal to the people of Ireland, to draw
the conclusions which these events
forced upon them. We must leave
no misunderstanding in their minds
as to our conditions ,or our resolve.
Either Ireland is to be given over to
an unsuccessful revolution and an­
archy, or the constitutional amend­
ment has the full support of the irish
people, and goes on until it has com­
pleted its work:"

Washington, D. C., May 10.—Furth­

outcome of the El Paso conference of
Generals Scott, Funston and Obregon.
Officials of both the War and State
Department appeared confident that
an agreement satisfactory to both
sides would be negotiated, although
they hesitated to predict how much
more time might be required.
Elisio Arredondo, Mexican Ambas­
sador-designate, called on Counsellor

said the visit bed no significance and

There was nothing to indicate that
the President was inclined to change
his decision that General Pershing's
forces will remain in Mexico, until
the de facto government has demon­
strated 'beyond question its ability
to control the situation there.

of the crime of killing his father, Joe
Shiflet. a wealthy farmer living east
of Carrington, N. D„ and of burning

Father Missing Three Weeks
Three weeks ago, Joe Shiflet dis­
appeared from his farm near Carring­
ton. \eiglibors and relatives insti­
tuted a search in connection with the
sheriff department of Foster and ad­
jacent counties. Recently human
bones were found in a burned straw
pile near his farm. It was supposed
that they were the charred remains
of the father, who was murdered and
the straw pile fired to hide the crime.
Hears of Son's Whereabouts
During this space of time efforts
were made to locate the son. It was
early yesterday morning that word
was communicated to Sheriff A. E.
Morgan of Fos.er county, that a man
answering the description of Anfield
Shiflet was at Selz. In an automobile,
Sheriff Morgan left for the little town.
With an armed posse of several
deputies and citizens they surrounded
young Shiflet who immediately turned
an automatic gun on himself and
fired. He was rushed to a hospital
at Harvey, and died several hours
later.
According to word reaching here,
Shiflet gave out no statement con­
cerning the crime. If he committed
