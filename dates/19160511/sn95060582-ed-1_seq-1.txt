The Galahad of
Arizona:
Governor Hunt
I$v Peter Clark MacFarlane
(From Collier's Weekly)
Apropos o f that experince,
Governor Hunt delivered himself
tome of this aphorism: "You
can't tell how a man is going to
vote. Some of 'em don't say
any thing, but they are able to
lc now right and wrong.
Thmx nro nhlp fn ktinw ricrht.
and wromr. That has been
Hunt's theory all along. He has :
faith in the quiet vote. H e
legislated for the quiet vote. He
governs for the quiet vote, He
campaigns for the quiet vote.
And he gets it' But let us study
his pregubernatorial career for a
few minutes longer.
By tne time Hunt entered the
upper house two other great
corporations had grown up to
power in the State: the United
Verde Copper Company in the
north (a Clark interest) and the
Corper Queen Mining Company
in the south (a Phelps-Dodge in
terest), and Hunt found the four
United Vere'e, Copper Queen,
Sante Fe, and Southern Pacific
leaninsr together to block the
nroeress of anv lesrislation that
affected any one of the four, garding the recall of judges, after
Sometimes when he appeared to j which he went back to Arizona
achieve his obiect as. for in-iandsaW that among- .thrf very i
stance, when after much labor I
he got a railroad commission
created he was discouraged to
find that the thing itself fell
under the control of the railroads
and was used as an instrument of
oppression instead of relief; so
that, after ten years in the Coun
cil, Hunt felt as he had after four
years in the lower house, and
that, taking the whole fourteen
years together, the result was
not worth putting on the adding
machine. Not even the passage
of an act authorizing Arizona and
New Mexico to prepare for ad
mission into the Union was suffi.
cent to cheer him. Hunt was
done with politics. He couldn't
.get anywhere. He started a trip
abroad to calm his fevered spirit
in the longer perspective of
European history. But Arizona
went right on laying plans for
a Constitutional Convention, and
that presistent Globe constituency
coolly nominated the absent
Hunt for a seat in that convention
and as coolly elected him. Hunt
turned back in New York City,
almost from the ship's side. The
convention itself went a. step
further and made Hunt i t s
presiding officer.
With the Constitutional Com
vention up and going around him
and the gavel in his own hand,
Hunt began to cheer up. His
pessinism departed. . , His pror
gressive enthusiasm kindled
enormously. He sawa chance to
' pack this new Constitution full
of that long list of progressive
ideals for which he had been
! standing and to incorporate those
. new instruments of government
which his experience as legislator
had taught him were necessary
if the people were to rule instead
of corporations.
The result was one of the most
forward-looking document of the
time -a documents which im-
mediately brought down upon it
a hammer-and-tongs attack from
every standpat element in the
State. A long muster of promi
nent Democrats put forth a round
robin declaring that the proposed
Constitution was not aDemo
ratic document. President Taft
from Washingtonproclaimed that
it was not a Republican one
Everybody was shooting at it.
So here was the retiring Hunt
with another fight on his hands,
and this time he was nothing !
loath. The final verdict lay with
the voters. They had made him I
make it; now he would make them
take xt-
He hitched a span of
mules to a buckmoard and went
on the stump to tell the people of
Arizona what the Constitution
was and why so many folks did
not like it. This was near the
beginning of Hunts career as a
maker of speeches.. I would not
prophesy that he would get a place
in the Hall of Fame for his oratory
but the voters seemed to approve
his arguments, for they adopted
the constitution by a vote of 3 to 1.
The next job was to get it ap
proved in Washington. That was
harder, for there were things in
it that President Taft did not like.
Hunt made three trips to Wash
ington in its behalf and finally
consented to' the elimination of
'the objectionable provision re-!
early acts of the new State was
an amendments to its Constitution
putting the recall of judges j
straight back into the documents j
which goes to show that Hunt
is persistent in some things. So
the Territory became a State with
a new constitution as its funda
mental law. But the new State
had to have a new governor to
work the new constitution.
Somehow this unpopular and
pestiferous person from Globe
managed to get the Democratic
nomination. Thereafter he got
the election.
Now, the great trouble with
Hunt as a legislator and a con
stitution maker was that he had
impractical notions. He had a
flock of sympathies in his breast
and a congeries of stubborn ideas
under his hat that nobody could
work but himself. As a governor
he took this whole herd of im
practical ideas into office with
him. He remained insular and
aloof, a sympathetic idealist
dealing in abstractions.
IMPOSSIBLY INCORRUPT!
Well, since Hunt was going to
be governor any way some 0f the
corporations made up their mind'
that it was as well to be friendly
and one of them even sent an
ambassador down to call upon the
executive and offer the joyous
hand of cooperation.
"What can we do, governor,
to help make your administration
a success?" beamed the visitor.
"You might begin by paying
your share of the taxes." sug
gested the governor dryly, and
also shyly, for he was still a timid
soul.
That, it seemed, was the whole
extent of the governor's idea
of cooperation from this concern.
As the concern was one of the
most notorious tax dodgers in the
State, it was really puite a big
idea, but it wasn't at all what
the corporation representative
had hoped for. He departed
sadly.
Which shows how impossible a
governor George Wylie Paul Hunt
is. Once he gets an idea it ap
pears to obsess him. He had the
notion that for twenty years the
big corporations had been getting
too much representation with too
little taxation. One of his early
duties was to appoint a tax com
mission. Here was a chance to
even up things. .The governor
embraced it. He never even con
sulted the principal taxpayers in
the the State that Corporation
Big Four. He just went ahead
and named any set of persons
that came into his head.
That a commission so named
could have no adequate sense of
its duty was soon apparent, for
what did it do but'go to work and
raise the assessmentroll $255,C00
000 millions, mind you and
almost the whole of these extra
hundreds of millions it tacked
right on the back of the Big Four!
Was there ever such a impracti
cal governor or Tax t'om mission?
The State Government was very
extravagant, too.
It costs ever
so much more to run a State than j temperance and " purity. As a
a Territory, and there was a great j badge they used the five pointed
hue and cry over Hunt's extra- star which ihey ltgftded as a
vagance, yet when the common ' symbol of health. A red five point
folk got their tax bills they ed star appears on each package

This was just the Sir Galahad
in the governor breaking out.
He is a humorist and an idealist.
He has not got such a lot of
concern for things as they are.
He cares more about things as
they ought to be and that is
what all the row is about.
But whatever the governor's
success or lack of success with
administration problems, it must
be conceded that he has had
trouble with the Legislature.
It is true that the governor and
the Legislature agreed over some
things. A blue-sky law was
passed, at least a partial super
vision over public utilities was
established, and measures were
1 n euro foivov prmrH-
tions for men and women whohanin ?re for sm
must cope- with great combina
tions of basinass powar.
But the first session rebelled
openly at making several of the
constitutional provisions effective
by legislative enactment, The
third did worse. It to ok a hack
at the executive prestige in a
bill that limited his pardoning
power, The governor vetoed the
bill, and the Legislature promptly
rolled up the necessary two-thirds
to repass it over his veto, which
was a legislative way of rudely
jamming the executive hat down
over eyes and ears. -
The executive " hacked right
back . again by invoking the
referendum, which held up the
antipardoning bill for two years,
or until the election of November
1914.
This brings us directly to the
governor's prison policy- the
policy responsible for, the most
dangerous tempests that rattle
and crash about Sir Galahad's
ears.
! The governor is better known
throughout the country for his
i experiments as an amateur
penologist than for any thing else.
In this field, as in many others,
he has been influenced in his line
of action by the books he has
read' His sympathetic interest
in the prisoner as a human being
dates from the first time he read
the tragic story of the prison life
of Jean Valjean as depicted in
Victor Hugo's great novel "Les
Miserables." But even here the
first turn of Hunt's genius was
practical.

RELIEF FUND
Senator Isaac Barth was in the
city for a few days last week and
left for his home at Albuquerque
N. M. Monday. Mr. Barth came
here for the purpose of trying to
make some adjustment in the
matter of the relief fund which
had been set aside by the State
for the relief of the flood
sufferers. The matter has been
time on
account of several hanging out
for more than they actually lost
etc. Mr. Barth tells us that the
matter has now been adjusted
and no doubt the mon ey which is
badly needed by the people of
the county, will soon be forth
coming. Let us hope so.
Mr. Barth deserves a good deal
of credit for the way in which he
has brought about this settle
ment. Apostle George F. Richards,

were very timely and should, and
will no doubt, be of great benefit
to the people of the St. Johns
