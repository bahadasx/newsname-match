Mr. James W. Gerard, the following
reply to' the note of April 20, regard- 1

that those restrictions are necessarily

No such consideration has ever been
shown neutrals by Great Britain and
her Allies."
Submarine Orders.
"The German submarine forces
have had. in fact, orders to conduct
the submarine warfare in accordance
with the general principles of visit and
search and the destruction of men

tional law, the sole exception being
the conduct of warfare against enemy j
trade carried on enemy freight ships j
encountered in the war zone surround- j
ing Great Britain. With regard to
these no assurance has ever been given
to the Government of the United
States. No such assurances are contained
in the declaration of February
8. 1916."
Claim Errors Occurred.
"The German Government cannot
admit any doubt that these orders
were given or are executed in good
faith. Errors actually occurred. They j
can in no kind of warfare be avoided
altogether. Allowances must be made |
in the conduct of naval warfare I
against an enemy resorting to all j

'Unavoidable" Dangers to Neutrals.
"But apart from the possibility of

sera for neutral persons and Roods j
sntering the fighting zone. Even in
mses where the nr.val action Is con- J
Ined to ordinary forms of cruiser war- j
fare neutral persons and Roods repeatedly
come to grief.
"The German Government has re- I
peatedly pointed out the dangers from
mines that have led to the loss of
numerous ships.
Some German Pepper in This.
"The German Government has made i
several proposals to the Government I
:>f the United States in order to re-1
luce to a minimum for American travelers
and goods the inherent dangers j
if naval warfare. Unfortunately the
3overnment of the United States decided
not to accept the proposals. Had
It accepted the Government of the
United States would have been instrumental
in preventing the greater part
if the accidents that American citizens
have met with in the meantime.
"The Gernian Government still
stands by Its offer to come to an
agreement along these lines."
Makes Further Concession.
"As the German Government repeatedly
declared, it cannot dispense
wit?, the use of the submarine weaoon
In the conduct of warfare against
enemy trade. The German Government.
however, has now decided to
make a further concession, adapting
methods of submarine war to the in
Ki.inin fii lOUirHIH.
"In reaching this derision the German
Government is actuated by con
siderations which are above the leve'
of disputed question."
Sacred Principles of Humanity.
"The German Government attaches
no less importance to the sacred
principles of humanly than the Gov- '
eminent of the United States. It
\gain fully takes into account that
both governments for many years cooperated
in developing international
law in conformity with these priori j
pies, the ultimate object of which has
ilways been to confine warfare on sea
end land to armed forces of bellieer
nts and safeguard aa far as possible
noii'combat ants against the horrors
if war. Rut although these considerations
are of great weight, they
ilone would uot under present cir
umstances have determined the ptti
ude of the German Government.

ARE, EYES ON
Puts Blame on England.
"For in answer to the appeal by
the Government of the United States
on Knh nl/ ?? ? * * *
ui me wi-reu principles OI
humanity and International law the
German Government must repea once
more with all emphasis, that it was
not the German, but the British Government
which ignored all accepted
rules of international law and ex
tended this terrible war to the lives
and property of non-combatants, having
no regard whatever for the inter
ests and rights of neutrals and non
combatants that through this method
of warfare have been severely injured
Had to Resort to Submarines.
"In self-defense against the illegal
conduct of British warfare, while
fighting a bitter struggle for National
existence. Germany had to resort to
the hard but effective weapon of submarine
warfare.
Touches Upon England's Attempt to
Starve Germany.
"As matters stand the German Government
cannot but reiterate regret
that the sentiment of humanity which
the Government of the United States
extends with such fervor to the unhappy
victims of submarine warfare
are not extended ^ith the same
warmth of feeling to many millions of
women and children who, according
to the avowed intention of the
British Government, shall be starved
ana wno, by sufferings, shall force the
victorious armies of the Central Powers
into Ignominious capitulation.
Refers Often to Great Britain.
"The German Government, in agreement
with the German people, fails
to understand this discrimination, all
the more as it has repeatedly and explicitly
declared itself ready to use
the submarine weapon in strict con
formity with the_rules of international
law as recognized before th" outbreak
of the war, if Great Britain likewise
was ready to adapt the conduct of
warfare to these rules.
"Several attempts made by the Government
of the United States to prevail
upon the British Government to
act accordingly failed because of flat
refusal on the part of the British
Government. Moreover Great Britain
again and again has violated interna-1
tiona^ law. 'surpassing all bounds in
outraging neutral rights. The latest
measure, adopted by Breat Britain
declaring German bunker coal contraband
and establishing conditions un
der which English bunker coal alone
is supplied to neutrals is nothing but
an unheard-of attempt by way of
exaction to force neutral tonnage into
the service of British trade war."
Again Criticises United States.
"The German people know that the
Government of the United States has 1
the power to confine the war to armed
forces of the belligerent countries, in
the interest of humanity and maintenance
of international law. The Government
of the United States would
have been certain of attaining this
end had it been determined to insist I
against Great Britain on the incontrovertible
rights to freed om of the
seas. But as matters stand the German
people are under the impression ;
that the Government of the United !
States, while demanding that Germany.
struggling for existence, shall !
restrain the use of an effective weapon j
and while making compliance with i
these demands a condition for maintenance
of relations with Germany
confines itself to protosts against il
legal methods adopted by Germany's
enemies. Moreover, the German people
know to what considerable extent
its enemies are supplied with all
kinds of war material from the United
States."

"It will, therefore, be understood

circumstances meet the some hearty
response from the German people
which such an appeal otherwise always

concessions, It has been guided not
alone by the friendship collecting
the two great nations for over one
hundred years but also by the thought
of the great doom which threatens
the entire civilized world should this
cruel and sanguinary war he extended
and prolonged."
Twice Tried to Bring About Peace.
"The German Government conscious
of Germany's strength twice within
the last few months announced before
the world its readiness to make peace
on a basis safeguarding Germany's
vital interests, thua indicating that It
is not Germany's fault if peace is stil'
withheld from the Nations of Europe.
The German Government feels all the
more justified in declaring that responsibility
could not be borne before
the forum of mankind and in history
if after 21 months of the war's duration
the submarine question under dis
cussion between the German Govern
ment and the Government of the
United States were to take a turn so
riously threatening maintenance of
peace between the two nations.
Will Not Attack Neutral Ships.
"As far as lies with the German
Government, It wishes to prevent
things from taking such a course. The
German Government. moreover, is
prepared to do its utmost to confine
operations of the war for the rest of
its duration to the fighting forces ot
the belligerents, thereby also insuring
freedom of the seas, a principle upon
which the German Government believes,
now as before, that it is in
agreement with the Government of the
United States.

such vessels, both within and without
the area declared a naval war zone,
shall not be sunk without warning
and without saving human lives unless
the ship attempt to escape or
offer resistance.'
Introduces Restrictions.
'But for neutrals cannot expect
that Germany, forced to fight for existence.

is convinced that the Government
of the United States does not
think of making such a demand, knowing
that the Government of the United
States repeatedly declares that it
is determined to restore the principle
of freedom of the seas, from whatever
quarter it has been violated."
"Accordingly the German Government
is confident that in consequence
of the new orders issued to the naval
forces the Government of the United
States will also now consider all impediments
removed which may have
been in the way of mutual co-operation
toward restoration of the freedom of
the seas during the was. as suggested
in the note of July 23 1*15. and it does
not doubt that the Government of the
United States will now demand and insist
that the British government shall

the war ns are laid down in the notes
presented by the Government of the
United States to the British Government

"Should stops taken ny the Government
of the United States not attain
the object it desires to have the laws

would then be facing a new situation

th Cymric occurred ofT the west coast "
; of Ireland.
The fate of the steamship is not yet

The Cymric left New York April s

Text of American Reply.
Following is the text of the note
a bled by Secretary Lansing to Amassador
Gerard to Berlin with instruclons
to deliver It to the German minster
of foreign affairs:
"The note of th< Imperial Gorman
overnment under date of May 4. 191f>,
as received careful consideration by
ne government 01 mt1 unui'o states,
t Is especially noted as indicating the
urposo of the Imperial Government

"Throughout the months which

:ion. In order, however, to avoid any
possible misunderstanding the government
of the United States notifies the
Imperial Government that it can not
Tor a moment entertain, much less dis uss.
a suggestion that respect by German
naval authorities for the rights
>f citizens of the United States upon
the high seas should In any way or in
the slightest degree be made contingent
upon the conduct of any other
government affecting the rights of
neutrals and non-combatants. Responsibility
in such matters is single, not
loint; absolute, not relative."
Secretary Lansing's Statement.
Mr. Lansing's statement made public
after the note was on its way to
Berlin, follows:
"The greater part of the German
answer is devoted to maters which
this government can not discuss with
the German Government. The oniv
questions of right which can be discussed
with that government are those
arising out of its action or out of our
own. and in no event those questions
which are the subject of diplomatic
exchanges between the United States
and any other country.
Essence of Her Answer.
"The essence of the answer is that
Germany yields to our representations
with regard to the rights of merchant
ships ami non-combatants on the high
sens ami engages to observe the recognized
rules of international rules
governing naval warfare in using her
submarines against merchant ships.
Losses Will Have to be Settled. , ?
"So long as she lives up to this1
altered policy we can have no reason
to quarrel with her on that score,
though the losses resulting from the
violation of American rights by German
submarine commanders operating
under the former policy will have
to he settled.
Germany Declined a Treaty.
"While our differences with Great
Hrit:iin run lint form n Miiliinpf t\f ftiu.
cussion with Germany it should be
stated that in our dealings with the
British Government we are acting as
we are unquestionably bound to act
in view of the explicit treaty engage
ments with that government. We
have treaty obligations as to the manner
in which matters in dispute between
the two governments are to
be handled. We offered to assume
mutually similar obligations with Germany.
but the offer was declined.
When, however, the subject in dispute
is a continuing menace to American
lives it is doubtful whether such obligations
apply unless the menace is
removed during the pendency of the
proceedings."
Treaty of Arbitration.
The treaty with the British Government
referred to is the convention
negotiated by former Secretary Bryan
under which the two nations agree
that any dispute arising shall be submitted
to an investigating commission
for one year before entering into hostilities.
An offer to enter into such a treaty
for Germany brought a request for information
but formal negotiations
never were instituted.
The hope that the note might end
the discussion regarding the conduct
of submarine warfare was entertained
by some officials and by persons in

way would l>e cleared for renewal of
negotiationa for settlement of tin

rases growing out of illegul submarine
attacks. In other official quarters,
however, there apparently was uncer
talnty regarding the result which the
note might have. A new crisis, it was
pointed out. would arise, should Germany
make a rejoinder to the communication
and insist that its new policy
