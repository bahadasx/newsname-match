Wool Car's hong Tour.
Washington, D. 0 The wool car
pf the U. S. Department of Agriculture
which left Livingston,' Montana, on
January 19th, has giVen demostrationa
in more than 50 towns of the Impor
tant sheep-growing states to at least 6,
000 persons directly interested in wool
? growing. Since leaving Livingston, the
car has been touring Montana, Idaho,
Wyoming and Utah In -order to de
monstrate to sheep men that the pro
duction of better wool mea.us more
money for them. ' The tour is the re
sult of oooperate arrangements made
between the Bureau of Animal Indus
try of the Department of Agriculture
and the 'agricultural' oolleges of the
four States named. . ;
' The trip of this ear Is regarded by
wool specialists as the most impor
tant educational effort that has yet
been made in aid of the sheep Indus
try, which provides 9 Btates, embrac
ing one-third of the total area of the
country, with the greater part of their
income. In recent years a wide ln
interest has been aroused In the bet
ter preparation of wools for market.
At the same time,' however, there has
been in some quarters a certain doubt
- whether the financial returns would
repay the attention and expense In
volved in a departure from the pres
ent methods, or rather the present
lack of methods. The more progres
sive sheep men have realised that the
success of the movement is dependent
upon general co-operation among the
wool growers. This can hardly be ex
1 pected In the absence of familiarity
with the market grades of wools and
a knowledge of the wide differences
in values possible in wools of the
same grade. It is to furnish this in
formation to practical sheep men that

the demonstration car is now making
its tour. . . '-.!...
In'the car are live sheep with 'fleeces
representing the main market grades
grown in the section In which the oar
is traveling. Above the'prates hold
ing the sheep are cases containing
similar fleeces, the grade, shrinkage
and value of which are clearly indi
cated. Stationary magnifying glasses
show the distinctions in the fineness
of the various grades of small samples.
Considerable space is also devoted to
exhibits demonstrating the way in
which the value of wool depends upon
its natural shrinkage, strength and
character. The methods of branding,
packing and tying are also shown.
Another "portion of the exhibit
which has roused much interest con
sists pf cases containing samples of
wool in various stages of manu
facture from the wool in the fleece to
the finished fabric, ' Very few sheep
men understand the many processes
Involved in the manufacture of fin
ished articles from the fleece and are
not, Iherefore, in a position to appre
ciate tlje Importance which manu
facturers attach to the different char
acteristics of the wool that they pur
chase. t
The exhibits In the car are explain
ed to visitors by representatives of
the Department of Agriculture and of
the agricultural college cooperating
with the Federal .Department. A
number of colleges In other western
states have asked to have the car visit
their territories, and dates and places
will be arranged for continuing the
demonstration as soon as it1 is known
what funds will be available for the
purpose during the coming fiscal
year;- , . . .- -. . ,

Cold Facts.
For years wage advances have come
to railroad employes in road service
rather easily They have become c
customed to getting what they want
without a test of strength. ' For that
reason there is little doubt that they
will vote now to have their leaders go
through with the programme. The
vote being taken is not a constitution
al strike vote. That is explicitly set
forth in the ballot. But the leaders
can get a favorable strike vote to
strengthen their hands when they need
it. This movement is from the bot
tom, not from the top. It is not the
brotherhood chiefs who are forcing,
the issue, but the rank and file, a fact
which the railroad managers must
recognize,
Union politics may be a factor in
the situation, but not the determining
one. It is significant that if the pro
gramme is carried out, negotiations
will be under way In May. Conven
tions of the brotherhoods of firemen,
conductors and trainmen will be held
in May this year. The old adage about
'"swapping horses while crossing a
stream" is applicable. It may be only
a coincidence, because the shorter
workday has been an issue for a long
time. The last conventions of all the
brotherhoods expressed themselves
on the subject. The' Switchmen's
Union, which is not directly involved
in this movement, went on record for
an eight-hour day at its convention
last year, although it proposed to
bring it about by federal legislation.
The brotherhoods fav a more direct
method.

Ironton Testimony Remains
Unshaken. ,
Time is the best test of truth. Here
is an Ironton story that has stood the
test ef time. It is a story with a point
which will come straight to many of
us.
Anderson Rust, painter, Ironton,
says: "I was badly in need of some
thing to relieve me of lameness in my
back. My kidneys were frequently
too active, especially at night, and
sometimes the passages of the kidney
secretions were accompanied by pain.
Short use of Doan's Kidney Pills pro
cured at the Arcadia Valley Drug Co.,
cured me."
Over three years later, Mr.
Rust said: "I haven't had any re
turn of kidney complaint since Doan's
Kidney Pills cured me."

simply ask for a kidney remedy get

Obituary.
The Death Angel has again winged
its way and took from our midst a
kind loving father. John Riley Stev
ens was born in Texas county, Feb
ruary 4, 1856, and died at his home in
Esther, Mo., April 1, 1916. He
was married at an early age to
Miss Sarah Jane Turner, of Craw
ford eounty. . To this union 15 chil
dren were born, 5 of which have
been called to that better land. His
wife died January 7, 1903, leaving him
with quite a family of small children,
which he worked and strived hard to
keep them together, and had the
privilege of living to see them all the
age they can look out for themselves.
Mr. Stevens was sick only a short
time with pneumonia, till the
master bade him come to the home
which he has prepared for all that do
his will. While the children miss him
here on earth they can be cousoled by
the thought he is enjoying his
heavenly rest, for he was a life long
Christian, having professed faith in
Christ at an early age and received In
the M. E. Church, to which ho lived
faithful until his death. He leaves
eight sons, two daughters, thirteen
grandchildren and a host of friends
and relatives to mourn his death.
..The funeral was conducted at the
house by the pastor of the M. E.
Church at Esther, April 2d, at 1
o'clcck. His body was laid to rest in
the Russell Chapel Cemetery to wait
the final resurrection day. May the
children all live prepared to meet him
In the skies. - A Relative!.
