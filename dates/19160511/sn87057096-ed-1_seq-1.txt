rick Griflin.
Yesterday was the thirtieth wed
ding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Pat
Griffin, who reside on West Jefferson
street, and quite a party of their
neighbors and friends participated in
a surprise upon them.
The affair was held at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Geo. H. Williams,
on New York avenue, and in addition
to the observance of the anniversary
the neighbors made it an occasion io
welcome Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, who
have but lately become residents of
Creston. They recently moved to this
place from Grand River, Iowa. The
neighbors gathered in and enjoyed
themselves in games and a general
good time was had by everyone pres
ent.
One of the delightful features was
the serving of refreshments by Misses
Thelma Smith and Helen Griffin. Miss
Griffin favored those present with a
few recitations, adding greatly to the
pleasure of all. Mrs. Williams proved
herself a most royal entertainer, and
the hospitality of the Williams home
was greatly appreciated. The guest
list included Mr. and Mrs. Wallace,
who,were also present at the wedding
thirty years ago, Mr. and Mrs. I. B.
Ferguson, Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Dob
bins, Justice and Mrs. Harry Smith,
(we might add that Harry also did
justice to the refreshments), Mr. and
Mrs. M. C. Hatch, Airs. Sullivan, Miss

The preacher looked somewhat
lonely after the shower scared his
congregation away, but he had made
his announcements, had the collec
tion, did not need to pronounce tha
benediction, and is a sermon ahead.
Thursday evening of this week at
8:45 the church will tender a recep
tion to its new members, its friends
and all who handed in their card of
church preference. We all meet in
the basement which is now complet
ed. Extend the invitation most cor
dially. Let all be present.
The sermon next Sunday morning
will be a discussion from a scriptur
al point of view of the subject of
woman suffrage. If God's word has
any light on the subject let us strive
to discern the same.
Sunday evening has been set aside
for our "Mother's Day" sermdh. The
theme will be "Mother." The opening
services will be in charge of our
Baraca Sunday school class. These
young men will lead in prayer, read
the scripture lesson, leai the singing
and will also offer some special fea
tures. Happy are the mothers who
have such worthy sons.
No intervening providence it is our
plan to go to the river at Davis City
next Sunday afternoon to conduct
baptismal services. We are planning
to leave the church at 1 o'clock. We
will go in company with Rev. Henry
Esch of the Christian church, and
those candidates of his who will also
be baptized at that time. It is also
quite probable that we will be accom
panied by Rev. B. Frank Jacobs of
the Presbyterian church with his can
didates who are to be baptized by im
mersion. All that have not yet sig
nified their intentions, let them make
their plans accordingly.
