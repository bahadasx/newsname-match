For more than thirty-five years
Heppner Lodge No. 69, A. F. & A.
M. had Its home irt the wooden struc
ture at the southwest corner of Main
and Willow streets, and with that old
home is associated scores of fond rec
ollections and hundreds of pleasant
associations. It was here that Hepp
ner Lodge grew and prospered, reach
ing the point in Its history that made
it necessary to seek better and more
commodious surroundings. Like the
things of this world, the old home
hud served its day and generation and
was called to give place to the march
of progress and the demands of the
times.
There now stands on this corner
the beautiful brick and stono edi
fice, illustrated in these columns last
week and which was on Saturday eve
ning last, in the presence of more
than two hundred Masons and their
wives, appropriately dedicated to the
Supreme Architect of the Universe
and the service of humanity.
This new structure has heen fully
described heretofore, has been thrown
open to the inspection of the people
of this vicinity and they have pro
nounced it good; splendidly ar
ranged and elegantly furnished and
appointed for the purpose it is to
serve, namely: A home for the Ma
sonic bodies of Heppner. And this
Is hot all. The structure is a beau
tiful ornament to the city and marks
the beginning of a new era of pro
gress In Heppner. Its construction
being modern and up-to-date, it em
bodies the latest ideas In the making
of a lodge home.
The dedication services, arranged
under the supervision of the building
committee, Messrs. T. J. Mahoney,
Oscar Borg and W. E. Pruyn, were
conducted by Deputy .Grand Master
Will Moore, of Pendleton. He was
assisted' by members of Heppner
Lodge No. 69, lone Lodge No. 120
and Condon Lodge, the officers being
as follows:

Architect C. C. ftoubins, of Port

the Grand Master in the ceremonies
of dedication.
The services were simple, yet very
impressive, and to the great majority
of those present was a scene never
before witnessed and much interest
was manifested in the beautiful cere
mony. The dedication was closed by
the Grand Orator, Sam E. Van Vac
tor, In a short address which we shall
not attempt to eulogize as our words
could not do Mr. Van Vactor justice,
but have decided to give a verbaim
report of it that all our readers can
j have the pleasure of reading what
the more fortunato in attendance up
on the ceremonies were privileged to
hear.
The dedication was followed by a
splendid spread in the beautiful din
ing hall. This was prepared and
served by the ladies of Ruth Chapter
No. 32, O. E. S., and when this is
announced about all that is necessary
to say has been said. The tables were
arranged to scat 120, and were filled
once and a half.
Heppner Lodge received its char

years of age. Of its long list of
members, but one Is living now that

i iod. Frank Gilliam was not a char
j ter member of the lodge, but was one
of the very first initiates and has
I been a constant attendant during all
, these years, being a faithful and re
j liable member. Mr. Gilliam no
; doubt recalled many pleasant memor
i ies on this occasion, and he must also
I have reflected on the years that are
passed away and recalled to his mind
a large number of the old members
of the order who have passed to the
beyond, but who, had they been pres
ent at this service, would have made
the pleasure of the event perhaps
greater. We can recall many of the
old guard who would have had great
I pleasure, indeed, in this service and
joined heartily in trie rejoicing of
i the brethern of Heppner Lodge No.
, 69 in the consummation of the hope
that had been entertained for so
many years past.

There were received the Impres

There in manhood's early dawn

assistance to the less fortunate, men
i who confidntly trod the avenues of

FARMERS, BUSINESS
The Heppner Commercial Club at its last meeting unanimously
passed a resolution that will be of great benefit to our business men
and others as well. That any advertising solicitor, promoter, or so
licitor for financial aid of any kind must first obtain the O. K. of
the Executive Committee before their proposiions will he considered
by the Club members.
We ask that each member Insist that the official O. K. be obtained
before considering or committing yourself to any scheme that may
be presented. By all working together on this matter, no worthy
cause or plan will be turned down, but on the other hand, our cit
izens will be materially helped financially and otherwise. Just send
the next onet o Secy W. W. Smead for Information as to how to pro
ceed. Also the citizens are requested to use every effort to promote the
sale of Willow Brand Butter, In preference to other brands. And
to discourage the making and selling of country butter, but to per
suade that it is better for all concerned for the farmers to sell their
cream ot our creomery. HEPPNKIt COMEKCI L CLUB.

that would cause to spring forth a
new resolve, a higher aim.
The dedication of this Hall to vir
tue and universal Benevolence by the
Most Worshipful Grand Master this
erening in the name of the Supreme
and eternal God, the grand architect
of Heaven and earth, is deeply im
pressive and imposes upon each and
every Mason a most solemn and bind
ing duty.
That this ceremony and these ser
vices shall prove no idle mockery, no
empty waste of words, no pagan in
cantation; That we shall not only
practice that virtue here but in the
daily walks of life wherever dispers
ed. That brotherhood may indeed
become universal throughout the
world. That we shall bend our ener
gies and use our best endeavors that
strife, greed and avarice among men
and nations shall cease.
That peace and happiness may
reign on earth and endure forever.
That the brave men who have died
in the cause of humanity, in the
cause of justice, the cause of right;
That he who wore the crown of
thorns on the cross at Calvary shall
not have lived, shall not have suffer
ed, shall no.t have died in vain.
That he who lives in the land of
the frozen North shall enjoy the same
blessings and receive the same reward
as he who dwells in a sunny clime.
That each and every man as he ap
proaches the going down of the sun of
life, as the lights burn dim and low,
may feel like one who has completed
a joyful pilgrimage, who after tra
versing the desert plains with the oc
casional illumination of the oasis,
passed through the darkened valleys,
over storm-swept mountain ranges,
in the beauteous calm of morning's
dawn emerges on the lofty mountain
top and as he looks upon nature's
wonders outspreadbefore him, is
bowed with a hush of gladness, and
reverently proclaims there is a God
and God is good.
And tonight, my brothers, to these
things, we dedicate, we consecrate
this temple.
Not to masonry as contained with
in the narrow confines of these four
walls of brick and stone.
Not to those of us alone who are
asembled here, but to the generations
that are yet to come, to the world, to
God, and humanity.
And may you, through whose devo
tion and sacrifice has been builded
this temple of Justice and fraternity,
say in the langunge of Solomon, son
of David, chosen of God, to rule over
the people of Israel and build unto
the Lord a House of Worship:
"I have surely built thee a house
to dwell in, a settled place for thee to
abide in forever."

GiRCUIT COURT
HASSHORTSESS
Only One Case by Tri:il Jnrj Grand
Jury Makes Report And is Dis- ,
missed Until November Term.
All cases on the docket for the May
term of circuit court were disposed
of in short order, court convening on
Monday morning and adjourning on
Tuesday evening. The greater part
of this time was taken up with the
Ward-McKimmey trial, the only case
coming before a jury. This was a
case wherein D. M. .Ward was sueing
W. S. McKimniey for damages in
curred, Ward alleges, through an in
junction which McKimmey had filed,
prohibiting Ward from selling his
wheat when the price was up. Ward
asked for general and punitive dam
ages. He alleged that McKimmey
had brought the injunction through
malicious purposes. Ward had farm
the McKimmey land on the shares
and the damage suit was the out
growth of their dealings. The Jury
returned a verdict for the plaintiff in
the sum of $750. Ward had asied
for $1500. The jury trying this case
consisted of W. E. Pruyn, foreman;
O. E. Johnson, Guy L. Hadley, O. L.
Forbes, E. P. Jarmon, Jim Knighten,
A. P. Parker, M. H. Bates, Oscar
Keithley, Carl Her, E. O. Neill and
Ralph Beckett. Woodson & Sweek
were attorneys for plaintiff and John
Gavin of The Dalles appeared for the
defendant.
Many other cases which would
have come up at this time were set
tled out of court and dismissed.
The new grand jury consisting of
E. M. Shutt, foreman; C. W. Booher,
Guy Boyer, N. M. Johnson, W. H.
Padberg, H. L. McAlister and Paul
Webb, reported to the court after be
ing out only a short time. They had
nothing to report and were dismissed
from further duty until the Novem
ber term.
Judge Phelps will return to Hepp
ner June 8, when he will pass on nat
uralization cases. Other court mat
terswill b attended to on June 9th.
FISH iD GIE PIC
TURES m HEBE
Pictures of Oregon game life were
shown at the Star theater on Tuesday
evening under the supervision of
state game warden Carl Shoemaker
and under the auspices of the Morrow
County Rod and Gun Club. Mr.
Shoemaker recently put the pictures
on in Pendleton and he was accom
panied to Heppner from that city
by Marion Jack, who is a member of
the state game and fish commission.
These pictures were taken under
the direction of W. L. Finley, state
biologist and many of them were tak
en under great difficulty. Especially
is this true of antelope scenes in
southeastern Oregon. The antelope
is a very cautious and suspicious aui
mal and for that reason it was neces
sary for the picture man to use a mic
roscopic lense. Pictures of the ante
lopes shown by the game commission
is the only herd in the Btate at tha
present time. Mr. Shoemaker stat
ed that antelope were very numerous
in this part of the state at one time,
more so than deer are at the present
time.
Local sportsmen were especially in
terested in the pictures of the state
game farm at Corvalli. It is 'here
that thousands of China pheasants
are raised every year and the dif
ferent methods which are used in
bringing these birds up to the time of
liberation are interesting to see.
The fish industry is given prominence
in these films, showing how the fish
commission is saving thousands of
fish every year in the propagation
of the specie under the proper condi
tions. The salmon fishing scenes at
Oregon City are especially worthy of
mention.
in showing these pictures over tho
state, Mr. Shoemaker is endeavoring
to increase the favor of public senti
ment on the side of our fish and
game. In his lectures and picture
talks he explains the workings
of the commission, its aim and desire
for theutmost co-operation from the
public. He says the organization of
roda nd gun clubs in the counties ov
er the state is helping the commission
very much in building up awide sen
timent for the protection of the fish
urd game. Thoso who missed see
ing these pictures Tuesday evening
overlooked a rare treat. Tne pic
tures were shown free of charge to
the school pupils of Heppner at the
theater on Tuesday afternoon.
