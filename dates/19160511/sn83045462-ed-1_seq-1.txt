Thomas Kent Shot for Part in
Rebellion in County
Cork.
IRISH SITUATION HOLDS
SPOTLIGHT IN ENGLAND
Both Houses of Parliament Engaged.!
Successor to Baron Wimborne
to Be Chosen.
LONDON. May 11.?Irish affairs occupied
today even a more important position
in the public mind than they did at the
time of the home rule controversy. Both
houses of parliament are again engaged
with them today. John Dillon's motion
for discussion of the executions in Ireland
comes up in the house of commons
and the house of lords is considering
Lord Loreburn's motion expressing dissatisfaction
with the Irish administration.
The debate in the house of commons is
regarded as the more important, for there
the government comes under the crossfire
ot the whole Irish party and of a large
number of liberal members who are determined
to bring an end not only to arrests
and executions in Ireland, but to
martial law.
The execution iti County Cork of
Thomas Kent, although it took place before
Premier Asrjuith gave his assurance
that no further death sentences would i

has brought forth further protests
from Irish parliamentary circles.

the continued arrest and deportation to ;
Kngland for confinement in Knglish jails
of rebels from all parts of the country.
The number of arrests has not yet been
made known, but it must be several thousand.
First Execution Outside Dublin.
The execution of Thomas Kent of
Coole took place at Fermoy. Ireland, it
being the first execution outside of Dubtin.
Premier Asquith has informed the j
house that Sir Roger Casement, who was '
captured on attempting to land in Ire- j
land to learl the rebellion, would be placed |
on trial .Monday.
The government has just admitted i
the truth of the report that F. Sheehy
Skefiington. editor of the Irish Citizen, j
and two other journalists had been ex- j
ecuted in the Portobello barracks in i
Dublin without the knowledge of the!
military authorities and before martial '
law was actually in operation. r
A special session of the house of \
commons will be held to d>scuss the ex- i
ecutions in Ireland. John Redmond has
issued a manifesto to the Irish people,
strongly denouncing the rebellious i
movement and eloquently appealing to !
Ireland to stand fast by constitutional j
means to secure self-government.
Probably the most sensational recent j
event is the revelation concerning Skef- i
fington. which formed the climax of the
fast-growing resentment of the Irish
people at the policy of continuation of
executions in Dublin which has already i
Kiven the government cause to pause !
and induced Premier Asquith to give (
assurance that there will be no more j
executions pending the promised parliamentary
discussion, although there I
are two Dublin rebels still awaiting j
execution.
Eighty Prisoners Dealt With.
Thus far the court martials have dealt
with eighty prisoners, of whom thirteen
have already been executed. Five of t
the seven signatories of the proclama- j
tion of the Irish republic have paid the '
last penalty. Four rebels have been
sentenced to 1 if*=? imprisonment, twenty- '
one to ten years and forty-two to lesser
terms.
Premier Asquith has announced that
the trials by < ourt-martial had virtually
finished. He hoped that there would
he no further need to proceed with extreme
rigor.
While there is considerable difference!
of opinion as to whether it is safe to
revoke martial law in Ireland yet, and I
many members of both houses are sat-j
is fled that Maj. Den. Hir John Maxwell's
severity was fully justified, the .Skeffington
incident causes indignation. He j
was shot on April ??>. Martial law camel
into operation on April L'k. The prime |
minister described the shooting as "an
isolated act of an irresponsible individual.
who immediately was placed under
arrest "
Important Resolutions.
The nationalists have adopted a
M-nes of important resolutions, including
a strong expression of opinion that
continued executions would cause bit-.
terness and exasperation anions Irish
people having no sympathy with the
insurrection, and that in the interests
of the empire, as well as Ireland,
martial iaw should he revoked.
An Irish delegation conferred with
Mr As'juith last, evening regarding, the
question of < ompensation for property

BANK EXAMINER'S
RECOMMITTED
Hann's Report on Riggs Institution,
as of May 1, 1913,
to Come Into Court.
POINT OF CONCESSION
nppnspn RY nFFFWRF
Reading of Retails of Equity Proceedings
Occupies Entire Day
in Perjury Trial.
Attempt by the government to establish
that the report of a national bank
examiner is not subject to requisition
by the court, and Attorney Frank J.
Hogan's challenge for the defense that
"Controller Williams or any other
Treasury official must respond to subpoena.
just as any other witness
called," were the only incidents in the
Riggs Bank case today.
This came at the opening of the
court. United States Attorney Uaskey
endeavored to make a point of concession
by the government in allowing
the report of National Bank Examiner
Harm on the Kiggs National Bank, as
of May. 1913, to be brought into court
and placed at the disposal of the attorneys
for the defense. Attorney Hogan
took the stand that the defense
was only asking a right and no legal
favor. District Attorney Laskey permitted
the records to come into court,
but said it did not establish a precedent..
Equity Case Records Read.
The entire time of the court today
was occupied by the government in
reading records of the equity proceedings
by Rlggs Bank officials against
Secretary McAdoo, Controller Williams
I'nitori Stat as Trpasurer John
Burke, which led tip to the indictments
for perjury, for which the Riggs bank
officials now are on trial.
The courtroom was well filled, with
many persons prominent in the business
life of the capital in attendance.
There were a number of women ijt
court today, as there have been on each
of the three preceding days.
A prominent Washington attorney, in
conversation during the noon recess,
said he believed this would be the
greatest legal contest ever conducted
in the District of Columbia and that he
proposed to attend, if possible, every
session. Practically every attorney of
prominence before the District bar has
spent considerable time in court since
this case was called.
Other Witnesses Subpoenaed.
In addition to the witnesses sworn
yesterday, these others have been subpoenaed
by the government:
^V. Morris Lammond and J. Alden
Boteler, former bookkeepers for Lewis
Johnson & Co.
William A. Mearns, Charles P. Williams
and Benjamin Woodruff, former
members of the firm of Lewis Johnson
& Co.
Lewis M. Smith, telegraph operator
employed by Lewis Johnson & Co.
Joshua Evans, cashier of the Riggs
National Bank.
Edward Flather and D. M. Kindleberger,
tellers for the Riggs National
Bank.
P. M. Garnett, clerk for Riggs National
Bank.
John D. Rhodes and Percy Budlong.
shorthand reporters on the trial of
Kiggs vs. Williams.
Sherill Smith, James Trimble and
E. J. Donohue, national bank examiners.
Miss Bessie B. Sheehy, notary public
before whom the affidavits in question
were sworn.
C. E. Gregory, cashier of the National
City Bank of New York, who has been
subpoenaed to bring some records.
Nathan B- M usher, formerly in the
olive oil business in Washington.
Charles A Stewart, chief clerk in the
office of the controller of the Treasury.
Cites Williams' Subpoena.
At the opening of court United .States
Attorney I.askcy railed attenion of the
court to the subpoena issued yesterday
for Controller Williams to bring certain
papers in connection with correspondence
between the Riggs bank
ann the controllers office. He said
most of these papers had been collected
and others were being prepared.
Mr. Uaskey then spoke of the report
of National Rank Kxaminer Hann to
the controller of the Treasury regarding
the condition of the Riggs bank.
He said such reports always have been
considered most confidential. This report.,
he said, will be submitted to the
court* either the original or a photostatic
.copy, but wished this action to
be construed as illustrating the desire
of the government to place everything
desired at the disposal of attorneys
for the defense as far as possibly
can be, but as establishing no precedent
for subsequent, subpoenas for
reports of bank examiners.
Attorney Hogan said the defense
wished the original produced in compliance
with the subpoena. Attorney
Hogari objected also to Mr. I^askey's
appearing in this matter instead of the
subpoenaed witness. The reply was
that "the controller is in the courthouse
and will appear in court when
required."
Attorney William G. Johnson asked

It was evident at this etage of the
proceedings that the prosecution proposed

of a year ago, which would
take all day.

Johnson, for the defense. Attorney
Archer explained why he submitted
these papers, and the court impressed
upon the Jury that these papers are
not in proof of the facts therein stated,
but only to show that such papers have
been legally executed.
Mr. Archer then read the affidavit of
Controller Williams and his reply as
to why the injunction should not stand.

that he had learned that "the
complainant hank, despite reported
admonitipns <>f Treasury officials
had conducted an extensive stock
brokerage business at one time directly
in the name of the bank later
in the names of officers of the bank."
It stated further that these names of
officials were used "as a scheme to de?
fraud." and reiterated all of the Williams
charges .as reported fully in The

Russian prisoners who do not desire to

become citizens. The government has
not yet decided what reply it will make,

be favorable.
The petitioners for the most part are

10 LEAVE MEXICO
United States Consuls Acting
on Instructions of the
State Department.
NO TIME LIMIT FIXED
FOR MILITIA SERVICE
National Guardsmen to Be Mustered
In for Terms of Enlistment or
Until Released.
Further indications that American
army operations on the Mexican border
are still indeterminate as to time
were given today in official quarters.
It was announced at the War Department
that the National Guard of Texas.
Arizona and New Mexico will be
mustered into the army for the period
of their enlistments and with no spe- [
cific time of federal service stipulated.
Secretary Baker saicL mustering offi- 1
cers in charge of the militia mobilization
have inquired whether President
Wilson had fixed any definite term for
enlistment. Because it is not known
how long the guard will'be required,
Secretary Baker explained that it was
ordered that the national guardsmen
will be enrolled for the terms of their
state enlistments or until they are released.
Sent Notice of Conference.
Gen. Scott telegraphed the department
that another conference with
Gen. Obregon was set for 10 o'clock this
morning at El Paso. Secretary Baker
said there was nothing to confirm border
reports that Gen. Scott had served
an ultimatum upon Gen. Obregon for a
final answer upon acceptance or rejection
of the tentative protocol. It was
expected here that Gen. Obregon would
present counter proposals in writing,
particularly regarding fixing a date
for ultimate withdrawal of American
forces.
The War Department had no report
early today on another incursion into
American territory at Blockers Ranch,
near Eagle Pass, Tex. There were also
110 official advices that American troops
had actually crossed the border in the
Big Bend region, although it was believed
probable 4hat some had done so.
American consuls throughout Mexico
have been instructed again to call attention
of Americans to the State Department's
repeated warnings that this
government regards their presence
IIICI C <ao UIIUCOIIUUIV. u>.vt w.?> J J^u.au
ing has stated that ever since the present
difficulty arose, the department's
agents have been urging: Americans to
leave. The last census of Americans in
.Mexico taken by the State Department
six weeks ago showeed less than 3,000
throughout the country. .Most of them
are near Mexico City and- the extreme
east and west coasts, few remaining in
Chihuahua and Sonora.
New Instruction to Consuls.
Secretary Lansing said the new instructions
sent yesterday to the consuls
to renew attention of Americans
that t lie department desires to have
them leave Mexico were primarily to
secure reports regarding the result of j
their endeavors, so far.
Line officers assigned to various serv- !
ice schools, including the Army War i
College, have been graduated far ahead
of time and will hurry back to their j
commando. The officers are now avail- |
aide for duty in the Held, either in connection
with the training of National
Guardsmen or with their regiments.
The forces on the border will get full
complements of officers.
Administration officials today were
hopeful that (Jen. Obregon. Carranza's
war minister, would sign immediately
the military agreement presented at El
Paso by Gens. Scott and Funston. on
behalf of the United States. Despite
the delay of Obregon. it was pointed
nut that Gen. Scott had made no report,
indicating the agreement might
not be signed. Consequently officials
nvere not inclined to believe that the
negotiations would reach the point
ivhere a break would occur between
Mexico and the United States.
Meanwhile some of the additional j
roops recently ordered to the border
ire en route. Mobilization of the Ati-J
zona. New Mexu-o ana icxas .^auunai i

oast artillery posts should the need

EL PASO, Tex., May 11.?Negotiations
looking- toward a settlement of the
American-Mexican military questions
were resumed at 10 o'clock this morning.
The conference was attended by Maj.
Gens. Hugh Scott and Frederick
Funston. representing the United
States, and Gen. Alvaro Obregon, minister
of war of the de facto government.
and Juan N. Amador, subsecretarv
of foreign affairs in Mexico. The
conference, which may be the last, was
held in Gen. Scott's private car.
Gen. Funston desires to strengthen
the border patrol by mounting 2,000
infantrymen on Texas ponies.
The general plans to make this recommendation
to Secretary Baker because
the available forces of cavalry
i for patrol have become practically exhausted.
Gen. Funston points out that
Texas ponies are suited for patrol work,
as they can live on the scanty grass
along the border.
Gen. Funston said that he was considering
calling on the 1st Illinois Cavalry
for patrol work along the Kio Grande,
j He believes that Maj. i.anghorne,
whose troops of the Mh Cavalry were
\\ell over the Kio Grande into Mexico
today, has a good chance of at least
overtaking part of the bandits that
raided Glenn Springs. The general said
the bandits had loaded down wagons
with their loot and thought this would
retard their retreat into Coahuila and
enable Maj. Langhorne's men to catch
up with them.
Outcome Depends Upon Obregon.

American representatives will indicate
to Washington the uselessness of farther

failure to arrive at an understanding
here would mean more than a transfer
of the controversy to diplomatic channels.
The meeting of the conferees was arranged
with the idea of giving Carranza's
minister of war an opportunity
to make his next and what was gener'

situation. The Mexican officers also
were informed that an immediate withdrawal

Whether Gen. Obregon was prepared
to yield enough to justify further delay
in the negotiations here could not
be ascertained before the meeting began.
He said that he was not contemplating
the placing of his signature
to anything at this meeting, hut
added that progress had been made,
however, at previous conferences.
"Yes. we have advanced a little." he
said. There was manifested a feeling
in some quarters that Gen. Obregon

communication with Carranza last
night, and those closely identified with
Mexican interests expressed the opinion
