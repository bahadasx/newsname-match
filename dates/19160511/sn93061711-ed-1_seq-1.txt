JEFF WOODWARD SHOT BY
PAUL HEUHLEH IS DEAD
Jeflf Woodward, candidate for sher
iff, and well known citizen of Quay
county, wax idiot and killed by Paul
Mcublcr, at his farm near Logan.
These gentlemen had lieen the best
of friends and had lieen batching to
gother for several weeks and the re
port came aH a surprise to the many
friends here as well im elsewhere in
the county.
Hfubler and his wife had separate.:
on account of another man, and she
is living in Colorado. .lelf had been
n friend to the family for many years
and it is thought someon" has told
licubter that .lelf was wronging him
and a quurrel ensued, ending in the
death of Mr. Woodward.
Heuhlcr says Jeff tried to shoot him
and he took the gun away from him
and shot him in self-defense. This
story is not believed here for there is
too much difference in the size of the
two men and Mr. Woodward knew
Ilcublcr too well to let him take a
gun from him. In fact he had a hard
time recently keeping him from shoot-1
ing another man. The rcliminary j
will be held in a few days and more
of the fact will no doubt come to
light.
HOY KILLS HIMSELF WITH GUN
An K-year-old son of James Per
kins, who lives near Logan, shot him
self in the head and died instantly
Monday. His parents had gone to a
neighbors when the boy went to the
bed-room and secured his father's re
volver. He put a cartridge in and
told his little sister hit was going to
kill her. She begged him not to and
he said he would kill himself then.
Ho then pointed the gun at his fore
head and pulled the trigger. The ball
did its work. The little girl carried
the little baby to a neighbor's some
distance nway, and told of the trag
edy, and the boy was dead when they
arrived at the house.
TRIES TO SUICIDE
The report reached Tucumcari that
Grady Hodges, son of John Hodges,
who lives near Puerto, tried to com
mit suicido by shooting himself in
the head. The ball failed to pierce his
skull and ranged upward, cutting an
ugly gash in his scalp. A physician
was summoned and the young man Is
getting along as well as could be. He
will recover, it is thought.
WHETHER WOMEN SHALL HE
ALLOWED THE RIGHT TO VOTE
The Young Democrats met Tuesday
night at the special called session to
discuss the big rally day.
After discussing the matter of hold
ing a big Democratic rally, and char
ter a train to visit the railroad towns,
only, it was decided to change this to
a trip through the country. The pres
ident was authorized to appoint a com
mittee to make arrangements for this
rally for some date between June 1st
and 10th. Good state speakers will be
communicated with and something of
quality is expected.
Robert Puncher was appointed press
agent for the Club.
It was decided to settle the Womnn
Suffruge question in New Mexico for
time eternally, now and forever, so n
debute will be pulled off at tho court
house Monday night. May 22, 1010.
Jus. Briscoe and A. L. Zinn were the
cuptains chosen to head the movement
and they will summon to their aid
a few more young democrats to talk
the matter over. Jas. Briscoe, being
single and unmarried, will no doubt
chose the side that favors the right
for women to vote in Now Mexico,
while on the other hand Mr. Zinn will
have to take what's left. The ques
tion will be: Resolved, that the Wo
men of New Mexico He Given the
Right to Vote.
A special invitation will be given
to ladies and a full house is anticipated
to be present on that occasion.
JNO. UOURNE FOR COMMISSIONS
Another especially good man has
announced himself as a candidate for
the nomination for commissioner from
the 2nd district. This makes it easy
to say that the 2nd district certainly
has a fino bunch of men out for the
job of handling the business end of
the county.
John A. Hourno is a native Mlssour
iun, having been born and reared In
that state until he was nine years old.
He then moved to Oklahoma, locating
at Durant, where he lived about 20
years. He was in the mercantile busi
ness, but most of his life has been
spent on the farm. Ho knows the
blacksmith trade and still has consider
able work in that line to do.
Mr. Uoumc moved to Quay county
in the spring of 1007, locating near
Hassell, in the southwest purt of the
county, where he has resided ever
since. Ho owns 100 acres of good
plains hind and has a number of good
grade whitefnee cattle. lie under
stands the valuation of the land and
improvements of New Mexico and
enjoys tho reputation of being a good
man, honest, relinble and upright in
his dealing with his follow men.
Mr. Hourno is an old-time life-long
Dcmocrnt from principle's sake and
not because ho inherited that nfllliu-
tion. Those who know him lst are
his bent friends and hnve no hesitancy
)n recommending Mr. Hourno to tho
voter of Quay county.
JNO. WELCH FOR THE SENATE
The announcement of John Welch,
of Forrest, appears in the News this
week. Mr. Welch is out for the nomi
nation for State Senntor, and says
he's out. to win. He is well known alt
over the county, having served this
county in the hist stato legislature, in
the capacity of representative. He Is
an old Missouri Democrat and knows
how to light the opposition party In
a clean but decisive manner. He is
always in evidence at tiie county po
litical gatherings when Democracy is
back of it. He came to this stite from
Greene county Missouri several years
ago and settled in this county where
he has made a success and believes
in the future of Quay county. He
owns a nice farm near Forrest and
expects, to make that Ids home, but
be feels that he has a duty to perform
for his county and state and would be
glad to receive 'the support of the
voters of Quay county, saying that
they desire him an their state sen
ator in the next state legislature. If
iho mniority of the new legislature
is chosen from the Democratic ranks
Mr. Welch believes his iplnns and
desires would be quite beneficial to
tho citizens of Quay county, providing
he would be able to place them on
the statutes.
In Greene county, Mo., the Repub
licans had a big majority, therefore
he say.i he has scrapped with Repub
licans all his life, and many a time
the Democrats were successful even
in Greene county. If the state senate
is Republican, it will not place Mr.
Welch in an embarrassing position,
for he promises to work for Quay
county with all his might.
Mr. Welch desires that we should
say that his ancestors, even to tho
third ifnd fourth generations were all
strong Democrats; that his wife's folk
were from tho same party and believes
in the principles of Jefferson, Jackson
and Woodrow Wilson.

A CAMPAIGN LIE
Tint Ring Dope that is being circu
lated that I have been brought out by
any faction for campaign purposes,
and the statement that I do not want
the ofllce of county clerk, are all in
famous lies and circulated to prejudice
my friends and the good people of the
.country against me in order to beat
me. I am out in the race to win and
if my friends stay by me as I have al
ways stood by them 1 will be elected
in spite of all of the City Ring's ma
neuvering. 1 did not ask the Ring if
I could make the race and do not ex
pect their support and have not asked
them for it.
I certainly do appreciate the hearty
support 1 am getting from the coun
try as well as the city people and from
my friends all over the county. See
me before believing any of their cam
paign stories. Respectfully,
Dr. J. E. Mannoy.

DEMOCRATS HOLD LIVELY
MEETING HERE SATURDAY
Tucumcari was ftdl of candidates and
other Democrats Saturday from all
parts of the county. A mass meeting
was called to select delegates to tho
state convention at Albuquerque, May
21, when delegates will be chosen to
attend the national convention in St.
Louis.
The precinct committeemen met to
set the dale of the Primary and for
mulate rules for the same. June 17
whs chosen as the date and the News
will publish the rules in full as soon
as possible.
Many questions were ttlken up and
discussed and some were "cussed" but
things will brighten up and the party
leaders will come closer together after
the campaign realy opens up. Quay
county will be represented by a dou
ble set of delegates in Albuquerque,
caclj member having half a vote.
("AN WE AFFORD TO DO IT?
The Hoard of Education of the City
of Tucumcari has called an election
on the 20th of May for the purpose of
issuing bonds to the amount of $i"0,
000, the proceeds of which to be used
for the construction of additional
school buildings.
Taking into consideration that our
present buildings, which have a seat
ing capacity for 000 pupils or more,
only cost $:I8,OI)0.00. this would mean
an increased attendance of 8!!0, or a
total of over MOO children. I believe
that the voters of this district should
have an opportunity before express
ing their wishes at the polls, to havo
an explanation from the Hoard of Ed
ucation. Why such a large bond issue
is contemplated? Several months ago
the editor of the Sun who is a mem
ber of the Hoard, announced that tho
schools of this city were open to the
people of the whole county. Is it not
a matter of fact that the citizens of
the rurnl districts have placed them
selves on record twice by overwhelm
ingly defeating a County High School
proposition at Tucumcari?
Is it not a fact also that the Hoard
in former years collected tuition from
all non-residents, and since last year
no charge of any kind has been made,
thus opening our schools to the very
people who refused to contribute a
mite, about two mills, or possibly less,
to help defray the expense of schooling
their children?
The contemplated bond issue will
add to our city taxes probably three
quarters of one percent and would un
doubtedly keep investors or home
steaders away. Can the people of this
city consistently indorse this measure
under these circumstances? Charity
should always begin at home and wo
believe that the charitable act on
which the Sun editor prided himself
so much will cost the taxpayers of
this city very dearly.
Would it not be more advisable to
go back to the old system and admit
to the Tucumcari schools, the children
of Tucumcari residents, and in this
way save the taxpayers this immense
contemplated additional burden? Wo
believe that the construction of ad
ditional buildings to cost not to ex
ceed 10,000, is ample to take care
of all of our present needs, if this
will be inforced.
Our people know that during the
last three years but very little build
ing has been done and if we increase
our taxes still more, our city will bo
kept at a standstill for years to come.
Will it not l)e best to consider this
matter carefully and be more con
servative, than to put a wall around
our town and keep investors and home-builders-
out?
A Citizen and Taxpayer.

Lily Ellis of Albuquerque deputy su

OUT FOR COMMISSIONER
In announcing my candidacy for
County Commissioner, from the First
District, will say that I am forty-three
l years old, was reared near Jackshorn,
Texas, moved from there to near Ver-
non, Texas, where I lived six years
j before coming here ten years ago, la
this month.
My occupation has been farming
I and stock-raising most of my life, al-
though I have been engaged in other
occupations for short intervals, have
had quite a little experience In laying
out and building roads. I believe and
advocate a road system that would
give us uniform roads in all sections
of the country. I believe that every
able-bodied man between the ages of
21 and HO years should be required to
donate a specified number of days of
labor in his immediate vicinity each
year, except those living within the
limits of an incorporated town or city.
My reason for exempting them is that
the city government always levies a
special tax on them to maintain the
streets, however, it isn't my purpose
to make a long list of promises.
In asking this small fnvor of the
voters of the county, will say that I
havo only one simple promise to make
and that is to give the very best sor
vice that I am able to render for the
development of Quay county.
I served on the board of commis
sioners from HIOll to 101!l, with this
and other experience I don't think any
one would question my qualification.
I have been a Democrat all my life
and have always worked for the ad
vancement of Democratic principles,
sinco casting my first vote, and should
either of my opponents (who are wor
thy and reputable citizens) be suc
cessful in getting the nomination over
me, I will render any sendee possible
towards his election in November.
In conclusion I wish to thank the
mnny friends for their kind express
ions in soliciting my entering the race.

WOMEN CAN VOTE
It seems that a number of the pa
trons of the school district are not
sure just who is eligible to vote on
the school bond question at the coming
election. For the benefit of any who
may be in doubt on this question, the
following information is given:
"Every male citizen of the United
States, who is over the age of twenty
one years, and has resided in New
Mexico twelve months, in the county
ninety days, and in the precinct in
which he offers to vote thirty days,
next preceding the election -shall be
qualified to vote at all elections for
public officers. Women possessing the
qualification described in this section
for male electors shall be qualified
electors at all school elections; pro
vided, that if a majority of the quali
fied voters of any school district shall,
not less than thirty days before any
school election, present a petition to
the board of county commissioners
against woman suffornge in such dis
trict, the provisions of this section re
lating to women sufferage shall bo
suspended therein-- " Art VII. Sec.
1. Court. N. Mex.
By "School elections" the constitu
tion intends to cover all local elections
as to the management, control and ad
ministration of public schools, includ
ing the issuance of bonds, nnd women
have the right to vote on such bond
issue. Opinion Att'y General 1012-1.1
No. 870s.
It will be seen from the nbove that
there are no property qualifications
for voters at the coming election, for
the statutes place the same qualifica
tions on electors for school purposes
as those governing electors for pub
lic officers. We are advised that the
above is the correct legal interpreta
tion of this question regarding quali
fications for voters for the School
Bond issue.
It is hoped thnt every qualified voter
in the district will give this question
due consideration and then go to the
polls on Friday, May 20, and vote in
accordance with dictates of his or her
judgment.
The election will be held in the Gal
legas building on Second street.

ment about at the Sunday school last
Sflfiday morning?
Why. the classes were finding their
respective per centage of efficiency.
Think of that! Small boys and girls

cannot do, without help.
Are we training them for efficient
citizens? Are we making loyal and
true soldiers to the Cross of Christ?
Are we sowing the seeds of good
ness and nobility in the hearts of the
young generation of our Sunday school
For the answer, come and see! Our
