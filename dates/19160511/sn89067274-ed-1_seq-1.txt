diamond stud. Charley and Ab had
been warm friends from childhood

appreciates this remembrance, not

THE BURLINGTON RAIL . -ROAD
EXTENSION
THERE has been a good deal of
talk during the last year regarding
the extension of the Chicago-Burlington
extension west from Francis, and
we have information that we consider
absolutely reliable, that work on this
enterprise will begin this year and
that the railroad will be built from
Francis west, just north of Mexico.
The extension, of the Burlington we
believe should prove of great benefit
to Mexico, as it will largely increase
our railroad facilities. There are few
town anywhere that have better
railroad service than we have, and
that is what helps make a greater
city.

BIG LAD FRAUD SUIT
T. E. Hook and Mrs. Bradford Sap-
ping ton, Among Other Defen
dants ia Florida Case.
CASE IS . AGAIN CONTINUED
Has Been Pending In the Federal
Court at Kansss City Since 1913
Illness Causes Delay.
The' big Florida fruit lands case
which has been pending in the Kan
sas City federal court since 1913,
was continued this week until tie No
vember term of court owing to the
il'ness of Richard J. Bolles of Jack
sonville, Fla., T. E. Hook and Mrs.
Bradford Sappington, among others
of this city, are interested in the ease.
A large number of men had been
subpoenaed on a panel from which a
jury was to be selected to try the ease
and many witnesses had been brought
to Kansas City from Florida and
other parts of the United States. The
continuance of the case means a loss
of several thousand dollars to the
government
The attorney for Bolles submitted
testimony to show that his client, who
U 72 years old, though up and about
his business in Jacksonville has been
suffering from a malady which evi
dences itself in severe attacks. Bolles
physician said that the removal of the
defendant to Kansas City at this time
might result in an attack which would
bring on his death, but if permitted to
rest this summer he probably would
be able to appear at the November
term of court when the weather here
is cooler.
At the opening of the court Albert
D. Hart, former president of the
Florida Fruit Lands Co., and includ
ed in the samo indictment entered a
plea of guilty. There are two indict
ments pending against the defend
ants; one charging the use of the
mails in the furtherance of a scheme
to defraud in connection with the sale
of Florida everglade land; and another
charging the operation of a lottery in
connection with the disposal of the
land.
Bolles, with R. J. Martin and Jos
eph H. Borders of Kansas City, are al
leged to have made the most money
out of the land deals, Martin and
Borders pleaded guilty in 1914. John
Matthews, one of those indicted has
since died. Jesse L, Billingsley, the
seventh defendant, still is in Florida
and has not been extradited. The
government is waiting on a decision
in another Florida case now before
the United States Court of Appeals
before it proceeds further in the Bil
lingsley case.
