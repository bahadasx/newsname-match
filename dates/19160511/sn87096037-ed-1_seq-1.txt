RICHARDS'
A Symbol of Health
The Pythagorians of Ancient Greece
ate simple food, practiced temperance
and purity. As a badge they used the
five pointed star which they regarded
as a symbol of health. A red five
pointed star appears on each package
of Chamberlain's Tablets, and still
fulfils its ancient mission as a symbol
of health. If you are troubled with
indigestion, biliousness or constipa
tion, get a package of these tablets
from your druggest. You will be sur
prised at the quick relief which they
afford. Obtainable everywhere.—Adv.

Richards'
is one of the most won
derful inventions of the
age. It is absolutely
unique. Never before
has there been speed
without harm. Never before have women had any
thing which REALLY made dirt disappear as quickly,
as harmlessly, as EASILY as with this extraordinary
dirt loosener. It does HOURS work in MINUTES.
It positively will not fade colored clothes—shrink or
harden woolen, and will not rot or weaken lace cur
tains so they tear easily, but keeps them STRONG
besides absolutely clean.

Watering the Horses
It has been demonstrated that if a
horse is given grain lirst and then
watered some of the grain is pushed
from the stomach into the intetines be
fore it is digested. This would indi
cate that the horse should at least
have some water before being fed
grain. Again, if the horse real
thirsty and is allowed to drink to ex
cess, it will not eat as much as it
should. Too much water when a horse
is overheated is also dangerous. The

"Out of Many-One"
—a blend of the best parts of staple grains—
wheat, rye, oats, corn, rice—a food that
furnishes the elements for repairing and
building tissue, for physical and mental
energy, a food that gives "staying power"
to hand workers and head workers.
A "creamy," meaty, substantial food
—with a more pleasing flavor than any
other cereal. Truly "the food you never
tire of."

point to keep in mind is that the horse
has a small stomach that holds only a
few gallons. The digestion is largely
done in the stomach. If the grain
fed is pushed out of the stomach be
fore it is digested whether it be by
water or hay some of the value of the
feed is lost.—North Dakota Experi
ment Station.
Who Started The War
There has been quite a number of
stories circulated as to who started
the great European War and here is
another one that has just started on
the rounds:
"The Crown Prince was having a
little chat with his father, the ruler of
Potsdam, and apropes of nothing said:
"Father, who started the war?"
"I know", said his father playfully,
"but I won't tell."
"Did Cousin George start it?" per
sisted the youth.
"No," said the father.
"Did Cousin Nicholas?"
"No"
"Did Franz Joseph?"
"No," reiterated the old man.
"Well, who did then?" insisted
son in a petulant tone of voice.
"Well, as you insist, I'll tell
son. remember when Teddy
Roosevelt came out of Central Africa
and called on us several years ago, I
showed him our magnificent army, our
great and glorious navy, I showed him
our Zeps and the submarines and the
gas bagB and all our big guns and
everything. was greatly im
pressed and when wo were through lie
slapped me on the back and said,
'Bill, my boy, you you can lick the
whole world.' and like a fool I
beleived him."—Ex.

It Improves With Use
There is a delightful thrill in the smoothness with which
the Willys-Knight motor "picks up" without "choking"—
without: the slightest: vibration.
There is great satisfaction in being able to throttle
it clown to a walking pace on high gear.
But the remarkable superiority of the Knight sleeve-^
valve motor lies in the fact that—
Though all other motors grow noisy and lose power
and smoothness—
The Knight sleeve-valve motor grows steadily quieter
with use and increases steadily in power, smoothness and
all-around performance.
The factory's enormous production made it possible to
price this wonderful car at $1125 for the touring car, and
$1095 for the Roadster.
Ask us to tell you about the Willys-Knight.

Built for the
Business Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is
coming out of theground
and the mud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appcarance the Dort merits a careful investi
gation of the Business Fanner.

rooms.
