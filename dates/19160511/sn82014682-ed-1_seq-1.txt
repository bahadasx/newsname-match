Issue is Taken With Judge Ash

: Back to Military Court
" "Everything .that has been' done tn

tera haa tad my aaoction and approval,-
said ' City Attorney Arthur M.
Brown today in answer to a state
ment from Circuit .'Judge Ashford.
which VaS published in the Star-Bulletin
yesterday, In which, the jurist
criticizes a purported police system
. of reducing felony charges to mlsde
' rneanor chargea upon promise of plea
of guilty, and turning the casea of sol
diers over to military ' authorities in
stead of prosecuting them in the civil
courts. - -. ' ; -
-Regarding the violation of local
-laws by soldiers, Mr. Brown contin
ued, "a number of auch cases, here
the offense was not of a serious na
ture, have been turned over to the
military authorities at the request" ol
the latter, the authorities represent
ing their desrre to deal with these of
fenders as they believed would do the
. most good. .
"As the head of the city attorney's
office, 1 desire to take exception to
the statements of Judge Ash ford that
we have been countenancing, the com
pounding of felonies in the police
court of Honolulu by reducing charget
which might be felony charges to mis
demeanors and, so far as I know, no
euch action has been taken by . Mr
Chllllngworth or any other of my dep
uties. :" .'
-As a matter of fact, it has been
the practise for years, where a felony
charge is preferred in' the first in
' stance against the person, to reduce
the same to misdemeanor after,?
careful Investigation and after being
, satisfied that such prosecution is the
proper course. v - . -

ordered the same to be disposed of
In the police court as misdemeanors

Culmnating a long series of hold

in Munua valley, an unknownnian last
night seized and threatened the wife
of a . well-known businessman of the
city and then, put to flight by the
woman's quickness and pluck, disap
peared in the darkness.
As a result of this and other Inci
dents showing that one or more'Iaw-

secticn began today an organized plan
for measures of self-defense. '
A grcup of husbands met this morn
ing, and decided to contribute, to a
fund to bring from the-coast a blood
hound trained in the pursuit of crim
inals; to keep the' dog in the valley
at some central siot where his 'ser
vices arc quickly available almost
anywhere in the sectipn; and to em
ploy a keeper who will worK with the
animal in running down criminal. tres

Furthermore, representatives i pf

tain of Detectives McDuffie this morn
?ng for aid and he will begin instruc
tion of women of the valley in the use
of revolvers. Twice a week, beginning
as soon as It can be arranged, shooting
classes for women will, be held with

The woman shoved him backward
with a quick push and screamed loud

bora heard the call and came hurrying
to the scene. They found prints of
the man's shoes In the mud. He Is
described as a 'small man.
Telephone notice to the police
station brought four detectives to' the
scene, but without result Today oth

Irish; Casualties Heavy
Executed and Given Labor Terms

LONDON, Eng., May 11. Fourteen persons to date have been ex
ecuted in Ireland, convicted of being implicated in the 'Irish rebellion,
it was announced today. Seventy-three others have been sentenced to
penal servitude of six years at hard labor. The announcement was made
by H. J. Tennant, under secretary fcof the war office, in response to a
question put in the, House of Commons.
It is estimated that casualties in Dublin amount to 100O. and that
40Q have been killed, including soldiers, insurgents and civilians. .
Irishmen In U. S. Knew' of Plot
For Revolt Long Before Ootbr
f That the plans for the Irish rebel
lion were known by Irish sympathi
zers In the United States weeks be
fore the actual outbreak of fighting,
.nd that the British government sup
pressed news of the revolt until a
cipher cablegram to New York gave
the news to the New York papers, is
the story which comes to Honolulu
by the latest mail.
Irishmen In New York, including
J those high in the councils of the Unit
ed irisn-Amertcan societies, admitted
that the plans of the Dublin revolu
tionists had f been known here for
more than a week. The news of the
first fighting was received in Ne
York more th-ri 24 hours before its
recipient, an Irishman, sent It to the
newspapers, and two days before the
official announcement of the revolt
came by cable.
Charges were made by Irish leaders
In New York that the sinking of the
German auxiliary, cruiser loaded with
arms and munitions of war for the
revolutionists and the capture of Sir
Roger Casement was made ' possible
by Information "treacherously" sentf
to England by the Washington govern
ment'; These charges have been denied,
flatly by Secretary of State Lansing.
One Jeremiah A. 0Leary told the
New York World that he had learned
that the first news of the Intended
south of Garbundvka on a small front
was repulsed. The enemy suffered
heavy losses. '
