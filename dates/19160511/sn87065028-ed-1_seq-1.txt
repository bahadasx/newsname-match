DEATH OF FORMER COLUMBIAN
RECALLS NOTABLE INCI
DENT. The death of W. H. Kennon,
which recently occurred at Jackson,
has caused Hon. John T. Wood, a
prominent local citizen, to recall an
incident which occurred in 1H7H.
when Piesident Grant appointed Mr.
Kennon postmaster at Columbus,
which position he held until 1SS3,
when he removed to Jackson.
It seems that ether applicants
had been introduced to the Resi
dent as General, Colonel, Major or
Cuptain Blank, nnd when it came to
the turn of Mr. Kennon, who had
lost an arm in the service of the
Union army, he was introduced sim
ply as Mr. Kennon. General Grant
noted his empty sleeve and said:'
"Mr. Kennon, you seem to be the
only man from your section who
done any real fighting," and he
thereupon gave him the appointment
jas postmaster.
