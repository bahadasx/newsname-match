Opening Ball Game of the 1916 Season
by Defeating Monticello
Count of 11 to 3.
Anoka H. S. Will Invade Princeton
Next SaturdayA Speed}
Game is Assured.
The Pi'inceton high school base ball
team started its march to the cham
pionship of this section of the state,
at the Fair Grounds, Saturday, when
it unostentatiously wiped the ^nine
representing the Monticello school off
the athletic map. The final count was
11 to 3, and it might just as well have
been 11 to 0.
Jesmer was on the mound for
Princeton, and after the first inning
had everything his own way. Only
two hits were registered off of his de
livery, and he retired 13 by the strike
out route. With proper support dur
ing the first inning he would have had
a shut-out. Kaliher was at the re
ceiving station, and also did well. Nel
son and Cook were in the points for
the visitors, and they managed to
weather the storm, but that is about
all.
Monticello was the first side at bat,
and started like a miniature Kansas
cyclone. Three errors and two wild
pitches, combined with a base on balls,
netted the visitors three runs, and
prospects did not loom up very bright
from a Princeton viewpoint. The lo
cals evened up the count in their half,
however, and then played real ball
during the balance of the game. Grow
was first up for Princeton, and was
awarded free transportation. Davis
was retired, and then Kaliher nailed
out a hot grounder that was not field
ed properly. Berg came to bat, and
nonchalantly gave the sphere a ride
that carried him to second base it
also carried the crowd to its feet, and
scored the two base runners preced
ing him. G. Angstman drove out a
clean single and Berg counted. R.
Angstman walked, but G. Angstman
was retired while attempting to score
on a wild pitch. The side took to the
field when R. Angstman stepped into
a batted grounder. At the end of the
first inning the count stood 3 to 3, and
thereafter not one of the Wright
county athletes passed the registering
station. Jesmer 'delivered an air
tight article of ball, and he was ac
corded excellent support. Princeton
was blanked in the second round, but
forged into the lead in the third. Kal
iher was retired on an infield fly, but
Berg, who followed him, started
something when he poled out a scorch
ing two-bagger. G. Angstman got on
through the error, and Berg crossed
the plate. R. Angstman went down
on strikes and the side was retired
when Jesmer drove a hot liner at the
pitcher. Princeton failed to count in
the fourth, although Hill and Grow
each connected for safe ones, and the
former got as far as third base. In
the fifth the locals widened the mar
gin that separated them from their
opponents. Berg nailed a sizzling
grounder at the short stop, and reach
ed the initial sack, as a preliminary.
Then G. Angstman and R. Angstman
each poled out safe ones, and Berg
scored. Jesmer was retired on a
grounder, and G. Angstman was
nipped at the plate. Hill walked and
R. Angstman scored on a wild pitch.
The side was retired when Bishop
whiffed. The score now stood 6 to 3,
and just to add to the feeling of
security, Princeton pushed two more
runs over in the sixth. Grow started
this inning with a screaming double,
and Davis straightened one out for a
single, scoring Grow. Kaliher was re
tired, but Berg got on through an error,
and Davis counted. G. Angstman then
poled out a fly to left field that was
caught, and R. Angstman went down
on strikes, retiring the side. Prince
ton slowed up in the sixth, but cinched
matters proper in the eighth. The in
ning opened auspiciously, as Davis,
first up, leaned on a fast one for a
clean single. Kaliher stopped 'one
with his neck, and went to first, and
then Berg ad\anced to bat. He smote
the sphere right on the nose, for the
longest drive of the game, and cleaned
the bases, reaching third himself. G.
and R. Angstman were retired, and
Berg scored on Jesmer's single. The
side was then retired, and the count
stood 11 to 3, which was the final re
sult.
NOTES.
A healthy wind made the dayrfar
from ideal for base ball.
Jesmer pitched a particularly strong
game, and had the opposing swats
men guessing all the time. Thirteen
strike-outs and two hits is some rec
ord for a starter.
Hannay went in for Bishop in the
seventh, but had no opportunity to
distinguish himself.
The attendance was disappointing.
The boys play a fast and snappy game
and are entitled to liberal support.
Coach Jacka is developing a speedy
nine, and Saturday's showing reflected
credit upon him as well as the players.
Two of the Angstmans are again
helping make athletic history at the P.
H. S., and both of the youngsters look
like comers. In the past, the Angst
mans have been stars in the local
athletic firmament.
"Billy" Doane, the boss base ball
authority of these parts, officiated as
umpire, and not even a* feeble kick
was registered by either side. Um
piring is no snap, and to get by with
out a verbal assault is little short of
miraculous.
Next Saturday Anoka will be here,
and a contest replete with thrills is
expected. The locals look particular
ly good, and Anoka always put a pow
erful nine in the field. We don't ven
ture to predict the outcome, but that
the game will be a sizzler is a cer
tainty.
The locals hit the ball hard and
often Saturday, but Berg was the star.
Two doubles and a triple out of five
trips to the plate, gives him a healthy
average. Gi-ow and Davis connected
for two hits as did G. Angstman and
Jesmer. R. Angstman and Hill each
poled out a safe one also.
Kunkle Found Guilt
The case of the State of Minnesota
Vs. Fritz Kunkle, charged with main
taining an unlicensed drinking place,
came on for trial before Justice Dick
ey at the court house hall Monday af
ternoon, without a jury. County At
torney Myron appeared for the state,
and Attorney Frank White of Elk
River for the defendant.
The state summoned five witnesses
Sheriff Harry Shockley, Deputy
Sheriff H. L. Shockley and L. E. Fox,
who made the raid mentioned last
week, and Messrs. Andrew Bryson and
G. H. Gottwerth. The most damaging
feature of the evidence against 'Kun
kle was the fact that the three officers
who made the raid all swore that
Kunkle had admitted to them that he
had disposed of liquor illegally. Mr.
Bryson stated that he had on various
occasions seen people enter the Kun
kle premises and emerge therefrom in
a hilarious condition, while Mr. Gott
werth stated that he lived too far
away from the defendant to know
anything of the case. All the witness
es testified that they had never seen
any drinking on the premises neither
had they seen any liquor purchased
there. All in all the evidence was
hardly conclusive.
The defendant took the stand him
self, and denied admitting to anyone
that he was guilty of disposing of in
toxicants illegally. He also stated
that on the day the raid was made, he
rounded out 61 years of existence on
this earth and was having a party in
commemoration of the anniversary of
his birth. He denied all charges pre
ferred against him, and Messrs. John
Dalchow and Carl Rick, who have
known Kunkle for years, testified that
his reputation as a peaceful, law
abiding and truthful citizen, was
good.
The pleas of the attorneys were
short, and at the conclusion thereof
Justice Dickey pronounced" Kunkle
guilty, and sentenced him to pay a
fine of $50 and costs of prosecution, or,
in default of payment of same, to
serve 60 days in jail.
On motion of defendant's attorney
a stay of sentence of 30 days was
granted, to afford an opportunity to
appeal to the district court. A bond
in the sum of $300 was furnished by
Kunkle, and the case will undoubtedly
be carried up.
Five Charged With 'Tigging."
Five minnows were gathered into the
blind pig net Tuesday when Dan Mir
ick, Wm. Mirick, Louis Stumm, Fritz
Kunkle and Laurence Doyle were ar
rested by Sheriff Shockley on com
plaint of Rudolph Anhaultz, charged
with disposing of intoxicants without
a license. They were brought before
Justice Dickey the same day, all waiv
ed examination, and were bound over
to the grand jury in the sum of $500
each.
Anhaultz is a detective, who has
been in this vicinity the past few
weeks operating as a painter and paper
hanger. His real object was to secure
evidence against violators of the liquor
laws, but those that the finger of sus
picion points strongest against evi
dently were too wary to be caught.
And they will undoubtedly be even
more cautious in the future.
There is no doubt but what a major-

ity of our citizens would welcome a
thorough clean-up. Recent activities
may tend to lessen the evil, and that
would help some.
Cambridge Choral Union Coming.
"The Holy City." a sacred cantata
by Alfred R. Gaul, will be presented
at the Princeton armory next Monday
evening by the Cambridge Choral
Union, and no music lover of this vi
cinity should fail to attend.
Under the direction of Mr. C. H.
Sutherland our neighboring village
has developed a chorus of unusual
merit, and this is its third successful
season in the entertainment field.
Princeton citizens should accord the
visiting organization a generous at
tendance. Last year the hospitable
residents of Cambridge gave the
Princeton fair boosters a royal recep
tion, and this will be our first oppor
tunity to reciprocate.
This is not the prime reason for at
tending, however, as the entertain
ment is bound to pleaseit comes very
highly recommended. Besides the
chorus selections there will be orches
tra numbers, and vocal solos, duetts
and quartets that will delight all. The
soloists include Mrs. H. A. Peterson,
soprano Miss Martina Erickson, con
tralto Mr. Paul Bloom* tenor and
Mr. C. H. Sutherland, bass.
The Union sincerely hopes that the
attendance will more than measure up
to the expectations of the visitors
from our neighboring village.
The Senatorial Situation.
"Bob" Dunn has analyzed the sena
torial situation in this way: "If Sena
tor Clapp is re-elected Senator Nelson
should be recalled. An endorsement
of Mr. Clapp means a repudiation of
Mr. Nelson." Mr. Dunn has stated the
case as it appears to the Tribune. Mr.
Clapo and Mr. Nelson seldom agree
on anything in the senate, and, so
far as their votes go, they counteract
each other and Minnesota would be
reduced to a negative quantity, except
for the fact that there is no man of
greater influence in the senate than
Mr. Nelson. Now, Minnesota's vote
ought to be worth something one way
or the other. If the people of the state
think Senator Nelson is representing
them about as they would like to be
represented they are hardly justified
in giving him for a colleague One whr
takes issue with him and votes against
him on every question of great im
portance. On the other hand, if they
disapprove of Senator Nelson and wish
to indicate that disapproval, the best
way available now is to send back Sen
ator Clapp to continue his opposition
to the senior senator. We should say
that as an analyzer Mr.'Dunn has done
a good job.Minneapolis Tribune.
Mothers' Meeeting.
The W. C. T. U. held a Mothers'
meeting at the home of Mrs. Rev. S.
Johnson on Tuesday afternoon, and it
was pronounced a splendid success by
those present. Refreshments were
served, and an excellent program was
rendered. The program appears here

nia was the immediate cause of death
although Mrs. Holthus had been ailing
for some time.
Funeral services were conducted at
the German Lutheran church in this

ties that win friendship and esteem,
and they will long linger in the mem
ory of those who formed her acquaint
ance.
Dies of Heart Failure.
Sudden heart failure caused the
death of John Lane, a respected resi
dent of this vicinity, while he was
plowing the Umbehocker tract of land
in north Princeton, last Friday morn
ing.
The last sad rites were conducted at
the Methodist church Sunday after
noon, and numerous friends and neigh
bors attended. Rev. E. B. Service offi
ciated, and interment was in Oak
Knoll cemetery..
The subject of this sketch was born
in New York state on May 20, 1842,
so at the time of his death was 74
years, 11 months and 15 days old. He
had been a resident of this state 15
years.
Mr. Lane was twice married, and
two sons by the first marriage sur
vive, viz: Sam A. Lane, and Sidney
Lane.
On June 4, 1913, he was married to
Mrs. Esther Kimball, and she also sur
vives.
Mr. Lane joined the Methodist
church two years ago, and was al
ways a faithful attendant. His death
marks the passing of a good citizen.
Ogilvie vs. Princeton.
The Princeton regulars broke in
their new uniforms Sunday afternoon,
when the entire squad was out oppro
priately garbed. The boys had a good
work-out, and regular practice the
past few weeks has placed them in
condition to start the season. -The
opener will be staged at the fair
grounds next Sunday, when the stal
wart Ogilvie aggregation will cross
bats with Princeton. Ogilvie always
has a fast nine in the field, and last
fall it trounced the Mora leaguers at
the Kanabec county fair. The locals
will give a good account of themselves
and the fans are promised a real ball
game. A large attendance is expected,
as it will be Princeton's first opportun
ity to see Nevitt, the Indian hurler, in
action. As announced at the banquet
ladies will be charged 15c before being
permitted to enter the grounds. This
is the custom of all the neighboring
villages, but the management here did
not take this step until it became ab
solutely necessary.
Farmers* Club Rally.
The Glendorado Farmers' club is to
have, an afternoon meeting on the 17th
of May, as a sort of a general rally
for the entire surrounding country.
Everybody is invited to attend, and
especially is an invitation extended to
all farmers' clubs in Benton county.
A program has been arrangeoLfor,
including selections by the Glendorado
brass band that will furnish a part of
the music and make its first appear
ance in public. This band consists of
fourteen pieces and is doing business
under a skilled leader from Princeton,
who is engaged by the band by the
year as instructor.
The main speaker of the occasion
will be the Hon. A. F. Teigen, member
of the Minnesota legislature from
Chippewa county, and better known
as the farmer orator of the house of
representatives, and one of its most
forceful members. His subject will
be "The Marketing Question of Farm
Products and the Effect of Legislation
Upon the General Prosperity of the
Producer."
The committee in charge have also
secured Hon. R. C. Dunn, to deliver a
short speech on the question of "Good
Roads."
This celebration will be held near
3 i a
the Glendorado store, where there is
ample shade in case of a warm day,
and a good sized hall to fall back on
in event that it rains. The program
commences at 1 o'clock p. m. The
Glendorado Farmers' club is paying
all expenses of this celebration, so no
charge will be made, except at the re
freshment stand where cigars, ice
cream and soft drinks can be had at a
moderate charge.
The farmers of that entire section
have decided to lay aside for a few
hours their farm work to attend this
meeting, as it is generally realized
that it will be the treat of the season.

Fire Wipes Out Dwelling House.
Fire of an unknown origin destroyed
the Wm. Miller residence and practic
ally all of its contents Monday morn
ing at 10:30 o'clock. Had it not been
for the efficient work of the fire de
partment, there is no doubt but what
numerous other buildings would have
been wiped out or badly damaged, as
a high wind prevailed and various
dwellings became ignited. The de
partment boys were on the scene im
mediately after the sounding of the
alarm, but they realized that to at
tempt to save the Miller residence
would be futile, and confined their
efforts to preventing damage to other
property. Their work was commend
ed by all.
Mrs. Miller was in the house, but
she has no idea as to where or ho*r
the fire started. The first she knew of^
it, the flames appeared everywhere.
Mrs. Miller rushed upstairs to get her
watch, but the fire and smoke pre
vented her from returning by way of
the stairs, and she was forced to jump
from the window. A sprained ankle
resulted.
The loss is not definitely known, but
it was only partially covered by in
surance. There was $1,000 on the
building and $1,000 on the furniture.
Olson-Van Kleek.
Last evening at the home of the
bride's parents in Blue Hill, Mr. John

ence of a few invited relatives and
friends. Rev. M. Peterson *f the-.

friends extend to them choicest con
gratulations.
