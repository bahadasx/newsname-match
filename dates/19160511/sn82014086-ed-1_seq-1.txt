Desire to Return to Russia.
Vienna, Monday. May 8. (Via Ber

to The Associated Press, via Sayville,
May 10). More than 60,000 Russian
prisoners who do not desire to return
to Russia have signed a petition to
the Austro-Hung-arian government
asking that they be permitted to re
main in this country after the war and
become citizens. The government has
not yet decided what reply it will
make, but it is probable that the an
swer will -be a favora'ble one.
The petitioners for the most part are
men who have learned German on the
farms where they have been employ
ed. Many more Russians, probably
209,000,-are said to have expressed an
eagerness to stay in this country, but
the government is discouraging the
signing of further petitoons pending
action by the legislative bodies on the
subject.
LONDON VIEW OF ;
SINKING OF CYMRIC
Not Anticipated it Will Cause a Break
With the United States.'
London, May 10, 6.09 p. m. In offi
cial circles here it is not anticipated
that the finking of the White Star
liner Cypvic will cause a breach be
tween Germany and the United States.
While, according to the admiralty, the
Cymric was an ordinary freighter on
which the government was sending
freight in common with private ship
pers, the fact that no Americans were
on board and the doubtful status of
the ship create a belief that Washing
ton is hardly likely to make an issue
of the smKmg.
It is known that American officials
here are making the usual inquiries.

SIMPLER LIVING ADVISED BY
BISHOP WILLIAM LAWRENCE
In Annual Address at Massachusetts
P, E. Diocesan Convention.
Boston, May 10. Bishop William
Lawrence in his address today at the
annual diocesan convention of the
Episcopal church questioned the ad
equacy of present preparedness plans.
"We must recognize," he said, "that
as self-defense is the first instinct of
a man. it is until higher forces pre
vail the first instinct of a nation. The
question which I ask is whether these
special forms of preparedness, being
followed by the people of this nation
in a fresh burst of patriotism, are
really but little more than superficial
preparation.
Or what use is It If a young wo
man camp and march for three weeks,
if marching in high-heeled shoes and
living in luxury she passes the rest of
the year? Of what gain is it for young
men to stop tneir cocktails and slack
morals for six weeks camp if they
take them up again for 46 weeks?
In other words, the call of today is
to my mind a call to simpler living."
ALL RAILWAY SAFETY
RECORDS BROKEN IN 1915
325 American Roads Went Through
Fiscal Year Without a Fatality.
Chicago, May 10. All railway safety
records were 'broken in 1915 when 325
American roads, reporting to the bu

ity to a passenger in a tram accident.
The roads reporting operate 161.948
miles of line. It i3 stated that this
record of safe operating has never
betn equalled by the railroads of any
other country.
All American roads in 1915. onerat
ing over 250,000 miles of line, report
ed 196 passengers killed in all railway
accidents. In compadison, the latest
returns for Europe, with 197,015 miles,
snow oo passengers thus killed. The
decreasing hazard to trainmen is
shown by the fact that 285 were em
ployed for one killed, 832. the best rec
ord set in that respect.

LABOR CONDITIONS ARE
DEMORALIZED BY PROSPERITY
According to Speakers at Meeting of
Employment Managers.
Boston, May 10. The inrosneritv that
has come to workingmen out of war
orders nas demoralized labor condi
tions, according to speakers at a mAPt-r
ing of the Employment Managers As
sociation here today. "Workingmen
are glutted with too much pay and
like to show their independence by
loang after they have made a normal
amount each week and by roving
when they tire in the least of their
place or employment," said L. O. Pe-
thick of New Haven, Conn. These
were reasons, he added, why men were
hard to get and harder to keep.
Pension systems offered as a means
of keeping employes in continuous ser
vice, the - speaker asserted, aroused
suspicion among the workers.

EL PASO CONFERENCE
Obregon Still Refuses to Exchange
Ratifications" With General Scott.
Washington, May 10. Further de
velopments in the Mexican situation
still awaited tonight a definite out
come of the El Paso conferences be
tween Generals Scott, Funston and
Obregon. Officials of both the war
and state departments appeared con
fident that an agreement satisfactory
to both sides would be negotiated, al
though they hesitated to predict how
much more time might be required.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
called on Counsellor
Polk at the state department late in
the day. Both he and Mr. Polk said
the visit had no significance. Mr. Ar
redondo had no additional advices
from his government to present and
Mr. Polk could give him no news as
to the conference at El Paso.
Report from General Scott.
Secretary Baker received a report
from General Scott on the long dis
tance with General Obregon last night.
It stated that while the Mexican min
ister had talked over a suggestion fot
co-operative border patrol, the propo
sition was not formally presented as a
substitute, for the protocol previously
worked out. General Scott did not
transmit details of the new discussion
but indicated that he expected Gen
eral Obregon to submit his new plan
later.
Obregon's Course Puzzling.
The course of General Obregon' at
El Paso has been, puzzling. Adminis
tration officials have reason to believe
that General Carranza has given his
nssent to the agreement as originally
framed except in minor details. The
plan was suggested, in part at least,
by General Obregon himself, when the
conferees first met, yet Obregon has
refused thus far to exchange ratifica
tions with General Scott.
Hint at Playing Politics.
In some quarters it was thought the
Mexican war minister might be seek
ing political benefit from the tactics
he has adopted. There is no official
information tending to support this
view, although intimations of friction
between Carranza and his war min
ister have been published frequently.

New York, May 10. The progressive
party yii not insist upon the noml
nation of Theodore Roosevelt for pres
ldent of the United States, if the re
publicans will name a candidate at
Chicago "who stands for progressive
principles and is able to put them
through," according to a statement
made tonight by George W,, Perkins,
following a meeting of the executive
committee of the progressive nation
al committee.
"We. of course, are for Colonel
y-i
Rebated
Shows Daily
Roosevelt, ' declared Mr. Perkins, "and
shall suggest his name to the repub
licans. If they reply that they will
not agree on the colonej i we shall ask
them to name us their rj an, who ought
to be as nearly unanimjais a choice as
our man is. We are w ing to be rea-
sonaoie ror tne sake of! (harmony ."
Mr. Perkins' statement supplement
ed a general statement issued by the
executive committee in which it was
said:
Will Rise Above Partianship.
"If the republican convention is re
spoi.Ive to the patriotic spirit that
brought the republican party into be
ing and made it dominant for half a
century, it will meet this crisis in a
spirit of broad patriotism that rises
above partisanship. Should the ef
fort fail, the responsibility for the re
sult will not rest on the progressive
convention, but will rest on other
shoulders than ours."
Will Not Stick on Details.
"In this turning point in world his
tory we will not stick on details. We
will lay aside partisanship and pre
judices, but we will never surrender
the principles for which we stand and
have stood and will follow only a
leader who we know stands for them
and is able to put them through. We
are for peace, but for peace at any
price."
Appeal to Get Together.
It was said that the republicans and
independent voters in general had re
sonded "understandingly to the senti
ments expressed" in the statement is
sued in January by the progressive
national committee, which, in effect.
was an appeal for republicans and
progressives "to get together"'. It
was added, however, that "there is an
element in the republican party lead
ership which seems to be giving more
tnougnt and attention to what that
party is against and whom it is
against, than to what it is for and
whom it is for. Therefore, we again
call attention to our Chicago state
ment, as to the inevitable outcome of
a failure to reach a common under
standing." Need a Reawakening.
"Reports from the progessive or
ganization throughout the country."
the executive committees statement
said, "show that the American people
have beconie impatient of leadrs wno
hold that comfor, prosperity and ma
terial welfare are above honor, self
sacrifice and patriotism: that we ned
a re-awakening of our older Ameri
canism, of our belief in those things
that our country and our flag stand
for; that our people are seeking a
leadership of the higest order and
most courageous character-leadership
that will draft to itself for the coun
try's benefit the unselfishness and pa
patriotic service of our ablest citizens
Our people are demanding that prin
ciples and policies shall be proclaimed
and carried out by a man who has the
wisdom to formulate them and the
manhood to uphold them."

cause other than this attack of a Ger
man submarine, cannot be maintained
Facts About the Sussex.
"Such an assumption has to be ar
rived at with certainty from the ma
terial in the possession of the Oermnr
government, for itself and without
further knowledge of the circum
stances connected with the torpedoing
of the Sussex, the more so as apan
from the points enumerated In the note
-ne lum ultimo, the following facts
had come to the attention of the ad
miralty staff of the navy through re
liable information: March 24, 1916, ap
proximately at the-same time as th
Sussex, an auxiliary warship, left th
port of Folkestone with a large trans
port of British infantry on board; on
the same day a transport steamer was
torpedoed in the channel; a few min
utes preceding the. explosion on the
Sussex she had passed through a mass
of ship wreckage, which created the
impression that a ship had sunk al
that spot shortly before. All thes
facts justified the conclusion, that th
only case of torpedoing which could b
considered under the circumstance
had struck the British war vessel,
whereas the Sussex had met with an.
accident in some other way. -
Admits Submarine Sank Sussex.
"However, on the basis of the Amer
ican material, the German government
cannot withhold its conviction that the
ship torpedoed by the German subma
rine is in fact identical with the Sus
sex, for, in accordance with th;s ma
terial, the place, the time and the ef
fect of the explosion by which the
Sussex was damaged, .agree in the es
sential details with the statements of
the German commander, so that there
can no longer be any question of the
possibility of two independent occur
rences. An additional reason is con
stituted by the fact that officers of
the American navy found fragments of
an explosive in the hold of the Sussex
which are described by them upon firm
grounds as parts of a German torpedo.
Counter-Evidence.
"Finally, the counter-evidence which
was deducted in the note of the 10th
ultimo from the difference in appear
ance of the vessel described by tbe
submarine commander and the only
reproduction of the Sussex then avail
able has proven to be untenable, in
asmuch as according to a photograph
of the damaged Sussex now to hand,
the characteristic distinctions no
longer existed at the time of the acci
dent: while the Sussex in this photo
graph of the Daily Graphic enclosed in
the note only carried one mast and
also showed the white gangway cus
tomary on passenger vessels on the
level with the portholes, O. W. S., the
reproduction of the damaged Sussex
shows a second mast and a uniform
dark color and thus approaches In her
outer appearance the description of the
vessel as furnished by the submarine
commander.
Commander Acted in Good Faith.
"In view of the general impression
of all the facts at hand, the German
government considers it beyond doubt
mat tne commander of the submarine
acted in the bona fide belief that he
was facing an enemy warship. On the
other hand, it cannot be denied that,
misled by the appearance of the ves
sel, under the pressure of the circum
stances he formed his Judgment too
hurriedly in establishing her character
and did not therefore act fully in ac
cordance with the instructions which
called upon him to exercise particular
care.
Sincere Regret Expressed.
"In view of these circumstances. th
German government frankly admits
that the assurance given to the Ameri
can government. In accordance with
which passenger vessels were ,not to
be attacked without warning, has not
been adhered to in the present case.
As was intimated by the undersigned
in the note of the 4th instant, the
German government does not hesitate
to draw from this resultant conse
quences. It therefore expresses to tie
American government its sincere re
gret regarding the deplorable incident
and declares its readiness to pay an
adequate indemnity to the Injured
American citizene. It also disapproved
of the conduct of the commander, who
has been appropriately punished.
"Expressing the hope that the
American government will consider the
case of the Sussex ae settled by these
statements, the undersigned . avails
himself of this occasion to renew to
the ambassador the assurance of his
highest consideration.
"VON JAGOW."
