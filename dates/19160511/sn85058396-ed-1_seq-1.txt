STIR THE PUBLIC
Both Houses of Parliament Oc
cupied With Discussion of
Executions and Dissatis
faction With Administration.
London, May 11, 11.25 a. m. Irish
; affairs occupied today even a more
important position in the public mind
than they did at tho time of the home
rule controversy. Both houses of par
liament are again engaged with them
today. John Dillon's motion for dis
cussion of the executions in Ireland
comes up in the house of commons and
the house of lords is considering Lord
Lorebuni's motion expressing dissat
isfaction with the Irish administra
tion. The debato in the house of com
mons is regarded as the more Import
ant for there the government comes
under the iirossfica of -the whole Jrish
party and of a large number of liberal
members who arc determined to bring
to an end not only arrests and execu
tions in Ireland, but martial law.
The execution in County Cork of
Thomas Kent, although it took place
before Premier Asquith gave his as
surance that no further death senten
ces would bo carried out until tho de
bato was concluded, has brought forth
further protests from Irish parliamen
tary circles. The Nationalists alBo
are concerned at the continued arrest
and deportation to England for con
finement iu English jails of rebels
from all parts of the country The
number of arrests has not yeU been
made known, but it must bo several
thousand.
A number of lists containing 400 or
more names of persons arrested have
been published.
The latest estimates of casualties in
Dublin places them at about 1,000, of
which 400 were killed. These fig
ures Include soldiers, insurgents and
civilians.
The fact iB noted in Dublin that
since the insurrection there has been
an increase in the rate of recruiting
there.
Even while the controversy over the
cause and manner of hnndling the in
surrection is still in progress, efforts
are being made to reach a compromise
on the home rule question Those who
most desire this are urging that Lord
Hnrdinge, after he has concluded his
Inquiry into the disturbances shall be
appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
It is believed that a diplomat would
be more likely to bring the two par
ties together than would a politician
There are rumors In parliamentary
circles that negotiations of some kind
are being nrranged and that Sir Ed
ward Carson and John Redmond, the
leaders of the two parties are copcern
ed with them.

season Saturday, May 13, consummat
ed. Due to an excess of work, in con
nection with his office, County Treas
urer Joseph Storey tendered Ills re
signation as president of the leaguo.
The resignation was accepted and
John Browning, managor of the
Browning Brothers Sporting Goods
company, was elected president. D.
E. Davis resigned tho position of sec
rotary of tho leaguo and was roplacod
by Alonzo West.
Forfeits of -?r0 each, binding the
teams to bo on hand to play at the
place designated on the playing daes,
were deposited and a strong founda
tion for tho leaguo was made, with
two teams from Ogden and one each
from Garland, Brigham, Logan and
Preston on the roster. All of the
clubs, but Preston, were represented
at tho meeting, the managers present
being W. E. Davis, Brigham City; O.
R. Francis, Garland; Ray Olson, Lo
gan and J. W. O'Brien (Utah Power)
and Leland Williams (Utakmado), Og
den. Joseph Storey called the mooting to
order and announced tho resignation
of himself and Mr, Davis. The elec
tion of Messrs. Browning and West
followed. The schedule of games was
presented to the magnates but, owing
to the inability of tho Preston and
Logan teams to get into playing form
this week, tho schedule was not adop
ted and will require changing to somo
extent, when the two teams farthest
north get Into tho game.
The taking on of Preston and Logan
was due to the withdrawal of Lay ton
and tho Never Rips (Ogden) and the
spirit at the meeting last night seem
ed to be that the new arrangement
would work out more advantageously
than the one first planned, as Pres
ton and Logan are good ball towns
and can each put a strong lineup into
the league. It is anticipated that the
commercial clubs of tlus Boxelder and
Cache county towns 111 get behind
their teams strong and good baseball
is nromised in return.
--The opening game of the season in
Ogden, will be played Sunday, witli
the Utah Power and Light team op
posing tho Brigham City nine. Satur
day, the "Power" boys wlir play the

Ei Paso, May 11. Major General
Frederick Funtson, commanding the
southern department of the United
States army, desires to strengthen the
border patrol by mounting two thou
sand Infantrymen on Texas ponies.
Tho general plans to make thiB rec
ommendation to Secretary of War
Baker because the available forces
of cavalry for patrol purposes have
become practically exhausted, Gen
eral Funston points out that Texas
ponies aro suited for patrol work, be
ing ablo to maintain themselves on
scanty grasses along the Mexican bor
der where the regular cavalry mounts
are hardly able to exist
May Call Illinois Cavalry.
General Funston said that he was
considering a proposition of calling
upon the First Regular Illinois caval
ry national guard for patrol work
along the Rio Grande.
General Funston said he thought
that Major Langhorne and his troops
of the Eighth cavalry were well over
tho Rio Grande into Mexico today and
that the Americans had a good
chance of at least overtaking part of
tho bandits that raided Glenn Springs.
The general said he had learned that
some of the bandits had loaded down
wagons with their loot and thought
this would retard their retreat Into
Coahulla and enable Major Lang
horue'8 men to catch up with them
and give battle.
Generals 'Re-open Conference.
Negotiations looking toward a set
tlement of the American-Mexican mili
tary questions' were resumed at 10
o'clock this morning between Major
Generals Hugh L. Scott and Frederick
Funston, representing the United
States, and General Alvaro Obregon,
minister of war of the de facto gov
ernment and Juan N. Amador, sub
secretary of foreign affairs in Mexi
co. Tho conference, which may be
the last, was held in General Scott's
private car.
No Misunderstanding at Border
General Obregon and Juan N. Ama-
have no misunderstanding of the po
sition of the American representa
tives. They have been told that they
came here to discuss co-operation of
American and Mexican troops in
Mexico and not the withdrawal of the
American forces.
To the Carranza representative's
counter proposal that they agree to a
time limit for the withdrawal of the
forces, General Scott said he was not
empowered to talk of that phase of
the situation. The Mexican officers
also were informed that an immedi
ate withdrawal of General Pershing's
force was out of the question.
Whether General Obregon was pre
pared to yield enough to justify fur
ther delay In the negotiations here
could not be ascertained before the
meeting began. He said that he was
not contemplating the placing of his
signature to anything at this meeting,
but added that progress iad been
made, however, at previous confer
ences. "Yes we have advanced a little,"
he said.
Theie was manifested a feeling In
some quarters that General Obregon
" was ready to yield more than he indi-
cated, however. He was in telegraphic
communication with Carranza last
' night and those closely Identified with
Mexican Interests expressed the opin
ion that he might be authorized to
give In at the last minute.
Washington, May 11. Further indi
cations that American army opera
tions on tho Mexican border are still
indeterminate as to time were given
today in official quarters. It was an
. uounced at tho war department that
tho National Guard of Texas, Ariz.,
. and New Mexico will be mustered
i into tho army for the period of the
', irregular state enlistments and with
, no specific time of federal servico
stipulated.
General Scott telegraphed the de
partment that another conference
with General Obregon was set for 10
o'clock this morning at El Paso. Sec
retary Baker said there was nothing
to confirm border reports that Gen
eral Scott had served an ultimatum
upon General Obregon for a final an
swer upon acceptanco or rojectlon of
the tontatlvo protocol.
Crossing of Border Unconfirmed.
The Avar department had no report
early today on another incursion into
American territory at Blocker's
ranch, near Eagle Pass, Texas. There
were also no official advices that
American troops had actually crossed
the border in the Big Bond region, al
though It was believed probable that
somo had dou'e so.
American consuls throughout Mex
ico have been Instructed to again call
attention of Amoricans to the state
department's repeated warnings that
this government regards their pres
ence thero as undesirable. Secretary
Lansing has stated that ever since the
present difficulty arose the depart
ment's agents have been urging
Americans to leave. Tho last census
of Americans In Mexico taken by the
Btate dopartinent six weeks ago,
showed less than 3000 throughout the
country. Most of them are near Mex
ico City, "and extreme east and west
coasts, few remaining- in Chihuahua
and Sonoxa. j
Americans Asked to Leave Mexico. I
Secretary Lansing said tha new in-1
structlons sent yesterday to the con-
suls to renew attention of Americans H
that the department desires to have H
them leave Mexico was primarily to H
secure reports regarding tho result H
of their endeavors so far. MM
Line Officers Graduated. H
Lino officers assigned to various MwM
service schools, including tho army H

ahead of time and will hurry back to H

American consuls, under their orlg- H
inal instructions to warn Americans H
from Mexico, were authorized to leave H
their posts and return to the United mwM
