CVCLE mi
TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD SON OF
MR. AND MRS. ALFRED LEGER
MEETS TRAGIC DEATH AT VAL­
LEY STREET SOO CROSSING
SUNDAY.
Raymond Leger, only son of Mr.
and Mrs. Alfred Leger, who have re­
sided on a farm seven miles north of
Minot for many years, met with a fa­
tal accident at the east end of Valley
street in this city, Sunday morning,
shortly before noon. Raymond was
riding his Harley-Davidson moto*
cycle which he had recently purchas­
ed. In company with Colmar Bale
rud and two other young men, all rid­
ing motorcycles, Raymond started out
of the city traveling east. He had
come into the city early that morning,
attending services at St. Leo's Catho­
lic church, and concluded to take a
short ride before returning home. The
wind was blowing at a fierce gale and
as the dust was blowing fearfully, the
companions, who were some distance
in the rear of Raymond, did not see
the accident very clearly. He was
running along on high at perhaps 20
or 25 miles an hour when he noticed
a box car being backed over the cross­
ing at the spur near the Soo round­
house. He was diverted from his
course striking the crossing at the
south end. He kept astride his motor­
cycle, however, which had been turned
from the road. He tried to turn the
machine back onto the grade, plowing
up the side of the grade until the ma­
chine struck the end of a culvert a few
feet beyond. The machine turned tur­
tle and the rider was thrown to the
hard road with terrific force, striking
on his head. A horrible gash was cut
in the right side of the head and Ray­
mond was'rendered unconscious. His
companions came up to where he lay
and bathed his face with water, but
failed to revive him.
An auto in which Jacob Gordon,
Louis Sitner, Mf. Lyons and Mr. Lin
ha were riding came along and the
young man was carried to a local hos­
pital. He died at 10 o'clock^ that night
from concussion of the brain, without
regaining consciousness.
The funeral was held from St. Leo's
Catholic church Wednesday morning
at 9 o'clock and interment was made
in the Catholic cemetery.
Raymond was born in this city and
would have been twenty-one years of
age in about two weeks. He was .a
fine Christian young man and was ex­
ceedingly popular with his associates.
He had become well acquainted with
other, young men over the county at
the Boys' Better Farming School in
which he took unusual interest. He
took a great deal of interest in the
farm work and in every way was a
most dutiful son.
The mother has been seriously ill
for several weeks and the news of the
death of her only child came as a ter
rible shock. A host of friends extend
their sincerest sympathy to the sor­
rowing parents.

Miss Myrtle Jacobson, who teaches!
school No. 2 in St. Mary's district, will
close her labors in St. Marys on
Thursday. Miss Jacobson has given
the best of satisfaction and it is to be
hoped that the board will retain her,
services for another year, giving her)
a substantial increase of salary to
show their appreciation of her ser­
vices. The sooner school boards
awaken to the advantage a district
obtains in continuing an efficient
teacher in their employ, the sooner
will one of the gravest problems af­
fecting the welfare of our schools be
solved. This continual change of
teachers is a great draw back to the
advancement and progress of pupils
in their studies. A thorough, capable
and conscientious teacher deserves and
appreciates an acknowledgement of
faithful service.
J. M. April left Sunday for Gutten
burg, Iowa, where he wall spend a few
weeks visiting relatives. Mrs. April,
who it at Guttenberg, will in all prob­
ability return with him. Jack expects
to be gone at least a month. In the
meantime Burlingtonites are having
their tonsorial needs looked after by
the genial "Bob" Norton, who is al­
ways on the job, early and late.
Joe Wistrom has fully recovered
from his recent illness and is now up
and around looking after his draying
business.
Little Elizabeth Wistrom, who has
been staying at the home of her
grandmother, Mrs. John Campbell, the
past winter and attending school, is
again at home, suffering from typhoid
fever. Her condition.is considered very
serious, but it is hoped that with the
best of medical attention and careful
nursing she may safely pass the crit­
ical period.
H. A. Kluver, cashier of the First

erous in town that there is some talk
of parking the machines in the center
of Main street in order that the cars
of those driving into town to trade
may have the use of the space next
the curb. Not a bad idea at that.
An immense amount of side walk
will be built here as soon as the spring
seeding is over and a few laborers
can be secured by Casteel Bros., the
local firm who make a specialty of
concrete work.
What's the matter with Burlington
Wasn't this the place where McGraw

have to get Big Chief back here and
wake the old town up. We must have
a ball-team.
Entries for Vegetable Contest Close
May 15.
The entry list for the vegetable gar­
den contest will close May 15th, next
Monday. All interested should mail
their coupons of entry at once to the
secretary of the City Beautifying
League, Mrs. T. J. Vincent, if they
have not already done so.
The members of the League believe
very firmly that not only are vege
table gardens a benefit to the owners
in keeping down the high cost of liv­
ing, but that they are practical means
of beautifying the city. A well ar­
ranged and well kept garden is really
a thing of beauty and to encourage the
maintenance of such the League has
offered three cash prizes, one of $5.00,
one of $3.00 and one of $2.00. There
is no reason why exhibits from the
gardens entered in this contest should
not be entered in the vegetable show
to be held in August. There is cer
tainly opportunity to harvest cash as
well as vegetables from Minot gar­
dens this season.
Those whose gardens were submerg­
ed by the high water recently admit
that they are somewhat handicapped
in the contest, but they haven't drop­
ped out of the race because of this,
and say that they are going to make
their compettiors on higher ground
hustle for the prizes.

WATERING THE HORSE.
It has been demonstrated that if a
horse is given grain first and then
watered, some of the grain is pushed
from the stomach into the intestines
before it is digested. This would in­
dicate that the horse should have at
least some water before being fed
grain. Again, if the horse is real
thirsty and is allowed to drink to ex­
cess, it will not eat as much as it
should. Too much water when a horse
is overheated is also dangerous. The
point to keep in mind is that the horse
has a small stomach that holds only a
few gallons. The digestion is largely
done in the stomach. If the grain feed
is pushed out of the stomach before it
is digested, whether it be by water or
hay, some of the value of the feed is
lost.—N.

HOLM MAN OUT
FOR COMMISSIONER
WALTER ARCHIBALD, WELL
KNOWN RETIRE DMERCHANT,
FLINGS HIS BONNET IN THE
RING.
Walter Archibald, of Foxholm, was
in the city on business Tuesday. Mr.
Archibald informs the Independent
that he will be a candidate for the re­
publican nomination for commission­
er from the Second district, at the
June primaries. His announcement
appears in this issue of the Indepen­
dent.
Mr. Archibald has been a resident
of the county for the past twelve
years. During most of that period, he
was engaged in the mercantile busi­
ness at Foxholm, making an unquali­
fied success. Mr. Archibald is a fine
fellow and will undoubtedly poll a
large vote in the western end of the
district where he is well known. He
will spend the next three months cam
aiming and expects to meet practi­
cally every voter of the district.
The Farmers State Bank of Falqen
with a capital of $15,000 has been or­
ganized. There are 22 stockholders,
consisting of some
at
the best busi­
nessmen and farmers of that vicinity.
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
Warrants have been issued for
twenty-one alleged speeders, who are
charged with driving faster than 15
miles an hour up old Ward street, now
known as Second street N. W. This
is a favorite street for the "boys" who
like to "step on the tails" of their
autos. The police were stationed
along the street Saturday evening and
found just twenty-one who are said
to have gone too fast. Four of them
paid fines of $9 each Monday and oth­
ers are expected to liquidate. Altho
the ordinance forbids anyone driving
faster than ten miles an hour in the
city, no attention will be paid if cars
are kept under 15 miles an hour. The
police say they will keep a strict
watch and nab all violators.
WHY THE IRISH WEAR GREEN.
Secretary Holbein has "gotten in
bad" with his Irish friends by telling
the following story: In the early
days, Ireland was infested with great
large rats that became so obnoxious
that an immense lot of cats were im­
ported. They cleaned out the rats,
but became so obstreperous that some­
thing had to be done, so the good peo­
ple shipped in a lot of gorillas. These
animals got rid of the cats all right,
but were soon considered so objection­
able that an edict was issued that all
of the gorillas be shot. When the
work was started, it was found that
soon four Irishmen were killed by mis­
take, so an order was issued that all
Irish should wear green as a mark of
distinction. "And that is why the
Irish today are partial to green," the
secretary added.
Minot Chapter Masons Work Degrees
at Bowbells.
A degree team from the Tyrian
Chapter No. 14, R. A. M., went to
Bowbells Wednesday where they
worked the degrees on two sets of
candidates, afternoon and evening.
The following comprised the degree
team: G. Roy Ringo, who acted as
High Priest C. F. Truax, Principal
Sojourner B. Stewart. Captain of the
Hosts A. D. Hagenstein, Royal Arch
Captain and W. H. Reighart and Carl
Jacobson, members of the Grand Coun­
cil.
A big banquet was served at 6 o'­
clock.
Wheat Grass Paid Dr. Nugent.
Dr. Nugent, the dentist, who has
demonstrated that he knows a thing or
two about the farming game, has dis­
posed of $1200 worth of wheat grass
seed at his farm southwest of Minot.
The doctor has been so successful with
this crop that hundreds of others will
sow large fields this year.

"SUNSET AND EVENING STAR."
In the passing of Colonel Alexander Scarlett at
the Saint Joseph's Hospital in Minot, North Dakota, on
May eighth, nineteen hundred sixteen, the state and
city in general and the Humane Society of Ward Coun­
ty in particular, suffered a loss of ivhich ivoivls must
fail in attempt to tell,—a loss the sorrow of which
years can not efface, nor time's fairest gift replace.
His memory shall aye be revered, not alone for his
noble mein—his humanitarian heart,—but for his
accomplishments in which self interests played but a
secondary part.
His state entrusted him with commissions capable
of being undertaken only by a man of vaster vision and
his accomplishments won him a place among the most
illustrious. As a patriot and a philanthropist memory
associates his efforts with those of America's most
zealous statesmen, past and present. Truly, he "read
his history in a Nation's eyes"
He was a man "diligent in business"—possessing
a rare acumen—stimulating commercial and industrial
progress by the application of his keen mind here—his
ready hand there. A superior man, full of the joy of
doing thigs,—doing them better, and carrying the
world closer to the goal toward ivhich all true progress
presses.
To have known him was to have known a man of
indelible life principles—a person of simple, child-like
religious faith,—a soul which sympathized with, be­
cause it grasped full well, the emotions of souls great
and small around it.
And so, with veneration and dignity,—the laurel
crown of seventy-three well spent years upon his brow,
his life closed, serene as a mellow sunset at the twilight
of a happy day. But the indominable spirit of a great
man, and good, shall stay with us, to inspire, to bless.
Verily, peoples yet unborn shall rise up and call him
Benefactor.
The State mourns,—the City mourns,—his widow
mourns,—the ivorld mourns,—and this Society mourns
in a personal way, the Governor who so long fathered
its enterprises and aided in its successes to "speak for
those who cannot speak for themselves."

HOUSE TWO NIGHTS—MAY 19
AND 20.
A great vaudeville show will be
given at the opera house May 19 and
20, under the auspices of Minot Coun­
cil 277 U. C. T., who will raise funds
for the entertainihent of the state
convention to be held in Minot June
8, 9 and 10.
There will be seven big acts and the
entertainment will be worth the
money. A number of local artists will
appear and there will be some extraor­
dinary good imported specialities. The
program will not be given out but when
the Minot Council has anything to do
with such an affair, it is sure to be a
howling success.
The seat sale will start at Taylor's
drug store May 15. Many tickets
have already been sold, everyone ap­
pearing more than willing to help out
a good cause.
Several rehearsals have already
been held and those who are "next"
say that some side-splitting stunts
will be given.
A North Dakota Product.
Mrs. J. E. Stevens, who has become
well known thruout the state in her
anti-tuberculosis fight, was in the city
Saturday interviewing our druggists
and placing orders for Climatic
Cream, manufactured by the Climatic
Cream Co., of Grand Forks. This is a
wonderfully fine cream adapted to the
needs of the western skin, contain­
ing no animal fats to promote the
growth of unsightly hair. Mrs. Alice
Nelson Page, of the Page Printery,
Grand Forks, is one of the organizers
of the company, which is doing a re­
markably fine business. Ask your
druggist for Climatic Cream.
Horse Drowned in Slough.
A horse owned by Wood & Wood,
who own a farm west of the city, was
drowned in a slough near the old Matt
Poos dump ground west of the city.
A hired man was driving to the city
and on account of the high water,
drove into the slough, not knowing
that it contained about ten feet of
water.
Towner Farmer Was In Wrong.
R. E. Taylor, a prominent horse
dealer, is in the city. Mr. Taylor is
a brother of W. C. Taylor, commis­
sioner of insurance. The brothers look
like twins and this fact has led to
many amusing incidents. W. C. Tay­
lor years ago published a newspaper
at Towner, living on a homestead
south of that place. R. E. Taylor vis­
ited Towner sometime ago and met
one of the editor's old friends. He re­
marked, "I used to know you when
you ran a newspaper here." Mr. Tay­
lor said he was mistaken. "Well, I
remember you well when you lived on
your homestead." Again Mr. Taylor
assured him he was in error. "Well,
I voted for you several times, any­
way." Again he was informed that
he had his wires crossed and he walk­
ed away in disgust.
Max Dimond Was Not the Man.
Margaret Keller, friend of M. C.
Williams, held to the federal court on
the charge of violating the Mann act,
has been released. She will remain
in the city, hoping to secure his free­
dom ultimately. The woman is un­
doubtedly infatuated with the man.
Williams is not a bad looking fellow.
He is said to be a Yale graduate and
is well connected fraternally. The
young girl, who accuses him, accom­
panied by her elder sister, will leave
today for St. Paul, her home. Wil­
liams will come before the grand jury
later, when some startling testimony
will come out.
An amusing incident occurred at the
hearing. Max Dimond, a tailor, had
been summoned to appear as a wit­
ness. The girl had mentioned that a
Mr. Dimond had called at her room,1
handing her four dollars, but when she
saw Max she declared that he was not
the man. Max grew rather excited,
and rising to his feet, gesticulating
wildly, declared, "I never seen them
two girls in my whole life. Honest, I
am not the man." The women sub
stantiated his story.
8300,000 Fire at Ellendale. I
The city of Ellendale, N. D., located
in Dickey county, was nearly wiped off
the map by afire which started in an
old livery barn Tuesday night. Fan
ned by a forty mile wind, the flames
swept the business section of the city,
burning 24 business houses and then
wiped out GO residences. The flames
then spread to the country district,
burning a number of farm homes and
barns. The loss is nearly $300,000,
with about $150,000 insurance. The
plant of the Dickey County Leader,1
published by Brother Goddard, was
destroyed.
The fire is believed to have been of
incendiary origin.
Sons of Norway Will Celebrate on
May 17th.
The Sons of Norway are planning
on holding a celebration in this city
the evening of May 17. A program
will be rendered at 8 o'clock that
night. Judge A. M. Christenson of
Bismarck, Halvor L. Halvorson, and
others, will speak. A good musical
program will be rendered.
The program will be followed by a
dance.
All Scandinavians and their friends
are invited to attend the exercises and
dance.
Attended State Medical Meeting.
Dr. A. D. McCannel, Dr. A. Carr
and Dr. L. H. Kermott of this city at­
tended the meeting of the state medi­
cal society at Devils Lake Wednesday
which is still in progress today.
Dr. McCannel read a paper before
the convention. Dr. Green of the Un­
iversity of Minnesota was present.
The papers and discussions following
were all very interesting.
The meeting is in charge of the
president of the association, Dr. V. H.
Stickney, of Dickinson.
Six Loads of Lumber With an Engine.
Adam Blocher was in the city Sat­
urday and hauled out six immense
loads of lumber from the Rogers lum­
ber yard to his home northeast of the
city, where he has a force of 12 car­
penters at work building a large new
house and barn. The six wagons with
an oil wagon were hauled thru the
streets with an engine, presenting an
unusual sight.
Seed Blown From the Ground.
In the vicinity of Harvey, the wheat
seed was blown from hundreds of
acres of land by the fierce winds of
the early portion of the week. Many
farmers will have to re-seed their en­
tire crop.
SUPT. WENDI MADE
A GOOD RECORD
O N S E I N E N E N
OF SCHOOLS SHOULD BE
RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSI­
TION, AND PROBABLY WILL
BE.
The announcement of W. D. Wendt
for the nomination for superintendent
of schools of Ward county, appears in
the Independent this week. Mr. Wendt
has held this office during the past
two years and while it is always a
pleasure for this paper to commend
officials for their work when they are
deserving of it, we find it difficult to
give expression to the esteem in
which Mr. Wendt is held by the people
of Ward county.
In the first place he is a tireless
worker, and then he knows how. He
has made a very courteous official and
under his supervision. the schools of
Ward county have been brot to a very
high standard. Mr. Wendt will, most
likely, be re-elected without opposi­
tion.
About 200 delegates attended the
sixth annual meeting of the Women's
Foreign Missionary society at Man

on the program came from Dickinson,
Bismarck, Steele, St. Paul, Minneapo­
lis, Jamestown and Mandan.

THE FLOOD A
IKING OF THE PAS!
WATER WILL SOON BE BACK
WITHIN BANKS OF THE
MOUSE—PEOPLE ARE MOVING
BACK TO THEIR HOMES.
The flood waters of the Mouse river
at this point are receding very rapid­
ly and it is expected that the river
will be back within its banks by the
early part of next week.
Many of the people who were driven
from their homes on the lower
grounds, v/ill be able to go back by
Saturday or Sunday and within a
short time, our city will go along in
the even tenor of its ways. Many will
find considerable to do when the wat­
er again takes its natural course.
There will be water to be pumped out
from basements foundation walls to
be repaired floors to be relaid and
sco-res of other things to be looked
after. But these things will all be at­
tended to in time and while the ag-.
gregate amount of damage has been
considerable, hundreds will find em­
ployment in making these repairs.
The city officials, including the effic­
ient superintendent of streets, John
Strommen, deserve much credit for
holding the flood out of many quarters
of the city. It isn't any too early to
plan now how future floods may be
avoided. It may be many years be­
fore another such spectacle will be
seen in Minot, but considering that
most of the trouble can be obviated
with a comparatively small expendi­
ture, it behooves the city to get busy
on some feasable plan at once.
SENATOR McCUMBER BACK
TO CONDUCT CAMPAIGN.
Fargo, N. D., May 5.—United States
Senator Porter J. McCumber has re­
turned to North Dakota to conduct his
campaign for re-election. He expects
to spend the time until the primaries
within the state, having paired on all
important questions likely to arise in
the next eight weeks.
Senator McCumber comes home
with the impression that "the drift
among Republicans in the East is to­
ward Hughes for President." He has
no doubt Hughes, if nominated, will
accept.
The senator believes Hughes' nomi­
nation would mean Republican victory
in the general election.
As to the German-American situa­
tion, Senator McCumber anticipates a
satisfactory agreement.
Wilson's message*to Congress, and
his note to Germany failed to afford
Germany an opportunity to determine
just what the United States demand­
ed, McCumber maintains.
