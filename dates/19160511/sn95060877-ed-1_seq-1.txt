VOLUME XLVL NUMBER 24.
(By B. F. Fly)
Col. French, of the 21st
U. S. Infantry, together with
three full companies of his
reeiment. will reach Yuma
from Vancouver. Wash., by
Mondav evening or Tuesday
morning, if there is no delay
enroute.
Within Drobablv 24 hours
after the arrival of these now
troops, companies A and D,
of the 12th infantry regiment
will entrain for Douglas,
where they will rejoin their
regiment, thus leaving Yuma
in the hands of an entirely
new set of soldiers.
Col. French is a veteran soldier,
and , said to be one of the most af
fable men in the United States army
today. The fact that he is a high
ranking officer and has been sent to
Yuma to make this "regimental head
quarters" should of itself be sufficient
inducement to awaken our entire citi
zenship to extend him and his loyal
soldier boys a most cordial welcome,
nor should anything be left undone
that is at all calculated to show that
we thoroughly appreciate his assign
ment in our midst. j
A committee representing the City ,
Council, with acting Mayor Moser at
their head, together with President A.
B. Ming and the Board of Directors of
the Commercial Club, and other in
fluential citizens, should by all means
meet the train and extend a hearty
welcome to the new comers.
In addition to that the committee
should at once proceed to ishow Col.
French every available place in and
near the city as a suitable place for
the soldiers to pitch their tents. Com
ing from the extreme north, .where it
is almost perpetual winter, to a cli
mate that is perpetual summer, wili
be very trying to the soldiers, and for
that reason the very best location can
not be too good for them, from a
health standpoint.
It has been suggested that Prison
Kill be thrown open to Col. French,
for here the boys would have a per
petual cooling breeze, and. the build--
ings can very quickly be converted
into comfortable sleeping quarters.
Mr. Moser, having this idea in view,
has already taken the matter up with
his aldermanic brothers, and they are
heartily in favor of it.
Mr. Sanguinetti, who occupies two
of the buildings as warehouses, is per
fectly willing to vacate in favor of
the soldiers, realizing that this will
be an ideal place for their home. It
is possible, that the Valley Seed Asso
ciation can also be induced to give up
the building they occupy, which then
would leave only the Cement company
as occupants of Prison hill. No
doubt arrangements can be perfected
to permit this company and the sol
diers to occupy the place jointly, with
out either hindering the other.

NEW YORK, May 12. Samuel S.
McClure, returning from Copenhagen
said the found the peace sentiment in
Germany and Austria was only inspir
ed by a desire to renew commerce.
The other nations are determined to
fight to a finish.
Hon. John Doan, title manager of
the Yuma Title Abstract and Trust
company, met with a narrow escape
from death shortly after two o'clock
this afternoon, when the bicycle on
which he was riding skidded under
Dr. ApJohn's automobile, on First
avenue at Third street.
An eye witness stated that Mr. Doan
was badly lacerated and hurt across
the shoulders and lay face downward
under the machine as it passed over
Mm. Mr. Doan, if at all unconcsious,
quickly recovered and would say
nothing.
Dr. ApJohn hastened the injured
man to the Yuma hospital, where it
vas reported by Dr. Ketcherside in
harge that apparently no bones were
broken. Mr. Doan is noted as, a very
gritty man, and he walked from the
automobile into the hospital, where
at 3::)0 the attendant stated that he
was resting easily. At this writing
it cannot be stated just how the acci
dent occurred, but evidently Mr. Doan,
who was returning from dinner, after
discovering the oncoming automobile,
tried to stop but too late to prevent
his bicycle skidding underneath.
The accident is deploi'able, and it
is sincerely hoped that no serious re
sults will follow. In any event, the
occurrance ought to have a deterent
effect on fast automobile riding, of
which Yuma, like every other city,
has an over-abundance.
To date Yuma has 'been remarkably
free from automobile accidents, due
to good driving in part, but no doubt
largely because kind Providence has
ever been on giinrd. Let's be careful
in turning corners. Let "Safety
First" be the watchwortkat all times.

YUMA, ARIZONA, THUR
(By B. F. Fly)
Patriotism was at fever
heat last night when Co. L,
of the Arizona State Militia,
assembled at the Southern
Pacific hotel to entrain for
Douglas.
The Ocotillo Club, under
the leadership of its presi
dent, Mrs. James S. Garvin,
had decorated the front o:
the hotel with huge Ameri
can flags, and to show their
motherly feelings for our
gallant soldier boys had pro
vided a light luncheon for
them, which was served by
the members of the club.
The newly arrived 21st
U. S. regimental band, which
is to be stationed here indefi
nitely, though it had put in
a strenuous day traveling to
Yuma from San Diego and
pitching tent, was on hand
to furnish patriotic music,
while the ever loyal Elksj
under the leadership of Ex
alted Ruler Frank Ming, who
met in a body and acted as
guard of honor as "our
boys" cheerfully swung, into
the midnight train bound for
the Mexican frontier, where
they are to do a soldier's
duty, regardless of what that
duty may be.
The crowd that assembled at the
depot was as large as any gathering
ever seen t at that point. Mothers,
fathers, sisters and brothers embraced
their loved ones in a fond good-bye,
and when the famous regimental band
struck up "The Soldier's Farewell"
tears trickled down the cheeks of the
assembled multitude.
It was pathetic in the extreme, and
yet every heart was so filled with the
real American enthusiasm that it was
indeed an inspiring sight, for this is

the first time Copany L has ever bden
called to the front to engage in actual
warfare, not necessarily against poor
old Mexico, but a war of extermina
r.ation against the bandit forces of
that unhappy country who recently
have committed so many murders and
ether crimes that patience has ceased
to be a virtue.
That "our boys" will give a good
account of themselves under the most
trying circumstances there can be no
.question of doubt. Lieut. Colonel
Donkersley, who accompanied the
boys, said just before leaving that he
had every reason to be proud of
Yuma's members of the state militia,
while Capt. Frank Hall declared no
state in the Union will be able to
show a better body of men. That he
was doubly proud was evidenced
when he received the flag for his
company presented by the Elks in a
patriotic speech by County Attorney
Colman. This flag will be carried into
the very thickest of the battle, should
it be unhappily the lot of our sol
diers to have to engage in battle.
In addition to this flag, the members
of the Ocotillo Club pinned a dainty
little American flag on the breast of
every one of the members of Co. L.

WASHINGTON, May 12
Secretary of War Baker
announced, after the cabinet
meeting today, that the Mex
ican policy remains unchang
ed; no new orders for militia
are contemplated. It is also
'indicated that no general in
tervention in Mexico is con
Jsidered; at least, not at the
'present time.
The failure of Scott, Funston and
Obregon to agree has merely shifted,
the. negotiations to diplomatic chan
nels; officials here thought that a
break in these negotiations has not
strained diplomatic relations.
Scott's report has been presented
to the cabinet. It is understood the
negotiations called for an unwritten
agreement to have co-operation along
the border. It is said that Carranza
is unwilling to. sign any formal agree
ment v. hick his opponents would con
strue as a surrender of sovereignty.
