TEXT—TIit-n said the king to Itta.l the
(tittlte. wherefore gu;-st thou also with

To got the setting of this text we
must read at least the first 23 verses
of the chapter In
which it is found.
./ It will bo seen

was driven from
j: | his place by the
rebellion under

were turning from
• | |fs bint, and bis pop-
3J ularity seemingly
was waning. Then it was that Rial
came to him with cheer and encour
agement.
Ittai’s Choice of David.
In the first place it was a proper
choice, for even though David was
driven out, he was still the rightful
king. Then again, it was a very en
thusiastic choice, as we see from verse
21. Ittai was in it for life or death.
And it was a deliberate choice. Ho
was aware of the difficulties, the pri
vations and the dangers he must share
with David. He was not blind to the
promise of -ease and safety and pos
sibie advantage to himself by making
another choice. And he had before
him the example and influence of
some of the leading men who were
forsaking David. Hut he had count
ed the cost and then deliberately and
with enthusiasm he threw himself on
David’s side. What a picture this
presents of what the Christians’ choice
should be in following the Lord.
Doubtless there are certain difficul
ties and privations, certain promises
of ease and advantage from the other
side. And there is surely seen the
example of many who turn aside. But
in spilo of this the proper choice for
the Christian is a deliberate and en
thusiastic choice of the i-ord whatever
the cost may be.
Ittai’s Consecration to David,
His consecration is seen in his sep
aration to David’s person. Where the
King was ho would bo and where the
king went he must go. But this in
volved a confession of David's pur
pose. Being found with David meaut
that what David wanted to do, be want
ed to do. It would bo plain to all,
friend and foe alike, what Ittai want
ed. And this in turn meant associa
tion with David's people. How strong
Hie church would be it all professing
Christians were found among the peo
ple of Christ, having the purpose of
Christ as their purpose and knowing
not only some of the promises of
Christ, but knowing too something
of the person of Christ. But so many
have their own purposes to follow and
work out Instead of the Lord s. So
many there are whose associations
are more often formed among the ene
mies rather than the friends of Christ.
Little is seen of true consecration
among them.
Ittai’s Compensation From David.
To read this wo must read I Sum.
18:1, 2. In tins passage we are told
that Ittai came to a place of
responsibility for David's work. Ho
became a leader among David's
friends. This put him into a place
of honor before David’s enemies. They
knew Ittai had been promoted and
henceforth they must reckon with
him in their warfare against David.
And this gave him a place in sharing
in David’s triumph when at last the
king came into his own. What an
Incentive for all Christians to step out
and away from the world with a con
secration to the Lord which would re
sult in each one having such a place
in the Lord’s service that would make
the enemy take note of them. And
in the filling of such a place there
will come at last the sharing of our
Lord’s triumph when, his foes being
made bis footstool, lie is seated and
reigning upon his throne.
Ittai’s Secret.
Each successful life has had at its
foundation some secret spring which
has supplied the continuing energy
to give that life success. In Ittai’s
case the secret was threefold. He had
a personal attachment to David which
never wavered when David came to
troublous times. He was ready with
personal sacrifice for David when the
usurper was on the throne and David
driven out. And finally there was per
sonal satisfaction with David even
when apparently David could give him
nothing but difficulties and dangers
while David’s rival could hold out the
promise of ease and safety. This
same threefold secret applied to the
life of any Christian in relation to
the Ixtrd will bring success of the
highest kind. There is in this fol
lowing the Lord, sacrifice and priva
tion, difficulty and danger in the pres
ent time, but in the end it will he
glory and honor, delight and Joy In
the presence of the Lord Jesus
Christ.

MEANT A LOT TO FATHER
Message That “Baby Has a New
Tooth" Set Him to Thoughts
of the Future.
“Baby has a new tooth,” came faint
ly over the wire. The mother laughed.
She added something, but the girl
clerk did not understand. The phone
did not work well.
‘Tlaby has a new tooth.” The news
went round the office. All the clerks
stopped to listen. They, too, laughed.
"liaby has a new tooth,’ announced
the girl clerk In the doorway of the
private office. She withdrew.
The chief laid down a paper. It was
covered with figures. Most of them

The table was littered with papers.
On another table were other papers;
these, too, were covered with figures

He wasn’t growing old, In fact he
was In the prime of life —Just old
enough to mix sober Judgment with
youthful energy and do things to count
In a hustling, bustling world of rapid
changes and big achievements —he felt
that his opportunity had come and
that he was going to, be a success.
Hut a streak of gray showed in his
hair —his wife had commented on It
only that morning—and there was so
much to do, far more, ho know now,
than his youth hud reckoned. He
looked out a window. The wind was
blowing; ho noticed that a weather
vane pointed northwest.
“Baby has a new tooth." With a
shock it came back to him. It was
his first born. He thought of the
child and he thought of Its mother.
Soon the baby would have twe rows
of teeth In his head; then he would
grow up aid, his mother's work fin
ished, ho, and in turn his son, and
his son, and all the generations after,
like he, the parent of them all, would
lay their little coral lives on his,
and In time the Island of his dreams
would rise above the ocean of igno
rance and fear and constitute in the
sunlight of truth a new and more
beautiful world than what he knew.

Many Are Four-Flushing.
There’s many a Broadwayite posing
as ready money who only has two
changes of raiment —on and off. Yet
the tailors here decree that a man
must spend SO,OOO per annum for sar
torial effects If he must pose as a gen
tleman. First he must have a cereal
suit of brocaded silk or velvet to
wear In the morning when he eats
his roasted sawdust. And then he
should have a suit for every occasion
after that. Here’s the’ dope for the
swell dresser —twelve sack suits, cut
aways, full evening clothes, dinner
coats, six or seven overcoats, attire
for riding, polo, yachting, golf, tennis,
a dozen or so fancy vests, In fact, a
suit or two or six or eight for each
and every occasion must bo included
In the wardrobe, and It can all be
done for the trilling sum of $3,000 a
year, or SIOO a week. It’s very sim
ple when one knows the system, the
molders of fashion say. Some of the
fellows who have a suit for every day
In the week, and that is the one they
are wearing, are thinking of establish
ing credit with their tailors and go to
It. The tailors then may alter the
aforementioned decree. —Now Y’ork

Astronomical Observatories.
Plans are on foot to erect an as
tronomical observatory on Volkollen,
one of the highest mountain summits
in Scandinavia. A citizen of Duluth,
Minn., .Mr. J. H. Darling, has under
taken to erect an observatory on one
of the public playgrounds in that city,
and to equip it with a nine-inch equa
torial refractor. Plans have been
drawn for an observatory In Toronto
to serve as headquarters of the Itoyal
Astronomical Society of Canada. The
building is to be erected in a public
park, and maintained by the Univer
sity of Toronto. The proposed equip
ment includes a 20-inch telescope. This
project Is at present in abeyance, on

Literary Centenaries.
The year 191 C will be a remarkable
one for anniversaries. First and fore
most is the Shakespeare centenary;
July 7th will mark the centenary of
the death of another of our greatest
dramatists, Richard Brinsley Sheri
dan, who died in the greatest poverty
but was accorded a magnificent fu
neral In Westminster abbey. Other
literary anniversaries are those ol
Charlotte Bronte, who was born In
1816, and Thomas Gray, the poet, who
first saw the light a century earlier
This year also witnesses the bun
dredth anniversary of the birth ol

Dog Caused Baby's Death.
The death of a ten-months-old child
at Birmingham. England, caused by a
chained dog, was investigated by the
coroner a few days ago. The two com
panions were left alone for a time, thf
baby secured in a chair and the doe
chained to the door close by. When
the baby’s mother returned she found
the little one tying on the floor stran
gled. The dog had apparently leaped
on the chair, probably in play, and la
his antics the chain had been passed
round the baby’s neck, gripping bin
tighter and tighter as the dog strug
gled for liberty. A verdict of “accl
dental death” was recorded.

tender-hearted, Industrious. Her sis
ter was just the reverse—complaining,
dissatisfied, eager for some good for
tune that would enable her to live
without labor. Natalie was a profi
cient musician with piano and violin,
and gave lessons, paying her grasping
married sister more than a fair sum
for board.
It was a week later when Kate
flashed in upon Natalie at the piano
In a feverish state of indignation and
excitement.
"Tho mean old hunks!” she scold
ed; "what do you think? I wrote the
lawyers of undo’s estate, demanding
to know what they had left you—”
"Oh, Kate!" remonstrated Natalie.
"I’ve got the reply,” and Kate waved
an open letter in her hand. "All he
has left you is that old clap trap of a
violin he doted over so.”
“Oh, Kate! Did he. Indeed?” cried
Natalie with sparkling eyes. "Why,
his prized Carero is priceless! It was
his most precious treasure. To think
that he would leave it to me!”
Kate flounced off, ridiculing tho ex
travagant delight of her sister over
"a piece of antiquated rubbish!” Na
talie fondly thought of the old man’s
delight in his favored instrument.
Often he had played to her, and ho
had even allowed her to handle the
old instrument, but tenderly, as though
It were an infant in arms. There was
a large intrinsic value to the instru
ment on account of its maker, age
and power of melodious expression.
Natalie, however, never thought of
soiling it, especially when the violin
duly arrived with a note from the
lawyers of the estate, saying that Mr.
Warren had expressed the hope the
cherished instrument would never go
out of the family.
There ensued a period of rare de
light for Natalie after that. Tho
sound of the violin made Kate angry
every time it struck her ear. There
was a little old vine-covered bower at
one end of the garden. Thither Na
talie would go, and for hours would
draw sweet plaintive melody from the
vibrant strings.
She was dreamily playing a ca
denza one lonely afternoon when she
looked up, startled. On the other side
of the low fence stood a young man,
raptly listening to the echoing strains.
His eyes were lit with devotion to art,
his lips trembled, his whole being
seemed permeated with the plaintive
yet thrilling appeal of tho old instru
ment.
"Oh,” he cried, forgetting that he
was a stranger; “the divine music!
That Instrument! It came surely from
one of the music masters. May I look
at it? May 1 hold it, to know that
for a moment at least that I have
had possession of the very soul of
ravishing melody?”
His flue, statuesque face inspired
Natalie with confidence. Site opened
the little garden gate. She welcomed
him as a brother in art. He took up
the violin with an air of rare devo
tion and reverence. Then he began to
play. Natalie sat fascinated. He was
a master in his line.
After that ho came often to the quiet
rendezvous. Ho was a member of a
local orchestra, he told her; his life
was devoted to ono devouring theme
—music. Their preferences wore iden
tical, they grew to ho friends. One
day Victor Dalzell came to Natalie in
a state of great trepidation.
"Oil, Miss Prescott," he said anxious
ly. "I have a great favor to ask!
They have placed me on a program
for a violin solo at the groat symphony
concert. Tito leader says it will set
tle my admission to his circle at high
compensation. Oh, if I had only the
Carero for a single fifteen mipules—
the great, glorious Carero —1 know I
should succeed!”
She regarded him with a tender
light in her eyes.
"You will be very careful of the in
strument?” she said.
“1 will guard it with my life!" cried
the delighted enthusiast. “Oh, how
can 1 ever repay you? And with your
presence at the concert, 1 will bring
the very soul out of the violin!"
Natalie sat entranced when Victor,
el the concert, began ids solo number.
All about her tense, strained faces told
of the general effect of the beautiful
music. The gifted player was given
an ovation, and the pleased face of
the orchestra loader told that the for
tune of the young violinist was as
sured.
Natalie had gone to the waiting
room when the program was finished.
Victor was to Join her there and ac
company iter homo. Suddenly a
scream startled her. The next instant,
followed by excited members of the
orchestra, the young musician reeled
into the room with bloodless face and
staring eyes.
"The Carero!" he shrieked. "It Is
stolen!" and fell senseless at her feet.
A doctor was summoned. He looked
grave as he felt the pulse and opened
the eyelid of the Insensible young
musician.
"Got him to a hospital at once!”
he ordered, "it the strain he is under
is not soon relieved ho will lose his
mind.”
Natalie hoard the others tell of how
Victor had left the violin unguarded
for a moment, to find it gone five
minutes later. Site sat softly crying
to herself. Natalie was about to pro
ceed slowly home when the lender of
the orchestra appeared hurriedly.
“Y’ou are the young lady to whom
the Carero belongs," lie said. “It is
found. It seems that the caretaker
locked it up for safety, has just re
turned and found it ”
"Oh, I must hasten to the hospital
at once!” fluttered Natalie. A nurse
led her to a room where Victor sat,
muttering to himself incoherently:
“The Carero! The Carero!”
"Mr. Dal/.0ll —Victor," spoke Natalie
tremblingly, “we have found the Ca
rero. See, it is here," but ho never
even looked up.
“May 1 try an experiment?” faltered
Natalio, and, the nurse assenting, she
removed the violin from its case. Na
talie began playing the masterpiece of
the concert as best she could.
Victor started at the first melodious
note. His eyes lost their moody ex
pression. A rare ecstacy came into
his face—reason was recalled by the
marvelous magic!
The Carero brought distinction and
wealth to Victor, and love, marriage
and happiness to both these talented
children of art.
Health Benefit of Yawning.
Yawning is said to have an exceed
ingly healthful function besides hav
ing a salutary effect in complaints of
the pharynx and the eustachian tubes.
According to investigations yawning
Is the most natural form of respira
tory exercise, bringing Into action all
the respiratory muscles of the neck
and chest. It is recommended that
every person should have a good yawn
with the stretching of the limbs morn
ing and evening for the purpose of
ventilating the lungs and tonifying the
respiratory muscles.
An emincmt authority asserts that
this form of gymnastics has a remark
able effect in relieving throat and ear
troubles, and says that patients suf
fering from disorders of the throat
have derived groat benefit from it. He
says he makes his patients yawn, by
suggestion or imitation, or by a series
of deep breaths with the lips partly
closed.
The yawning is repeated six or sev
en times, and should be followed by
swallowing. By this process the air
and mucus in the eustachian tubes are
aspirated.
Rather Arduous.
“There isn’t much glamor In mod
ern war.”
"That’s true. I understand some
of the society girls who became
nurses have discovered that hospital
work is considerably harder than fox
trotting.”
Not in Existence Then.
“That idea of a ‘Don’t Worry Cluo
is a wonderful thing.”
"Yes,” replied Miss Cayenne. "But
I’m rather glad it didn’t have much
vogue when George Washington and
his associates were discussing our
foreign relations.”
FORTUNATE OF EARTH
ARE THOSE WITH WHOM CHIL
DREN ARE CONFIDENTIAL.
°robably the Most Precious Gift That
the Fairies Bestow and It Is Not
Given to the Majority of
Mankind.
It is very likely a fairy gift, and if
you haven’t ii there is little hope of
your ever getting it. if you have it,
however, you are the most fortunate
sort of all sorts of fortunate folks.
You are the sort that the children talk
to in the street. And the reason that
the person the children talk to in the
street is so very fortunate is that
they tell him things that nobody else
ever hears, and very good things to
hoar, fit that. From that fact it. is
easy to understand that this talk of
theirs is no more "good morning” or
"hello” sort of conversation. It is real
talk about real things, although, to bo
sure, it is only the fortunate person
who hears it that can really under
stand it.
They begin very abruptly, these chil
dren, and the beginning may ho in the
middle or nt either end of a tiling.
It does not matter. The talk may
start something like this, entirely un
expected or unsolicited on tho fortu
nate person’s part; "You’d think
they'd fall out anyway, if you did think
anybody growed on the moon, wouldn’t
you?" And it may lead anywhere.
Sometimes it is much more personal
than that. You may meet a small boy
armed with a toy gun and a sword and
he may begin, "You'll have to run for
it,” meaning the street car, “but if
you ain’t got any better luck than me
you'll miss it anyway. I bet I got the
w T orst luck of anybody, and I bet I’ve
found tile most horse shoes. If I had
good luck I'd been a girl and then I
wouldn’t have to fight all tho time.”
And this is probably from the terror
of his neighborhood, a hoy who is
supposed by teachers and neighbors
and parents, to exist solely for the
joy of battle.
If you are the fortunate sort of per
son, you will be stopped and consulted
about, everything the children are do
ing. It may ho cold and almost dark,
and you may lie hurrying home to sup
per, but if you are the right one. the
little girl who is contemplating tho
snow woman, a plump stylish creature
with full skirts and a hat with a feath
er, will call to you without a doubt of
your sympathy, to know whether or
not you don’t think "she is just a lit
tle cross-eyed,”
"It’s the newsboy's fault,” she ex
plains, "lie poked her in the eye and it
ain’t been right since. I could take a
couple of buttons off her waist, they’re
only walnuts, and make her some oth
er eyes just to match, hut she is get
ting so slippy.”
They may run after you to tell you
a bit of gossip about their "friends,”
imaginary friends that nobody else
ever heard of. They may trot along
with you repeating the most astonish
ing conversations that they have had
with squirrels or bears or stars or
policemen. And it is all true. It is
ail because they believe it. and it is
tho expression of their queer little
selves.
Justice, Then Prosperity.
The difference between the men in
office now in city, In state and in fed
eral government, and those men in
office 20 years ago, in those rather
narrow hut controlling areas of our
politics where there are actually
marked differences, lies not In mat
ters of honesty, not in matters of ca
pacity. not in matters of party faith.
The real difference is found in their
philosophy of life, William Allen
White writes in the New York Inde
pendent. The political leaders of ma
jorities in the eighties and nineties
of the last century believed in busi
ness for Itself, that prosperity was an
end of itself. Today our governments,
city, state and national, are more or
less tinder the control of men who all
profess, and who in tho main b< lieve
that justice is more Important than
prosperity. And the politicians are
only taking their cure from the peo
ple. A sense of justice—with h- ro a
backset, and there a reaction —is
growing steadily and overwhelm ngly
In the American heart.
Zeppelins Built Since the War.
According to a dispatch from Berne,
Switzerland, there are now some
eighty Zeppelins in the German
service. This statement, is said to
be based on information developed at
Friedrichshafen, where the ai.ship
works are located. Recently one of
the latest type Zeppelins made a trial
flight. It bore tho number LZ-95, and
in design varied considerably from tho
ante-bellum Zeppelins. Its gondolas
are said to be of plated steel. The
craft is plentifully supplied with ma
chine guns and apparatus for throw
ing bombs and aerial torpedoes:
among the latter being a new type
which is reported to be far more pow
erful then any heretofore developed.
In fact, rumor has It that the new
aerial torpedo Is to play a prominent
part in the event of the German war
ships and Zeppelins coming out from 1
their sheltering harbors and engaging
in battle with the British (loot in the

I NEVER LEARNED THE TRUTH
| Callow Youngsters Might Have Re
pented of Their Condemnation If
They Had but Known.
j Youth and presumably Innocence
i wcro waiting at a French goods coun
-1 ter while the dork wrapped up jars of
| pink stuff which they didn’t need.
' Each was audacious in the matter of
short skirts, and both were chewing
1 gum.
On a stool at the same counter sat
another customer, a woman just facing
the agony line which separates beauty
from vandal Age. And Youth and In
nocence felt called on to dissect her.
1 They bandied impressions as to the
\ woman's looks, and giggled over her
desperate attempts to retain her com
plexion and age. Their sharp young
eyes took in the nobby dress that was
! almost shabby, and their sharp young
voices would have stabbed her to the
quick except that she seemed to bo
walled in by some concentrated
thought that cloistered her from their
blows.
"1 hetshees bad.”
Tlio gum-stuck verdict came from
Innocence, whose lawful place at that
minute should have been in some
eighth-grade schoolroom.
‘T'ccorse. Anybodyk'n tell that.
Whodjespose would lookatarole mut
liko her?”
Then Youth and Innocence, without
explaining how they came to be so
sordidly enlightened at their callow
years, suddenly switched interest to
their stuff, and— That
was all there was to it.
Except that the woman, having
bought and paid for her own little box
of something, got up and hurried to the
store entrance, where another woman
stopped to congratulate her on some
appointment obtained by her son:
’ Isn't it splendid! Pupa and I are
so proud of him—l'm especially glad
for papa, because he has been so de
pressed ever since his last attack—
Ned s going to send him to Atlantic
City right away— Imagine! After
all these poverty-pinched days— ’’
"Wen, you surely deserve all the
good luck that's coming to you— Don’t
see how on earth you keep your color
after all the nursing you've had to
do —”
"Rouge, my dear. Papa'd be too
wretched for words If he knew my
complexion had gone yellow—but Ned
says I shan’t need it after this—”
This isn't much of a yarti, of course,
but we have Plutarch’s word for It that
truth Is always worth considering.
And this is true.—Washington Star.
Scientists Study “Flying Sickness."
“Flying sickness” in its more essen
tia! particulars Is deserving of care
ful and scientific investigation, ac
cording to the London Lancet. It
raises matters of interest In connec
tion with so-called mountain sickness.
Edward Whymper states from his own
experience of this condition that the
abiding symptoms are profound lassi
tude, Intense headache, feverishness,
accelerated respiration and occasional
spasmodic gulping of air, “just like
the fishes when taken out of water,"
palpitation and tinnitus. The latter
two symptoms, no doubt, occur also
with groat frequency at relatively low
levels.
"It is clear,” says the Lancet, “that
flying sickness is not comparable In
the strict sense with mountain sick
ness. in spite of the fact that some
of the symptoms are more or less
identical. Hitherto we have had little
direct evidence of what occurs as a
result of rapid transference from high
to low altitudes, for the laborious as
cent of the mountaineer into rarlfled
air is very different from a speedy re
turn to normal pressures, while the
climb of a flying machine Is hardly so
rapid as to cause any 111 effect. The
pilot who is lifted from his machine,
after a fast volplane, In a semicon
scious condition, falling thereafter
into a deep sleep, shows a phenome
non not met with either in mountain
sickness or In caisson diseased*
To Promote Safety.
The newest museum In New York la
called the American Museum of Safe
ty. It contains collections of models,
charts and photographs, actual ma
chines safeguarded in full size, to
gether with models of safety devices
and sanitary appliances. The mu
seum is free to the public. By special
arrangement it is open In the eve
nings to classes and societies. The
activities of the museum of safety are
devoted to the safety, health and wel
fare of industrial workers and the ad
vancement of the science of Industry.
The society gives yearly medals to
those which make notable achieve
ments in devices for the security of
human life, and to firms that make
notable progress In the promotion of
hvgicnc and the mitigation of occu
pational disease in their industry, and
to railroads that promote safety for
the traveling public.
Japanese Turn to Dye Making.
The Japanese are apparently going
to take up dye making, now that Ger
man products cannot be obtained and
the plan has been taken up by private
enterprise, assisted by government. A
number of business men were invited
to the department of agriculture and
commerce one day lately and shown
the draft law for the encouragement
jf the manufacture of drugs and dye
stuffs. The vice-minister of agricul
ture and eornmerco reported particu
lars regarding the encouragement law,
and invited those present to give their
views, without reserve, regarding the
establishment of a company. It was
susbscqucntly decided that those pres
ent should consider the matter, and
give their views later.
