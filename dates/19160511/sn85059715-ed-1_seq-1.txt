H?* also served his school while at
the University of Michigan as Its
representative In an Inter-collegiate
debate.
?Mr. Strother was admitted to the
bar of this county in 1911. Since
that time he has given his undivided
attention to the practice of his pro
fession and has won for himself a
reputation among the members of his
profession and the public at large,
of being a man of integrity and good
judgment, with a profound knowl
edge of the law. Here is a man with
a scientific education as well as a
legal one, a man of broad intellectu
al attainments, a man well versed in
the practical branches of knowledge,
a man with a well-trained mind, who
is able to look at a question from
all points of view, In an unbiased and
non-partisan manner, and this is the
man who is now before the Republi
can voters of Harrison county, asking
their support In the coming primary
election for the nomination of pros
ecutlng attorney.
The office of, thl* prosecuting at
torney is one of groat Importance to
the people and to the state. This
Ih an olBce of the stato to protect the
interests of the state and in doing
this, the interests of the people. The
man who tills this office is hound by
his oath to uphold the laws of the:
state, the laws placed on the statute]
hooka of the state by the people to
protect themselves and their hoinea
and property. But the man who fills
this office of responsibility must also!
have ever before him the fact that he !
is an officer of the people as well as

see that the laws of the state madej
by the people, are enforced with Jus- j
tice to all. The man who fills this

devotion to his profession for tho

laws of God and man. Ho has been
prompt and fearless in the support!
of every Just cause and has taken an
actlvo interest in all charities and
religious movements. He is a sin
cere member of the Methodist Epis
copal church.
It is .the conviction of his friends
and supporters that Ray L. Strother
would meet all tho requirements of
the office and would fill the same to
the satisfaction of tho people and
with credit to himself, and that he i
is the candidate for the Republican!
voters of Harrison county to work
for and vote for, believing that he <s
the man best fitted to make the
fight before the people In the Novem
ber election for prosecuting attorney
