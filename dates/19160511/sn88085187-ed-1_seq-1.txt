"Woof! Woof! and he harked in doggish glee.
"Poof! Poof! said the bulldog to the poodle,
"You're an ee-cen-tri-ci-teel"

Did he beat it? He did not! Nay, he slew him

STUPIDITY!
IF NOT THAT
IT'S WORSE
Editor's Note: Yesterday The Times printed au exclu
sive story from Washington telling how tJie U. S. aimy ord
nance hoard some time ago rejected the Lewis machine gun
when it was offered free to the government by its Inventor.
This gun is the one which In the European war lik» been proved
the greatest small-arm Invention in the world. The following
article sets forth some further iimu-ing tacts in re..;urd to this
gigantic blunder ami suggests one possible reiisou why it was
romtuited.
WASHINGTON, I). C, May 11.
— Col. Lewis learned his lesson
when Oh, Crozier and his asso
ciates took the attitude his great
invention had failed.
He had learned that an army
officer's Invention would not re
ceive far-sighted, constructive at
tention from the hoard of ord
nance, unless perchanre he stood
In with the members of the board.
LEWIS DID NOT STAND IN.
He had repeatedly criticised
the disappearing gun carriage
which Gen. Crozier has foisted
upon our coast defenses.
He had written a report to
Secretary of War Boot scathingly
condemning the ordnance equip
ment with which our boys were
sent to the Philippines ■-■and the
rebound from this report HIT
THE BOARD HARD.
Lewis moreover had made the
board eat crow in the matter of
his depression range finder.
In 1889 Lewis got the basic pat
ents on range finders, and of
fered his remarkable invention
free to the United States.
Our ordnance authorities look
ed the other way.
THEY weren't interested in
new-fangled inventions by THIS
ENTHUSIAST LEWIS. When the
Spanish-American war broke out
we had no satisfactory range
finders, and we hud to purchase at
great cost from the private con
cern to which Col. Lewis had
turned over his rights in the in
vention THE VERY RANGE
FINDER which we had refused
when it was offered io us FOR
NOTHING!
Again. in 11)00, Col.
I-evvis succeeded in bringing
hack from Europe the secret
plans of the new French 75,
now so famous, of which the
distinctive feature was that
the gun recoiled separately
from the currtuge.
It was a vastly significant
advance in ordnance con
struction. Lewis was SNUB
BED for his pulns, though
again authorities had to
COME ROUND ULTIMATE
LY to this 1 \ pc of gun!
With this experience of unfair
treatment behind him, Lewis
finally gave up pressing his ma
chine gun on the United States
which preferred the kind that
jam.
THE LEWIS GUN CANNOT
JAM.
Belgian financiers realized Its
merits and raised 1700,000 to be
gin making it. Then the Birming
ham Arms Co. of England took it
over, and Just before the present
war broke out sold the first con
signment to Russia.
Those guns wore on the last
train that raced through Germany
before the war dosed the fron
tiers!
Great Britain at once con
tracted for the ENTIRE output of
the Birmingham Arms Co.
Canada bought the entire out
put of the Savage Arms Co.,
which had acquired the American
rights.
Twenty-five hundred Lewie
guns were bought by popular sub
scription In Canada.
At least '.v..00n Lewis
guns are In use in Europe
today.
Their exploits have proved
them the master machine
guns of the war.
They are the only type
even considered by «-Treat
Britain for her aerial fight
ers.
France has watched their
success, and Is now equip
ping two factories, on* at
Paris and oue at Bt. I* lienor,
to manufacture them.

Two Lewis machine guns, one
of British, one of American make,
are now being tested again at the
Springfield arsenal by a board of
officers.
It took weeks of correspondence
and the official consent of the
British government before the
Cnited States could get these two
mere TEST I) pcs of a gun Invent
ed by an officer of our own army!
Secrecy beclouds the present
test.
Whother it results In the adop

Lewis gun is not now important.
The important question is, will
the ordnance bureau continue to
treat American inventors as it
has treated Co). Lewis?

Small settlements are preparing

Authorities believed that the

Mexican on the American side Is
under suspicion. Even those who
heretofore have been friendly are
distrusted now.
