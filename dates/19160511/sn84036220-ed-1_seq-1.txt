Tlie course of General Obregon at

Mexican war minister might be seek
iug political benefit, from the tactics
lie has adopted. There is no official
information tending to supiiort this
view, although intimations of friction
between Carranaza and his war minis
ter iiave been published frequently
manipulation of this sort, if it does
not exist, will be prolonged to the
point of causing a break with the
United States. A feeling of optimism
as to the final result of the conference
is based largely upon this view and
also upon the fact that General Scott
has given no indication that he
thought an agreement could not be
reached. Secretary Baker said the de
ing a common ground on which the
conferees could agree.
Some of the additional troops or
dered to the border yesterday were
presumed to be enroute tonight The
war department had received no di
rect reports from the various regular
commanders, although many routine
messages dealing with the movements
came up today. Mobilization of the
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas na
tional guard troops was proceeding
under state authority until the forces
could be formally mustered into the
federal service.
Probably 8,000 additional regulars
for border work could be drawn from
the coast artillery posts should tho
need arise. There were 111,000 men
of the corps in continental United
States at tlie time of the last report.
NO PROGRESS MADE.

General Obregon awaited word from
