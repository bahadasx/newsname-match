"Good Music Only" on New
York Philharmonic Programs.
The late Algernon St. John
Bernon, music critic of the New
York Morning Telegraph, in writ
ing about Josef Stransky, con
ductor of the New York Philhar
monic Orchertra, which will ap
pear May 17, in Chattanooga said :
t U f L!L 1 1 . .. " V . I. .v
uxr. cjti.nati.iy uaa uiw ay a wen
happy in his programmes.
He has no fads or whims,and he
lias shown an inclination to avoid
tedious and 'bloodsinnige' novel
ties. .
"Knowing that the bitter feel
ings of the war have reflected
themselves in distortion m the
attitude of audiences to the mus
ic of this nation and of that f and
hearing that a man of the emi
nence of Saint-Saens found it in
hia artiste conscience to belittle
the dead Wagner because of the
living Kaiser, Mr. Stransky ex
pressed himself manfully on the
whole subject of nationalism in
music and parochialism in pro
grammes at the first meeting of
the Philharmonic this season.
"Mr. Stanskv said to the musi
cians: "Art is international. We are
here to give bestendeavers to the
cause of musicial art and the only
distinction I make is between
good and bad music, irrespective
of its "Nationality." We will
jierform good music only, from
whatever source it may come.
Our programmes will contain a
wealth of works, old and modern
revivals and first performances
products of the genius of all nat
ions. There shall not be the
slightest preference. These
works will receive production be
cause they are worth presenting
to Philharmonic audiences, which
rank among the best musically
educated and appreciative and
may certainly be considered the
most international and Cosmopo
litan.' "These are admirable words,
and they are also the only words
to be spoken on the conditions.
It is not easy to find the only
words."
Perfect Man.
There is a man who never said
A word that was unkind;
He'd never see a thing abused
Or hear a friend maligned ;
He's deaf, dumb and blind.
There is a man who never drinks,
Nor smokes, nor chews, nor swears
Who never gambles, never flirts;
And shuns all sinful snares,
He's paralyzed.
There is a man who never does
A thing that is not right;
His wife can tell just where he is
At morning, noon or night;
He's dead.

"The very first bottle of Tan
lac I took made me feel so much
stronger and better that I com
menced doing some of my house
hold work ; I just keep right on
working and taking Tanlac un
til I now feel perfectly well and
am doing all my work, even to
my gardening," said Mrs. D.
Herrington, who lives at 1232
Fourth Avenue, Nashville, to the
Tanlac representative who call
ed for her statement a few days
ago and found her working her
attractive new garden.
"Yes, sir," continued Mrs.
Herrington. "I have gained
fourteen pounds and have im-,
proved so much since taking Tan
lac that my father and mother
hardly knew me .when I went to
see them the other day. I act
ually believe Tanlac saved my
life, and my husband does, too. !
"I had pecular pains in my side
and stomach for four years, and
the doctor didn't seem to know
the cause of my trouble. One of
- 1 s-t an ill t t 1 . . 1 ir a An r - 1
my husband1 spent four or live
hundred dollars for mdicine and
doctor's bills, and nothing seem
ed to do me any good. I fell off
until I only weighed 98 pounds,
and was so weak that I couldn't
do any work at all. I was so
nervous that I couldn't hardly go
to, sleep, and what I did sleep
was just 'cat naps;' and I would
get up in the mornings so tired
that I could hardly drag myself
around. I had no appetite, and
couldn't eat meats at all without
having awful pains in , my
stomach. The cramping pains
in my right side were something
terrible. My kidneys troubled
me a great deal, and I had hefavy
aching pains in my back lot3 of
the time.
"My husband told me he be
lieved Tanlac would help me,
and said he wanted me to try it,
and I'm so glad I did, for it hast
almost made a new woman 6f me.

worn out, I feel strong and full of

out of a dreadful shape and made

I did if they will only give it a
trial."
