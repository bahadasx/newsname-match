Chesterfield Honors
Her Heroic Dead
According to a time honored
and beautiful custom, Chesterfield
turned aside from her business
occupations yesterday to do
honor to the memory of those
brave and gallant soldiers who
have answered the last roll call
fcnd are sleeping in the ChesterHeld
cemetery.
The school children bearing
lowers, formed ranks at the
sourthouse and together with
die few remaining veterans and
litnens inarched to the cemetery.
Oapt. H. D. Tiller was master
>f ceremonies.
At the cemetery the exercisee
vere simple but impressive
tiev. J. L. Tyler led in prayer.
L'here was music by a select
shoir and an excellent address
iy Mr. P, A. Murray, Jr. Mr.
Murray spoke of the the Old
South and the New, paying a
ice tribute to those of the old
lout.h who fought for a pricipal.
There were only five veterans

A Pear Blight Cure
About one year ago The Advertiser's
representative found
,he farm of Mr. A. A. Douglass,
>n the did Scotch Koad, an investing
place to visit. At that
;irce Mr. Douglass told an interring
story of a snake that swalowed
alcohol, bottle and all.
de showed us some live guineaihickens
(a hybrid) and a number
of useful inventions. This
<ime there was no story to relate
uul the guinea-chickens had
jrown up and were sold.
Mr. Douglass' wizardy had
iaken a new turn, and he show?d
us some pear trees that had
seen cured of pear blight. The
irees showed every evidence of
saving suffered from some disjase,
but the bark and wood are
low in a healthy condition. A
reliable witness was not wanting

badly last year, but were
now apparently sound.
This preparation was applied
last year to a single row of peas
in a field that was affected by
wilt, with the result that the
jne row produced thoroughly
nealthy vines, while other parts
>f the field continued to suffer.
Mr. Douglass believes his disjovery
will prove an effective
remedy for cotton wilt, tomato
rot and other kindred vegetable
lilments, as it has -1 so arrested
cabbage rot.
More thorough tests will no
doubt be given this preparation
ihis summer.
Two Fugitives Caught

were captured by Chesterfield

About two months ago these
two boys, in company with a
Davis boy, known in Chesterfield,
were charged with unlawfully
entering a box car in
Mecklenburg county.) The Davis
boy was sent to the reformatory
while Keenan and Blanehard
were sent to the gang for
Bix months. Their claim is that
they only entered the car for
protection from cold.
Word had been received at
the sheriff's office to look out for
them and when two strangers
came strolling through town corresponding
to their descriptions
Mr. Grant, rural policeman, took
up the trail and soon had both
boys in custody.

Jim Teal's Family
Destitute in Columtra 1
The family of Mr. Jim Teal, |
whose condition had been called fc?
to the attention of the county au- f
i thorities, left the county last
week for Columbia. Mr. Teal \
i had been release from the State
Sanitarium and thought himself
able to support his family in Columbia
The city authorities
have taken the family in custody
pending action by the State J
Board of Charities.
The following letter has just,
been received: ,1
Rev. J. L. Tyler,
Chesterfield. .S. (!.
Dear Mr. Tyler : The assocciated
Charities has asked us
to assist them in placing the
seven children of Mr. Teal of
Chesterfield, S. C. Mr. Teal
was dismissed from the State
Hospital for the Insane a few
days ago. His type of mental
trouble, the director of the medio'
falT at the State Hospital
im . j me, is such that it may
be some months and even years
before he will have to be recommitted.
He has been a patient
at the State Hospital on
three separate occasions, as his
trouble has recurred at intervals
after he was dismissed. The
medical director tells me that
if he can be relieved of the burden
of caring for his seven childdren
it may have a tendency to
prolong the period during which
he will be sane.
You wrote Miss Blackburn of
the Associated Charities that
you had been authorized by the
Chesterfield board of county
commissioners to place these
children in an orphanage. Have
you any special orphanuge in
mind? It will cost the coun ty
$o.OO a month to keep each
child in the the llescue Orphanage
at Columbia. There are
seven of these children, you
know. Can you tell me how
much money the board of commissioners
of your county is
willing to pay for their support?
Please do not let the idea get
out that Mr. Teal has been parolled
from the State Hospital for
the Insane while he was insane.
This is not the case, but as I
said before his mental trouble
is liable to recur at any time.
Taking these children and putting
them where he will not be
burdened with their support
will have a tendency to prolong
the period between the attacks
..: ~ - i l 1 i -
I hi mn iiit-utai tniuuiu.
1 hope we may be able to
make some satisfactory arrangement
about these children.
Have they any relatives at all
in Chesterfield county who
could assist in taking care of
them?
With kindest regards, 1 am,
Yours truly,
Albert D. Oliphant,
Assistant Secretary.
It will no doubt appear to
everyone that this is still a
Chesterfield county case and
that ChesterfL'hl county should
act.
It has been suggested that
the county entor five of the
children in the Columbia home
and maintain them there for a
few months until satisfactory
homes can be found for them.
The Texas State Pure Food
.1 F \ T \ x - t
ami i/rug i?eparinieni. Having
made independent expeiiments
which proved beyond doubt
that flies carry disease germs,
has begun an active campaign
for the screening of all foodstuffs
in the state. Inspectors
have been sent out with strict
orders to compel all storekeepers,
hucksters and others who
offer anything edible for sale to
keep it covered in snch a mannor
that flies cannot get to it. In
most of the cities the women's
clubs are giving active aid to the
inspectors and promising to
withdraw their trade from tncr\chants
who persist in violating
11this law.
