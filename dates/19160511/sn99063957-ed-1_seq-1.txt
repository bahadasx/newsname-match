Port San Luis, Cal., May
the breakers today lor bodies of. the 47 believed dead in
the North Pacific liner Roanoke disaster, a wireless mes
sage came from the steamer
gone over the scene of the horror off Point Buchon and
found no trace of survivors. This radio was received at
9:30 a. m. by J. H. Sims, president of the Pacific Coast
Railway. It also announced
in and would arrive at 11 o clock.
Rumors along the sea-coast that another lifeboat con
taining a single corpse had been found, were not sub
stantiated and were discredited. So far the only men
known to have escaped death are Joseph F. Erbe, a
quartermaster, and two Mexicans who drifted ashore
with five dead bodies in a lifeboat near here last night.
Accounts of the end of Captain Richard Dickson and
his wife conflict. The only man able to give a half way
coherent report of the disaster so far is Erbe. He now
says that when his lifeboat pulled away from the doomed
Roanoke after its cargo had shifted and thrown it on its
beam ends, both the captain and his wife were clinging
to the bridge.
The two Mexicans are suffering so from shock that
they are not able to talk.
In a later statement Erbe said that two lifeboats were
swamped in leaving the sinking ship. One having arrived
here, this leaves two unaccounted for.
The steam schooner Whittier arrived here today and
reported having seen no trace of the Roanoke or its life
boats. A heavy gale is blowing which might make it im
possible for small boats to keep afloat.
Manuel Lopez, fireman, who came
ashore in the lifeboat with Quarter
master bill) and Charles Rouerio, told
a graphic story of the disaster this aft
ernoon when he had partially recovered
from the shock.
He declared that the crew of the
Roanoke was inexperienced and that
in his opinion the cargo was badly load
ed. He declared he protested tq Cap
tain Dickson and begged the skipper
in t to take his wife on the voyage.
Tie steamer's destination, Lopez paid,
was not known to him.
Contrary to statements that the liner
suddenly rolled over when hit by a big
wave, Lopez asserted that it began to
list heavily several hours before it fin
ally sank.
When the steamer began to tip over,
mi attempt was made to summon help
by wireless, but tho radio was found
to be out of commission. Signals were
tli "ii hoisfed, but three ships which
li.if-M'd did not see them.
Bouts Cnuglit In Davits.
Finally, according to Lopez, prepara
tions were made to tuke to the lite
boa Is. There were, he said, "about
fid or fiO" persons aboard and if the
lifeboats had been properly handled
Lopez said he believes that" all 12 of
them could have been launched. How
ever, several caught in the davits or
were capsized. Five n-ere finally float
ed, but two of these swamped.
In one of the boats still missing Lopez
enid there was only one man, John D.

11. While patrols watched
Lansing saying that it had
that the Lansing was coming
Dennis, the second officer, who climbed
into it alone. There are eight men
in the other missing lifeboat.
Quartermaster Lib recovered suffici
ently this afternoon to add more to his
narrative of the disaster. He said that
the boat which he first entered was
swamped on account of poor handling.
Hurled into the water, lie swam to a
floating plank and clung to it until he
wus picked up by the craft containing
Lopez.
In this they attempted to row ashore.
There, were eight aboard when tho start
was made. Three died Tuesday night,
and were left in the boat. One more
died Wednesday afternoon, and the
third died just as the party reached
the Port Sun Luis breakwater.
Two of tho dead men have been iden
tified as Jesus A'arela and J. L. Leslie.
A third corpse had the initinls "C. F. "
on the clothing. Charles Fennor. aged
22, an oiler, was among the lost, and
this may be his body.
Earlier Story of Wreck
Port San Luis. Cal., May 11. Four
lifbonts containing possible survivors
of the disaster to the steamer Ro.uioke
may be drifting in a rough sen far off
Point J'uchon today. The lioanoke with
a cargo of explosives sank about !1 p.
m. Tuesday, when a huge wave tilted
the vessel on its beam ends and shift
ed tho tons of goods in the hold. Forty
seven persons probably perished. There
are only three known survivors. The
Roinoke was one of the best known
steamers on the iHcific coast and was
bound for South American ports when
wrecked.
The only delails of the sen horror
so far brought to light came from the
lips of Joseuh Krbe, age 2,1, a Sanj
i' r.'incisco, quartermaster or the iit
t'.ited vessel. With two Mexican fire
men, Manuel Lopez nnd Charles liou
eiro, he was saved when his lifeboat
drifted in shore near Port San Luis last
night. All three men were unconscious
and when found were lying among the
bodies of five dead sailors who had
succumbed to cold and exposure and
toppled lifeless into the bottom of the
boot
Krbe Slid that the Roinoke ran into
a li'-ii sea about 3 p. m. Tuesday.
Suddciilv an unusually high wave
crashed into the steamer's side. As
she heeled over, said Kibe, there came
from the hold a muring sound, caused
bv the cargo shifting.
The First Victims
The first victims to die were Captain
ind Mrs. Hichurdsiin Dickson of Oak
land. Losing her footing on the slop
ing deck, the captain's wif tumbled
into the water, instantly the com-
niander -dived after her and neither:
was ever seen again.
Another of those who probably per
ished was John 0. Dennis, of I'urtlanl.
Cr., the second officer. He leaves n j

If Republicans Name Roose
. velt They Will Return to
the G. 0. P. Fold
By, Ferry Arnold.
(t'nited Press stuff correspondent.)
Kew York, May .11. The next move
is up to the republicans in the politi
cal game and may result in leuffiliatkm
or the U. U. P. with the bull moose.
Members of the progressive national
executive committee so indicated today
following yesterday's wnterence, which
declared for political peace, but not
peace at any price.
Convention arrangements were dis
cussed at the conference and the selec
tion of a man to deliver the keynote
speech was also talked over, but an
nouncement of the result of these pro
ceedings was withheld.
It was strongly indicated that if the
republicans concede enough progressive
principles, the bull moose convention
will simmer down to considering the
proper method of entry into the repub
lican fold. Progressives regard their
candidate as a consideration of the first
importance. They will "follow only a
leader who stands for our principles
and is able to ut them through."
Roosevelt will fit niceiy.
It Was admitted that Justice Hughes
might fit, but there was not a chance
for Elihu Root.
It was expected that Roosevelt would
deliver a "keynote progressive speech
at. Kansas City on Decoration day.
Roosevelt has practically abandoned the
idea of delivering 'further speeches west
of there. It is understood that Roose
velt is considering absenting himself
from the Chicago convention.

One Dead and Another Near
Death From Drinking
Straight Booze
Portland, Ore., Mav 11. With one
man dead, and another in a serious con
dition from the effects of drinking
alcohol, police today started an investi
gation into the source o'f the alcohol
supply.
A coroner's autopsy lust night reveal
ed that A. J. Craig had died from acute
alcoholism. He was arrested for drunk
enness ami died in the police patrol
wagon en route to the jail. A. T. Pat
terson is in the police eieer.'iicy !os
pital today gasping for breath, and with
his heart beating weakly and irregular
ly a the result of drinking too much
alcohol.
Within the Inst week the police have
arrested several men who were raving
from the effects of alcohol. '
Drug store records sho- no unusual
sales of alcohol, but police believe some
of the alcohol sold was "doped."
The prune crop situation Is very en
couraging, according to reports from
several of the prune districts. One
grower was of the opinion that the
recent winds and rains were of a bene
fit to the crop, as the undeveloped
fruit were knocked off, which would
have dropped later. Others have ex
pressed the opinion that the conditions
Bow are better than for the past three
years. From Polk county comes the
rcxirt that the crop conditions are fav
orable only in spots; that while one
orchard gave promise of a big crop,
the one adjoining would show no fruit
whatever. Hut the general consensus
of opinion at present is, that this year
tne prospects nre umisunM favorible.
Dispatches today say that immense
damage has been done to the Idaho
prune crop by frosts last niht, and
California conditions are unfavoruble.

Rob Store at Randsburg, Get
Money For Pay Roll
at
San Bernardino, Cal., Hay 11.
Cracksmen escaped with $10,000 in gold
and several thousand dollars in checks
after looting the store of James Illings
worth at Randsburg, on the desert to
day. The money was part of the pay
roll for the Yellow Aster mine, it is
believed.
The robbery was discovered shortly
be'fore 8 a. m. today, when Illingsworth
opened the general storo which he ener-
lates at Randsburg, "a desert settlement.
Trie vault m "which the payroll of tho
Yellow Aster mine was deposited had
been shattered by a blast of nitro
glycerine. Illingsworth immediately wired the
sheriff here and a posse iu automobiles,
armed and provisioned for a several
days' chase, hurriedly departed.
Automobile tracks in front of the
store led out on the desert toward the
south.
Randsburg is just ucross the line in
Kern county. It is believed the pair
who blasted the vault may be heading
toward San Bernardino. The local posse
led by Sheriff Frank MeLain, it was
thought might head them off.
. Miners at tho Yellow Aster, only
three miles from the Handsburg settle
ment, formed a posse under Constable
Lovett nnd nre scouring the desert
wastes in all directions. Kvcn auto
mobile tracks leading from Randsburg
wns trailed.
May 15 miners were scheduled to be
paid, The money had nlways been Kept
iu a safe at Illingsworth 's, usually two

Conference at 4 o'Clock
By E. T. Conkle,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, May 11. General Alvaro Obregon to
day expected to submit in writing his proposal for a co
operative border patrol involving withdrawal of Amer
ican troops from Mexico. This is the Carranzistas' last
hope of overcoming the deadlock in the General Hugh
Scott-General Obregon conferences. As Scott is power
less to decide whether there shall be a withdrawal there is
a possibility of negotiations switching to Washington for
adjustment by the state department.
Meanwhile the militia of three border states is hur
riedly concentrating. General Fred Funston has asked
permission to mount two thousand infantrymen for the
border control.
General Pershing has contracted his lines of communi
cations to a length of 150 miles with Dublan as the south
ernmost base, Nearly 3,000 regulars, including coast and
field artillery, are now en route to the border. A new de
tachment of cavalry has already crossed the line seeking
the Mexicans who raided Glenn Springs, Texas.
"I think we made progress toward a settlement," was
General Scott's only comment on the conference.

Practically All Students Peti
tion for His Return-Reasons
for Refusal Given
The Willamette chapel wns the scene
of considerable excitement this morn
ing, when President Doney announced
to the students that the faculty hud de
cided yesterday afternoon to sustain
ineir former action in regard to the
suspension of Maxwell Hall, who had
confessed his uarticipution in placing u
cow in tho Willamette chapel on tho
night of April 12. The incident has
been receiving considerable attention
of late; a petition was circulated by
several of the students to have Ball re
instated, which was signed by practi
cally nil tho students, and the faculty
in acting upon it wished to ask Mr.
Ball a few questions relative to his
personal attitude. He refused to ans-;
wer any questions whatever. He was
asked if he would substantiate a pro-1
viotis statement to Pres. Doney that nO
other students were involved (there be
ing reports among the students that
Ball never said this), this Ball refused
to do, consequently the faculty decided
to sustain the former action, which sus
pended Ball from the university indefi
nitely. Following are the reasons set
forth by the faculty in upholding their
action:
1. The president hud represented to
the faculty as fully and truthfully ns
he could Mr. Bull's statement of his
connection with the chapel incident and
it was deemed proper idefiitely to tfus
ped Mr. Ball.
2. At a meetig of the faculty May 9
your petition was read, and the presi
ilct stated that Mr. Ball had offered a
proper apology nnd expressed a willing
ess to repair tho damage to the niver
sity property. In the discussion of th
matter, a question arose concerning a
statement which Mr. Ball had made to
the president relative to his being the
troops koeping on their own sides, of
tho lino. The meeting took place in
Scott's private car.
General Amador accompanied Oi re
gon. The conference recessed nt 1 p. m. to
resume at i p. m., but nn announce
ment of its progress wns made.

To occupy the post at Vancouver bar
racks, the ninety third company, Coast
artillery corps, iu command of Captain
L. T. Wnblron, arrived hero yesterday.
only student involved. In order to cor
rect any misunderstanding, it was voted
to request Mr. Ball to meet tho faculty
the next afternoon.
.1. At the faculty meeting, May 10,
Mr. Ball was present; nnd, of tor the
president hud explained to Mr. Ball the
renson for his roquosted presence, he
wns asked whether he had stated to the
president that ho wns tho only Btudent
who participated in the chapel affair.
To this inquiry, Mr. Ball refused to re
ply. Two or three questions of like
nature wcro addressed to him, to all of
which ho rerused any answer other than
to say that he had definitely decided
tho night, before that he would make
no reply to any questions.
4. While the faculty appreciate the
attitude of Mr. Ball, they deem it inex
cusable for any student to re'fuso to ons
wer a question which involves only him
self in the reply. To countenance sueb
would be to allow any student suspected
of misconduct to shield himself by such,
refusal and thereby make school disci
pline virtually nugatory.
5. Tho faculty deRires to muRO it
plain that it is for this reason that it
is impossible to terminnto the suspen
sion of Mr. Ball. But they express the
hope that Mr. Ball will consider the a
cessity of the faculty to require stu
dents to reply to questions whose ans
wers involve only themselves, and
thereby make his reinstatement a pos
sibility. We much regret thnt this new issue
has arisen. We trust that the stu
dent body will be dispassionate in iheir
conclusions and that careful thought
will leud thciu to nn approving judg
