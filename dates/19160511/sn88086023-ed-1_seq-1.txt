Grain in County
Suffers Because
of Recent Rains
PRESENT INDICATIONS DO NOT
WARRANT MORE THAN 75
PER CENT OP CROP.
That the growing grain of the coun
ty Is suffering from the heavy rains
and the recent cold weather seems tc
be the pretty general opinion among
farmers. One man who has made a
trip over the county, declares that
present Indications do not warrant the
expectations of more than a 75 per
cent crop. Others, however, take a
more optimistic view and believe th
grain will come out all rlgh providing
normal weather soon prevails.
Judge J W. Maloney. who farms on
the reservation, declares he has never
seen the grain look worse at this time
of the year. He states that there are
spots of very healthy looking grain
but that, right alongside, will be oth
er spots where the grain Is much
shorter and of a yellowish appear
ance In fact, he says, many fields
show more of this yellowish grain
than they do of green.
The heavy rains of February and
March not only soaked the ground but
also packed It hard and the best cul
tivated fields seem to have suffered
most. The cold weather, too. Is hold
ing the grain back.
Mini' Votes for Miss Sating.
Another block of 35,000 votes was
sent In last night for Miss Muriel Ba

the standing of candidates, this am

places It Is believed. During the past
few days quite a number of voluntary
contributions have been made to the
campaign fund and this money Is be
ing Invested while the 6000 for one
dollar offer Is In effect. Miss Marian
Anderson, the Albany candidate, drop

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., May 11.
When the three survivors of the Roan
oke horror were able to tell their
stories, Captain Guthrie and Govern
ment Inspector Hulls, declared that
they will start an Investigation. These
questions will be Investigated: Was
the North Pacific company responsi
ble for careless stevedoring ? Was the
Roanoke's cargo properly stowed?
Reports left little doubt that the
shifting cargo caused the disaster. C.
P. Doe, general manager of the North
Pacific, superintended the loading.
PORT SAN LUIS, Cal , May It
While patrols watched the breakers
for bodies of the 47 believed to be
dead in the Roanoke disaster, a wire
less from the steamer Lansing said
it had gone over the scene of the hor
ror and had found no trace of surviv
ors. The Lansing left for the scene
this morning. Rumors that another
lifeboat, containing a single corpse
had been found were not substantia
ted and are discredited. As far as
known the only ones who escaped
death were Joseph Erbe, quarter
master and two Mexicans who drifted
ashore with five dead bodies in a life
boat last night. The Mexicans were
unable to talk. Erbe said today that
two lifeboats were swamped in leav.
ing the sinking ships. Two others re
main unaccounted for.
The steam schooner Whittier arriv
ed today and reported seeing no trace
of the Roanoke or Its lifeboats. A
heavy gale was blowing. which
might make It Impossibe for small
boats to keep afloat.
The Roanoke foundered at sea about
100 miles south of San Francisco.
