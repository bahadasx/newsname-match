CHAPTER IX.
Sledge Rises to Emergency.
S LEDGE walked across to the sec
retary's desk while the balance
of the rabble were shouting
■'No!'' and conferred with Ilunt
a moment; then he went back to his
clmir and gazed steadily straight ahead
at nothing. Dis small gray eyes had
no more gleam in them than a dusty
marble.
Hunt announced the net result of the
vote, hut Sledge paid no attention to
-r
6R< S«-b*
"It looks like we're up against it," he
stated.
the ligures. The two votes of Marley
and Bert Glider had been sufficient to
carry the amendment against the other
200 stockholders.
•'We will now vote on the original
motion as amended," observed Marley.
"The motion carries!" Marley was
pleased to state, after the dazed stock
holders had shouted "No!" to tlicir
names. "Gentlemen, It is useless for us
to waste time except for the matter of
formal record over such matters as
this. Heretofore I have been helpless,
but today, for the first time in the his
tory of this company, I control the ma
jority of the stock, and my vote is suf
ficient to carry or defeat any question.
To begin with, i refuse to be held up
I am willing to pay $50,000, for the
franchises are worth $50,000 to us, but
I won't pay a cent more. That's flat."
Bozzam took the chair uext to Sledge.
"It looks like we're up against it," he
stated. "I guess fifty thousand's the
best we can do."
"Hunh!" granted Sledge.
"Mr. President." said Bozzam. rising
to his feet, "since the matter seems to
be entirely in your hands, allow me to
ask If that is your ultimatum ?"
"It is," announced Marley, glancing
at him with only the faint suspicion of
a twinkle in his -eye.
"Then I must beg time to confer
again with my principals."
Again the trace of a twinkle escaped
Marley 's eyes.
"There is a time limit on my ultima
tum," he returned. "You stated that
you were empowered to act. I'll give
you five mifnites to make up your mind
After that my offer is withdrawn."
Mr. Bozzam quite obviously strug
gled with his pride.
"I accept." said he, turning both his
palms upward.
A cheer, loud and prolonged, greeted
that humiliating capitulation. In the
midst of it the huge Sledge arose, his
mere bulk a symbol of disaster.
"Nix!" he thundered, and departed.
*******
Both Phil and Blond.v wore sincerely
mournful faces when Sledge walked
through to the back room the next day.
"He's game, all right." commented
Phil.
"You couldn't make him holler if you
cut his head off." replied Blondy, i>ol
ishing a glass so vigorously that it
burned his hand. "I wonder how Bob
is this morning."
"Must be dead, from what the papers
said," judged Phil.
"That King Pin must be some dog."
"He's younger, that's all.'' immedi
ately explained Blondy. "He never will
he the dog Bob was. Match 'em at the
same age and Bob would chew him up
for an appetizer."
"Boh ought've been retired." criti
cised Phil. "It wasn't fair to hand him
his first lickin' when lie's old like this.
The big boy's late this morning. He's
been so busy lie's been coming around
at 9 o'clock, and now it's 12."
"Bob's either dead or better, or he
wouldn't he here at all," asserted
Blond.v. "You know, I like that big
Gob."
"That's easy," carelessly commented
Phil. "There goes his hell. I think I'll
beat Adolph to it."
He grabbed down Sledge's favorite
stein, filled it carefully, with exactly
(he right collar of creamy foam, and
lurried with it into the little back
•oom just five steps in front of Adolph,
who had been making change for an
early lunch customer.
Sledge sat iii his accustomed scat, but
be was not looking out at the hand hole
in the gate. T-'or the first time in all
their acquaintance Phil saw the chief
with his chin sunk on bis collar. He
Industriously wii>ed a dry spot moist
to set the wet stein on, but Sledge
made no movement, even of his eyes,
and Phil, who had come in with the
express intention of asking about the
dog, changed his mind and turned to
tiptoe away. Adolph, however, was
more persistent in his eagerness.
"How's Bob this morning?" he asked
in that particularly hushed tone one
uses in inquiring about the critical ill
ness of near and dear relatives.
The mighty breast of -Sledge heaved
with a long, full sigh.
"He's all right," he ghimbled. "Not
a whimper out of him. Call up and
find out."
"Ask for Mike?" suggested Phil.
"Naw, he may be asleep."
"That's right," apologized Phil. "I
know Mike. He hasn't slept nor eaten
since the fight."
"Nor took a drink," added Sledge,
and another sigh, which was almost
like a sol), impeded his utterance.
"By the way," Phil informed him,
"Sunny Jim Keeler is dead."
"Gee, the boss is cut up about Bobl"
Phil reported to Blondy. "I told him
about Sunny Jim, and he never even
grunted. That means the whole third
ward's gone."
- Sledge was not so unimpressed as he
seemed to be, however, for presently
he sent for Phil and instructed that a
big floral piece be sent and that the
widow's affairs be looked Into.
Bendix came in by and by, looking
very much worried, and sat down heav
ily.
"How's Bob?" he asked.
"He's all right," declared Sledge.
"Not a whimper out of him."
Bendix hesitated a moment.
"Did you hear that Sunny Jim Keeler
is dead?" he inquired.
Sledge nodded.
"There ain't a man up there coaid
take the leadership of that ward," went
on Bendix, much discouraged. "It's the
Third that has always saved us."
Sledge, sitting heavily, did not an
swer. He seemed to have collapsed
like a huge figure of dough settling
into a pan.
"That means we lose the Third
ward," Bendix spiritlessly pursued, "so
we're in bad, politically."
Sledge was still motionless.
"I looked up Marley"s Ridgewood
avenue franchise," resumed Bendix.
"It's good, nil right Yesterday's meet
ing was a bright one for him. A few
shares of traction stock traded hands
on the board today. The last lot
brought fifty-one. Bert Glider is float
ing his amusement park. He's made a
dicker with the company already form
ed to abandon the Lincoln Iioad park,
and they're to take over the Person
tract. The Lincoln road property is to
be used for car barns, according to the
latest dope from Marley, and Glider
gets $50,000 in stock and management
of the park. It looks like a cinch for
pretty Bert."
Sledge raised his chin a half inch
and dropped it again.
"I saw Bozzam," Bendix went on
with his report "He claims that,
while you own 75 per cent of the stock
of the new traction company and could
swing everything in a vote, he is the
duly authorized agent of the company
and lias the right to sell its franchises
at the best price he can get, so he's
going to close with Marley."
"Hunh!" grunted Sledge.
"So we lose there," relentlessly pur
sued Bendix. "At this stage of the
game you had expected to have Marley
entirely frozen out and to own the ma
jority of stock yourself, announce the
purchase of the franchises and raise
the stock to par. Now the stock's go
ing up. and most of it has been grabbed
by Marley. I figure he'll clean up
about $100,000 on this deal."
Sledge favored him with the begin
ning of a chuckle at himself, but that
was all.
"Waver has decided not to sell his
house. He'll go to Switzerland, all
right, but he prefers to keep his resi
dence here."
Sledge smiled. It was like the gri
mace of a man In the electric chair.
"But the worst is yet to come." per
sisted Bendix, beginning to have a cer
tain lugubrious enjoyment in the inter
minable list of disasters. "Schwarz
mnn tells me that Judge Lausdale
positively refuses that appointment as
attorney for the anti-dry movement. If
he stays on the bench, Sledge, nothing
on earth will make you right With
all your power, and all your influence,
and all your money, and all your
friends, you can't get away from that
trial; and if you ever come to a show
down they'll get you. The best yon
can do will be two years away from
the sunshine. When you go out for a
walk you'll have your hand on the
shoulder of the man in front of yon,
and when you get back into the Occi
dent you won't have enough of the or
ganization left to act as pallbearers."
Sledge's chin sank a little lower on
his collar. He had never permitted
the shadow of defeat to touch even the
hem of his coat, but now Its dimness
seemed very close to him, and in that
shade there was a chill.
Adolph brought in a letter, a square
white envelope which looked strangely
out of place on the edge of a beer tray.
Bendix took it, sent Adolph out with
a jerk of his thumb and started to
open it. but the flap was sealed with a
fancifully wrought monogram stamp
ed in gold sealing wax, and after a
moment of reflection he passed it si
lently over to his chief.
SI Alge opened it mechanically and
ly
*
of
drew out a neatly engraved card, which
read as follows:
Mr. B. Franklin Marley
begs to announce the
engagement
of his daughter,
Ethelyn, '
To Mr. Albert T. Glider.
Sledge slipped that announcement
calmly in his pocket and turned slow
ly to his pitcher on the table. What
ever his idea concerning that may
have been he changed it, for, his eyes
slowly distending, he reached out and
grabbed the pitcher, and suddenly there
was a splintering crash. He had
thrown the piteher with its contents
straight through the window, glass and
* 11 !
"All off with the roses, eh?" surmis
ed Bendix, considerately concealing his
sympathetic knowledge of the hurt
which had been inflicted.
"Naw!" roared Sledge. "They sent
me some blanked pink ones!"
CHAPTER X.
The Quarrel.
S LEDGE'S first step toward "pick
ing up the beaus" was to send
Bendix down to round up the
Third ward and then to lock
himself in the president's room of the
First National for an hour, at the end
of which time he sent for Davis.
"I want $750,000," he directed.
"Yes, sir." hesitated Mr. Davis; then
he added aiwlogetically, "You know we
expect the bank inspector to surprise
us day after tomorrow."
"Wire him to put it off ten days," or
dered Sledge.
"I suppose you'll flx us up with a
temporary acknowledgment of some
sort and be ready to turn over some
securities in that time."
"Any way you say," agreed Sledge
indifferently, and fell again to such
deep musing that he did not hear
Davis' elaborate explanation of how
the thing would be managed.
Presently Davis, who carried a peni
teiitiary sentence to bed with him ev
ery night in case anything happened to
Sledge before morning, brought him
some papers to sign, and the felony
was committed—simply, neatly and
with no apparent effort.
Sledge, bearing his certificate of de
posit, went over to the Merchants'
hank, where he transacted a little
equally expeditious business with Pres
ident Johnson, who. with his forehead
corrugated like a washboard, took
Sledge's cheek and gave him a receipt
for it; then the boss went to see Boz
zam.
"You sold those franchises yet?" he
demanded. t
"Not yet," replied Bozzam. "But I'm
going to. Look here, Sledge, why not
be reasonable about this thing? Fifty
thousand is all we can get. Why not
take It. give us our fifth and let us get
away. We're disappointed, but we're
not saying anything."
"Aw, tang up!" rasped Sledge. "You
told Bendix you had a right to,sell it
and was going to. Why didn't you?"
"I've been waiting because I wanted
to act with your cousent"
Sledge chuckled.
"You mean Marley was afraid to buy
until I agreed." -
"He would rather have you satis
tied," admitted Bozzam.
"Well, I ain't," announced Sledge.
"We don't sell."
"Not at all?" asked Bozzam, reveal
lng the secret worry under which he
had labored ever since the meeting.
"Nix!" replied Sledge. "We keep 'em
and build. Dig up for your stock."
Bozzam merely blinkecL This was a
blow so unexpected that he could

scarcely comprehend it. Moreover, it
was a blow beneath the belt.
"Dig up?" he faintly repeated.
"Two hundred thousand cash." Sledge
rumbled. "I dug." He tossed Bozzam
a receipt from Johnson, the secretary
of the Ring City Rapid Transit com
pany showing that Benjamin F. Sledge
had paid $750.000 cash for 7,500 shares
of stock in that live corporation.
"Here's the stock," added Sledge,
throwing down one lone certificate for
the entire amount.
"You don't mean that you're going to
make a boon fide company out of this?"
Bozzam incredulously questioned.
"The money's in the hank. Make
good or let go."
Bozzam felt his circulation stopping.
"We can't let go!" he blurted in acute
pain.
"Sure not." said Sledge, lifting his
teavy upper lip to snarl at him vln
ib lively. "You cheap crooks thought
you could double cross me. You bought
stock in Bert Glider's name. You
loaned Marley enough to buy control.
Any way you fix it you lose."
Bozzam reflected over that statement
carefully. He viewed it from every
angle. He twisted and slanted it and
turned it upside down to look at the
bottom. It was a flawless statement,
sound and solid in every particular, and
he admired it.
"I believe everything they ever said
about you," he acknowledged and
laughed pleasantly. "Now, let's get
down to cases, Sledge. How can we
compromise this mess?"
Nothing doing. No double crosser
ever gets away from me."
"So I've been told," commented Boz
zam, smiling with keen appreciation of
some unhinted joke. "It seems to me
this is now up to Moodson," and he
touched a bell.
A girl entered.
"Seud Mr. Moodson in, please," qaid
Bozzom, and Sledge looked at his
watch.
Mr. Moodson arrived and took a
chair opposite Sledge and on the other
side of Bozzam, his mouth so tightly
closed that one wondered how he could
induce himself to eat He looked at
his watch, but held the face toward
blin like a poker hand and dropped it
stealthily back In his pocket, as if he
feared that some one might get the
time of day away from him.
"I've a queer little puzzle for you,
Moodson," said Bozzam cheerfully.
"Mr. Sledge has determined to make a
bonafide company out of the Ring
City Rapid Transit, and of course will
not sell the franchises. He has put up
his $750,000 and requests us to put up
our $200.000 to complete the capitaliza
tion. He knows that you financed the
drama at the recent stockholders'
meeting; that you bought 1,000 shares
of stock for $35,000 and loaned $50,000
on $200,000 worth of Marley's. Now,
here is the case in a nutshell: If you
put up the $200,000 to pay for the
stock in this new company it will drive
the other one out of business, and you
can get half a cent a pound for your
$S5.000 worth of stock certificates in
the old company. If you don't make
good on this subscription you get ex
actly the same price for your old stock
as you would if you did. Now, what
is the answer, in view of the fact that
Mr. Sledge is absolutely implacable
and means to do us harm? I shall
leave you gentlemen to discuss the
question."
He left the two experts in sijence,
facing each other glumly arross his
desk, and went Into -the adjoining
room, where he surprised the meek lit
tle stenographer by sinking on the arm
of a bench and laughing noiselessly
until he grew purple in the face.
Timbers came in, looking much dis
tressed for a fat man, and surveyed
Bozzam in astonishment.
"Slip me the good one," he begged.
"I need a laugh worse than I ever
needed a drink on the 4th of Janu
ary."
"We've stung Moodson!" snorted Boz
zum. "For that matter, we all get
stung, but I'm willing to lose my end
of it in order to see that inhuman ghoul
get his.
Timbers grinned to his full capacity,
which was much.
"I didn't know you hated Old Gloom
as bad as I do. Where did he go to
die?"
"Have a look." offered Bozzam,
pointing to the frosted glass partition.
In a corner of one of the panes there
was a little clear space made by the
scaling of the glass, and to this Tim
bers applied his eye. Moodson's face
had turned a sallow yellow and had
taken on an expression as if he had
just swallowed quinine, but beyond
this he had not moved, and neither
gentleman had said a word—Sledge,
sitting in comfortable enjoyment, wait
ing, and Moodson suffering intense
contraction of all his vital organs.
Timbers leaned against the wood
work to chuckle. Bozzam drew him
kindly away.
"Let me look," he requested. "Be
sides, yôu're shaking the partition."
In quiet joy lie watched the wordless
duel within for a moment, and then
he suddenly turned to the meek little
stenographer, who was placidly read
ing, and asked her to call up Marley.
"What do you want with the fluff in
tiiis pathetic hour?" inquired Timbers.
"Hand him his," snickered Bozzam.
"Why docs anybody get fussy with

clear down to the village heart

"Fancy Bert?" guessed Timbers.
"Where does that barber's pride come
in?"
"I don't think son-in-law pulls off his
amusement park, does he?" Bozzam re
minded him. reaching for the telephone.
"Hello, Marley!" he called. "I'm sur
prised to hear your voice."
"Why?" inquired Marley stiffly, be
ing constitutionally opposed to any
thing in the nature of flippancy and be
ing always severe with Bozzam for
that very reason.
"Because you're 0ead," Bozzam in
formed him. "Hadn't you heard it yet?'
"I don't understand you," reproved
Marley. "I'm very busy just now, Mr.
Bozzam."
"What's the use?' laughed that gen
tleman. "Nothing you can do will save
your scalp. Sledge has just decided not
to sell those franchises at any price."
"I thought you were the duly author
ized agent, emt>owered to act" protest
ed Marley.
'T was as long as it was a phony
company," explained Bozzam. "But
Sledge Jias just played a low down
trick on us."
"How could he? What has he done?"

Marley surprised Bozzam.
"I had expected that," he calmly an
nounced. "Suppose he docs?"
"Oh, nothing," answered Bozzam,
with a wondering glance at Timbers.
"He'll just put you out of the business,
that's all."
"I don't see how." insisted Marley,
his voice now pompous again. "You
must remember, Mj'- Bozzam, that l am

use to the advantage of the company
and of myself, for the first time in my
career, my training and ability in man
agement. I fancy that I can protect
myself, even against strenuous compe
tition."
"Goodby, old friend," said Bozzam, in
his tremolo. "You may not know what
has happened to you, but I do, and I'll
send you a bunch of lilies in the morn
ing."
He turned from the telephone in
numb amazement,
"He actually doesn't know he's hurt,"
ho puzzled. "He's been president on
his own vote just long enough to get
enlargement of the coco. How's the
quarrel ?"
"Fierce!" grinned Timbers, turning
from the peephole. "Sledge has just
looked at his watch, and any minute
now I expect to see Moodson move a
toe."
"They're wonders, both of them," en
joyed Bozzam. "I'm still admiring
how many of us second rate yeggs
Sledge nailed to the wall with this one
pin—Moodson and you and me, fancy
Bert, qnd Marley and about a million
poor lollops of stockholders."
"That stock would make good ciga
rette lighters," agreed Timbers. "If
Moodson hurries, though, he can sell
the shares he put in Glider's name."
"But he can hold the bag for the $50,
000 he loaned Marley. I don't know
how Sledge will do it, but he'll make
that stock worth nothing a share and
put a curse on whoever holds it."
"Hush!" warned Timbers. "I think
Sledge is reaching for a cigar. No; it's
only his watch. That's twice."
Bozzam crowded him away from the
peephole.
Five minutes more passed into eter
nity, and the silent wonders still sat
rooted hi the selfsame spot; then Sledge
suddenly got up and passed out of the
door and went down to the depot and
