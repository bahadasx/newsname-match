Men's Lives.
DEADLOCK IN BATTLE
Germans Unable to Advance
French Powerless to
Expel, Them.
London, May 10. The French and
German forces fighting to the north
west of Verdun apparently for the
moment are deadlocked, the Germans
being unable to advance further and
French attempts to expel the invaders
from captured positions , being un
availing. To the east and northeast
of Verdun, where violent infantry at
tacks and bombardments have char
acterized the recent fighting, only in
termittent cannonading is now going
on.
The only infantry engagement re
ported anywhere along the French
front was launched by the Germans
against a French trench to the west of
Hill 304, northwest of Verdun. The
French, however, brought into play
their curtain of fire and the Germans
were unable to debouch.
The shelling by the Germans of the
Russians at the Ikskull bridgehead on
the eastern battle line, which has
been in progress for many days, still
continues, There has been artillery
activity on various other, sectors of
the Russian frpnt, but no infantry ma
neuvers of importance have been re
ported. RUSSIANS MAKE PROGRESS.
The Russians in Armenia, howev
er, have put down with heavy casu
alties, a stubborn Turk attack, and
southeastward, in the region of Mush,
driven the Ottoman forces from their
defenses in a mountain chain. In ad
dition, the Russians, operating west
ward from the Persian frontier to
ward Bagdad have dislodged the
Turks from fortified positions and
driven them farther westward.
The Gorizia bridgehead and the re
gion around San Martino in the Aus-tro-Italian
theater have been heavily
bombarded. At San Martino, Vienna
asserts that the Italians suffered
heavy losses through the explosion of
an, Austrian mine. Bombardments
have featured the fighting on the oth
er sectors of this front.
Dispatches received in Paris from
Salonika are to the effect that there
has been vigorous artillery activity on
the Macedonian front. An Athens
dispatch says the Germans and Bul
garians in this region have heavily
bombarded the village of Mayada,
their shells causing much damage.
RAILROAD IS PROGRESSING.
Semi-official advices from Berlin
say that the Turks are rapidly con
structing a railroad through the

EASTERN STAR DRAMATIC FEAST.
The Order of Eastern Star is pre
paring a dramatic feast for Hopkins
ville that promises to be the most
..I . .
euujrttuiu ever.: ins: nas seen given
for many years. It is to be an enter
tainment in three parts, the first to
be a suffragette court in the mock
trial of a case styled Brown vs.
Brown, and Miss Fannie Phelps is to
take the part of presiding judge, Mrs.
J. T. Wall is to be the prosecuting
attorney, and the other parts arc to
be well sustained by prominent local
ladies. This is to be followed by a
one act comedy full of hearty laughs,
and the last part is to be a handsome
ly staged minstrel show.
The entire cast in its three parts is
to be assumed by local talent for
which Hopkinsville is famous, and
the. entertainment is to be of such
proportions as to require 56 people.
It will be at the Tabernacle on the
evening of May 19th and the fact that
Miss Virginia Williamson, who is so
well known as a talented dramatist,
is to be the managing director assures
an unqualified success from both
artistic and financial standpoint. The
entire program and the cast of char
acters will be announced later.

Men They Allege Took
Part In a Raid.
Madisonville, Ky., May 10. Sensa
tional evidence was given Tuesday by
witnesses for the commonwealth in
the cases of W. H. Peterson and Hol
lie Jackson, men under indictment as
a result of a raid of night riders on
negroes at Carbondale in the fall of
1914, in which George Long, 9-year-old
negro boy, was shot and killed.
Jake Oldham admitting that he had
been a memher of the night rider or
ganization, turned in the most dam
aging evidence. He gave direct evi
dence against the defendants, telling
of the meetings held and said he went
on one raid himself.
Jim Reynolds, one of the men
whipped, said that he recognized both
defendants and several others in the
crowd that whipped him.
Lonzo Spence, colored, also said he
was visited by them and knew a num
ber of the band.
Both defendants attempted alibis,
several witnesses testifying for them.
Arguments began Tnesday night. The
case went to the jury yesterday.
Other cases will be called for trial.

Against the Burdensome Tax
Raises Improved At

CITY SOLICITOR WILL GO

mits a Lengthy Re
port. The City Commission met as usual
Tuesday and disposed of a good deal
of routine business.
One matter was to authorize Judge
Jas. Breathitt to go to Frankfort with
the other committees appointed to ap
pear May 12 before the Equalization
Board to protest against the tentative
raises.
The city tax board has completed
its work and they submitted a written
report on the general character of
their work. Their recapitulation of
the changes made will be submitted
to a later meeting. The report, filed
by them Tuesday morning is as fol
lows: "To the Mayor and Board of Com
missioners of the City of Hopkins
ville: "Gentlemen
"Wo, the undersigned Board of
Supervisors in and for the City of
Hopkinsville, Ky., would respectfully
report:
1 "That we have carefully examined
all lists made and returned by the As-
sessors, in and for the year 1916. We
have considered the property enu-
! merated therein, the location, state of
repairs, material-and construction 'of
improvements thereon, and havecare-
i fully compared same with adjacent
property, and to the best of our abili
ty, have placed thereon a fair, equita
ble and just assessment.
"Several thousand dollars worth of
taxable property, we found, not listed
for taxation. With the aid of Mr.
Everett, one of your Assessors, we
have been able to locate and list a
great bit of taxable property, both real
and personal, not listed.
"Since making the adjustments
herein referred to, and since hearing
complaints as to raises, adjustments
and lists, we would further report in
compliance with evidence presented;
that in some localities of the resident
section of your city, the property ap
pears to be in a most deplorable con
dition; frog ponds, pools, overflows
and marshy ground, ostensibly occa
sioned by ill-constructed streets and
waterways of the city, are presented
in evidence in support of unreasona
bly low lists; the residences and other
improvements throughout the city ac
cording to the evidence introduced,
are in an exceedingly bad state of re
pair, and in some instances appear to
fall down.

list this wo rccopnize as one of theim-
possible tasks your board must meet.
"Realizing that it is an impossible
task to make a perfect adjustment of
all taxable property, especially from
the lists as given by the taxpayers,
the Board of Supervisors take the lib
city n ivvuuuvionding to your Hon
orable body, the necessity of a com
plete map of the city. A map which
will show eacli block separate and
apart, with the number thereon; the
number and dimension of each lot or
parcel of ground therein; the improve
ments on each lot, so arranged as to
show each and every building there
on. Said map should further show
the owner's name, the assessment of
the ground and the improvements
separately, so that a just, equitable
and fair assessment .of all property
can be made. In our opinion this
map would be of great value to your
commission. There is a tendency to
overlook and underestimate a number
of houses and lots where listed as a
whole, or where several houses are
grouped and listed as one lot, the as
sessment value appearing a great deal
less than it would if considered sepa
rately. "Such a map would enable your
assessors and Board of Supervisors
to list and assess for taxation every
lot and improvement thereon within
the limits of the city, which in our
opinion is not due under the present
system. It would guarantee to your
citizens a fairer equalization of the
burden of taxes.
"We would further recommend to
your honorable body, the establish
ing beyond question of the lines of
your city limits, wnicn m many in
stances we find in question and un
settled.
"We have labored earnestly, striv
ing to reach an equitable assessment
of comparative values, and to the best
of our judgment, under our oath of
office, we have made such changes,
as in our judgment was fair and
equitable. We herewith transmit the
records of our work and trust that
our labors have not been in vain.

Fox of the Texas rangers reported
last afternoon to Col. Sibley that sev
en American soldiers and members
of a posse had engaged a small band
of Villa bandits across the Rio Grande
and had killed several of them. There
were no American losses.
THE BORDER SITUATION.
Washington, May 10.With 8,000
additional troops under orders to leave
for the Mexican border, including
4,000 national guardsmen from Arizo
na, New Mexico and Texas, adminis
tration officials feel that immediate
necessary steps have been taken to
prevent further raiding of American
towns by bandits.
Meanwhile the final outcome of the
conference at EI Paso between Mai.
Gen. Scott and Gen. Obregon, the
Carranza war minister, is awaited
with considerable anxiety.
President Wilson and his cabinet
discussed the Mexican situation
but the president had authorized the
new troop orders before his advisers
gathered. Gen. Scott and Gen. Fun
ston recommended early in the day
that additional forces be sent to the
border. After an exchange of tele
grams, Gen. Funston suggested that
the national guard from the three
states named be called out in addi
tion to the sending of all the remain
ing regular infantry to join his com
mand. His suggestion was promptly
approved and orders dispatched.
PESSIMISTIC OVER OBREGON
CONDUCT.
Some members of the cabinet wero
frankly pessimistic after the meeting
over the delay ot uen. Ubreuon in
ratifying the agreement he negotiated
with Gen. Scott covering co-operative
border operations, including those of
Gen. Pershing's expedition. Reports
from Mexico City indicated that the
agreement had been approved by
Gen. Carranza and officials here were
at a loss to understand Obregon's ac
tion. No word from Gen. Scott came
to enlighten them. The American
officer was awaiting word from the
Carranza war minister, expecting
some counter proposals would be
forthcoming, although his report did
not forecast their probable nature.
Secretary Baker said the question
of calling guardsmen from other states
into the service was not under im-
