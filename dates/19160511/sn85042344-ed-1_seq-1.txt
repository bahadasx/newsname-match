SUSSEX ATTACK
AN ILLEGAL ONE
Concede in Note that Assur
ances Given U. S. Were
Not Adhered to.
SAYS THE COMMANDER
HAS BEEN PUNISHED
Government Expresses Ke
gret and Declares Wil
lingness to Indemnify.
WASHINGTON, May 10 Gcr
inuny. In a note received by tho
state department today by cable from
Ambassador Gerard, admits that u
German submarine torpedoed the
chunnel steamer Sussex tn violation
of assurunces given Hie United Btutes,
expresses regret for the incident, an.
nounccs thut the submarine com
mander has been "appropriately pun
ished" and declares readiness to pay
adequate indemnity to Americans in
jured on tho vessel.
It was indicatud at the slule depart
ment mat tho German statement that
the offending commander had been
punished would be ucccpled, and the
Sussex case considered closed, except
for payment of Indemnities ot ttie
several citizens of the United Stales
who were hurt. There probably will
be no attempt to negotiute for these
indemnities or for final settlecmnt ol
the Lusttunlu and other cases pend
ing, however, until sufficient time has
elapsed - to indicate how the last
American note was received In Berlin
and whether the new submarine pol
icy is being lived up to.
Not Lived I'p To.
Officials of the state department
noted particularly the piutsuge of the
note which said In view or these cir
cumstances the German government
frankly admits thut the assurace
given the American government that
passenger vessels were not to be at
tacked without warning, hus not been
adhered to in the present case." This
was regarded as indicating a purpose
on Germany's part tn decline to pay
Indemnities for Americans killed or
injured in attacks on ships other than
passenger liners prior to the date of
tho last note in which the Gorman
government promised that freight, as
well as passenger vessels, would not
be attacked without warning or with
out provision for the safety of per
sons aboard. Any respnn.so to the note
received today probably will make a
distinct reservation of the American
rights on this point.

OKLAHOMA CITV, May 10. In the
event thut the Oklahoma national
guard is culled to Join tho state
militia that has been ordered tn the
border for duty, they could bo
mobilized and ready to move within
12 hours. While no suggestion of
any kind has been received by Ad
jutant General Canton that the Okla
homa guard would be called on to
Join the other national guardsmen
who have been sent to the Mexican
border, there Is a possibility that this
might be done. The guardsmen of
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona have
been called, and next conies Okla
homa In geographical location. The
members of the Oklahoma guard are
acclimated to the semi-tropical atmos
phere of the Mexican country and It
would be natural that men for field
duty such as would be expected should
be those with the advantage of being
seasoned. Adjutant General Canton
always keeps in close touch with the
condition of the men In the Oklahoma
guard nnd In case of an emergency
would be in position to mobilize his
men in a very few hours.

German Apology in
thie Sussex Tragedy
SUPPLEMENTING his note of the fourth instant cnnt'rriiing
tho conduct of the German submarine warfare, the under
signet! has the honor to inform his excellency, the American am
hassador, Mr. James Gerard, tho further investigation made by the
German naval authorities conecrned, in repard to the French
steamship Sussex, on the basis of the American material, has been
concluded in the meantime. In conformity with the result of this
investigation, the assumption expressed in the note of the under
signed of the tenth ultimo that the damage of the .Sussex was to
be traced back to a cause other than an altack of a German sub
marine, cannot be maintained.
Are Now Certain.
"Such an assumption had to be arrived at with certainty
from the material in the possession of the German government for
itself ami without further knowledge of the circumstances con
nected with the torpedoing of the Sussex, the more so, as apart
from the points enumerated in the note of the tenth ultimo, the fol
lowing facts had come to the attention of the admiralty staff of tin
navy through reliable information:
"March 24, 1916, approximately at the same time as the Sussex
au auxiliary warship left the port of Folkstone with a large trans
port of Hritish infantry on board; on the same day a Transport
steamer was torpedoed in the channel; a few minutes preceding the
explosion on the Sussex she had passed through a mass of ship
wreckage which created the impression that a ship had sunk at
that spot shortly before. All these facts justified the conclusion
that the only ease of torpedoing which could be considered under
the circumstances, had struck the Hritish war vessel, whereas the
Sussex had met with an accident in some other way.
"However, on the basis of American material, the German
government cannot withhold its conviction that the ship tor
pedoed by the German submarine is in fact identical with the Sus
sex for, in accordance with this material, the place, the time and the
effect of the explosion by which the Sussex was damaged agree
