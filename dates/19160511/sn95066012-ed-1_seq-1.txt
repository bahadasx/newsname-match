His Probably the Last Infliction of
Death Penalty
CASEMENT YET TO BE TRIED
Government Admits Three Dublin
Journalists Were Executed With
out Knowledge of Military.
London, May 11. Thomas Kent Is
the 13th and probably the last of the
Irish insurrectionists to be executed
unless Sir Roger Casement is convict
ed of treason. Kent was shot at
Queenstown Tuesday, It was an
nounced here today.
London, May 10. Ireland provided a
number of sensations today. The first
was the announcement of the resigna
tion of Baron Wimborne, Lord Lieuten
ant, which undoubtedly had been in
Premier Asquith's hands lor some time
acceptance being delayed until normal
conditions are restored in Ireland.
The second was the appointment of a
commission headed by Lord Hardlnge
to investigate the causes of the Irish
outbreak. A third was the admission
by the Government of the truth of the
report that F. Sheehy Skeffington, edi
tor of The Irish Citizen, and two other
journalists had been executed in the
Portobello Barracks in Dublin without
the knowledge gf the military authori
ties and before martial law was actu
ally In operation.
A fourth was the granting of the vet
eran Dillon's demand for a special ses
slon of the Mouse of C'ommqps to dis
cuss the executions In Ireland, and
finally the Issue of an important man!
festo to the Irish people by John Red
mond strongly denouncing the rebel!
ious movement and eloquently appeal
lug to Ireland to stand fast by constitu
tional means to secure self-govern
ment.
That the country has probably seen
the last of the executions of Irish rebel
leaders was Indicated by statements
made in the House of Commons by
Premier Asquith at the National Lib
era! Club by Home Secretary Herbert
The Premier, replying to a question
said there was reason to believe that
there would be no further necessity
to proceed to extreme measures, al
though he could give no undertaking
to that effect. He was able to give
the positive assurance, however, that
no further executions would take
place before the time of the debate on
the Irish question, which was post
poned from last night to today.

COAL JUMPS UP
Patient Consumer Called on to Pay 50
Cents More per Ton.
Burlington, May 10. As was to be
expected, the increase in wages paid
to the anthracite coal miners falls on
the ultimate consumer, and local deal
ers have advanced prices 50 cents per
ton. They say that such action could
not be helped since prices to them are
exactly 50 cents per ton above last
year's cost.
Iu this connection the Coal Trade
Journal of May 3 said:
"Sense and sensibility have prevail
ed over pride and prejudice. A com
promise has been effected between the
members of the sub-committees rep
resenting the anthracite operators and
those of their employes belonging to
the U. M. W. Both sides to the con
troversy are to be congratulated as to
the outcome of what appeared to be a
most serious situation. As in all com
promises concessions on both sides
have taken place and peace is now as
sured in this very Important Industry
for a period of four years. Increases
of wages have come about as was to
be expected from the industrial condi
tions in the United States at the pres
ent time. These Increases naturally
mean something to be added to" the
price of coal over and above that
figure which is usually made when
the coal year opens with the first o
April. This is quite lit line with what
has been suggested woyld be the case
and naturally conies as V no surprise
either to those engaged ft the1 handl
lug of coal, either at wholesale or re
tail, or to those who use this particu
lar class of fuel. With guclra condi
tion prevailing it remains to be deter
mined if there will be economies In
the use of anthracite which may lead
to a lessened production. Upon this
question there is a difference of opin
ion among those who are well Inform
ed, but of this circumstance the fu
ture must tell the tale.
"Following the announcement of
the new anthracite wage agreement, it
was stated on behalf of the operators
that the concessions granted would
probably mean an increase of between
$10,000,000 and $12,000,000 annually in
the wages paid the mine workers.
Practically all of this amount' will
have to be absorbed by the domestic
sizes, of which the shipments last
year aggregated 41,000,000 gross tons.
This would necessitate an advance in
price of 25 or 30 cents on these sizes
for the one Item of higher wages, but
there have been many other Increases
In the cost of mining which will also
have to be added to the selling price.
"The operators have been hoping to
avoid the necessity of actually raising
the circular price by changing the
sites iu such a way that a larger per
centage of the total output could be
sold for domestic use. It remains to
be seen, however, if this plan will go
through at the present time. This will
probably be decided In another week
or two."
DRIVE AT BAGDAD RAILWAY
Russians Advancing on Mesopotamia
from Two Directions.
Petrograd, May 10. The British
reverse at hut-el-Amara, Instead of
causing the Kufsians to aoandon or
change their plans for invading Meso
potamia, appears rather to have In
spired them with a fresh incentive for
reaching one of the principal objec-
tlves of their Caucasian campaign.
Since General Townshcnd's capitula
ion the Russians have made conspleu
ous progress along the difficult roads
of tho Persian mountain province
which borders Mesopotamia, and, ac
cording to the latest Information,
havo strongly fortified Sorlnal-Kerind,
recently captured, and have driven the
Turks from another series of positions
far to the westward and close to their
U II II UllllUI .
The main threat upon Mesopotamia
however, consists not In this1 isolated
Persian expedition, whirn; is far ' re-
moved from the other Caucasian arm
lea, but in the concerted Russian 'ef
forts to drive the Turks southward
from Mush in the direction of Diabekr.
This direction provides the shortest
route to the Bagdad Railway, the pos
session of which by the Russians
would, it is generally agreed here, be
equivalent to Turkish renunciation of
Mesopotamia.

LOCAL AUTO MEN "IN WRONG"
Have Violated Regulations Governing
Operation of Machines.
J. G. Norton of St. Albans, who is at
present connected with the office of
the secretary of state, has been in Ben
nington and vicinity during the pa6t
few days investigating complaints
that a number of automobile owners
are not complying with the state regu
lations". , :
In the course of his investigation
Mr. Norton has found 13 instances in
which cars are being run contrary to
Jaw, the principal offence being a fail
ure to keep the registration up to date.
It is not probable that there will be
any prosecutions, provided the offend
ers comply with the law in the future.
There has been a pronounced ten
dency by certain owners of automo
biles in and around Bennington to dls
regard the provisions of the statute
and the knowledge of these conditions
has been in possession of the secretary
of state for some time. Licenses have
not only been allowed to lapse but a
considerable number of cars have been
operated on New York licenses and
the privileges granted in the licenses
issued to dealers in automobiles have
beon abused.
BEAT ST. JOSEPH'S 13 TO 8
Bennington High Won from North Ad
ams Team Wednesday Afternoon.
The Benningtoi high school baseball
team defeated the St. Joseph's school
team of North fAdams Wednesday af
ternoon by a sore of 13 to 8. The
game was placed at Morgan park and.
was a ragged, exhibition. The game
was late in starting and it was in the
vicinity of 6.30 when the contest came
to a close.
The Massachusetts students made a
good beginning by scoring four runs in
the first inning largely due to errors
by the members of the home team.
Bennington filled the bases in the open
ing period but failed to tally.
St. Joseph's added three more runs
in the second inning and In the third
the locals came to bat with the score
standing 7 to 0 against them. A bat
ting rally, in which neary every Ben
nington player secured at least one hit
including a three-bagger by Armstrong
changed the complexion of things and
put the Vermonters in the lead 9 to 7.
Bennington blanked the visitors In
the fourth and fifth stanzas and added
three more tallies to home toum side
of the score. Armstrong was again
the feature, this time with a home run.
St. JoBepli scored a final run in the
ixth on an error while Bennington put
over one more on the squeeze play.
The game was called at the end of the
seventh Inning., The line up:

BE MMIA1ED
Will Accept Candidate Who Stands
for Progressive Principles
COMMITTEE MAKES STATEMENT
Colonel's Name Will Be Presented But
Concession Will Be Made for the
Sake of Harmony.
New York, May 11. The progres
sive party will not insist upon the nom
ination of Theodore Roosevelt for
president of the United States, if the
republicans will name a candidate at
Chicago "who stands for progressive
principles and is able to put them,
through," according to a statement
made here last night by George W.
Perkins, tollowing a meeting of the
executive committee of the progres
sive national committee.
"We, of course, are for Col. Roose
velt," declared Mr, Perkins, "and
shall suggest bis name to the republi
cans. If they reply that they will not
agree on the colonel we shall ask them
to name us their man, who ought to bo
as nearly unanimous a choice as our
man is. We arc willing to be reason
able for the sake of harmony."
Mr. Perkins' statement supple
mented a general statement Issued by
the executive committee, in which it
was said:
"If the republican convention is re
sponsive to the patriotic spirit that
brought the republican party into be
ing and made it dominant for half a
century, it will meet thirr "risis in a
spirit of broad patriotism that rises
above partisanship. Should the effort
fail, the responsibility for the result
will not rest on the progressive con
vention, but will rest on other shoul
ders than ours.
J In this turning point in w orld his
tory we will not stick on details. .We
BULL
ill! I
will lay aside partisanship and preju
dices, but we will never surrender the
principles lor which we stand and
have stood and will follow only a lead
er whom we know stands for them
and is able to put them rhrm;,h. We ,
are fcr peace, but not for peace at
any pi ice."
It was said that the republicans and
independent voters in general had re
sponded "urtdergtandingly to the senti
ments expressed" in the statement is
sued in January by the progressive na
tional committee, which in effect, was
an appeal for republicans and progres
sives "to get together."
It was added, however, thaf "there
is an element in the republican party
leadership which seems to be giving
more thought and attention to what
that party is against, and whom it is
against, than to what it is for and
whom It is for. Therefore, wo again
call attention to- our Chicago state
ment as to the inevitable outcome of a
failure to reach a common understand
ing." "Reports from the progressive or
ganization throughout tho country,"
the executive committee's statement
said, "show that (lie American people
have become impatient of leaders who
hold that comfort, prosperity and ma
terial welfare are abovo honor, self-
sacrifice and patriotism; that we need
a reawakening of our elder American-
Ism, of our belief in those things that
our country and our flag stand for;
that our people are seeking a leader
ship of the highest order and most
courageous character leadership that
will draft to itself for the country's
benefit tli? unselfish and patriotic
service of our ablest, citizens. Our
people are demanding that principles
and policies shall be proclaimed and
carried out by a man who has the
wisdom to formulate them and the
manhood to uphold them.'1
Complete delegations from every
state will attend the progressive na
tional convention, which will bo held
at Chicago simultaneously with tho
republican national convention, It was
announced. A number of states, ac
cording to the committeemen, an
planning to send double delegations,
allowing each delegate half a vote
The total number of delegates will
be upward of 10(H). The program for
tho temporary organization of the
convention will he announced next
week.
