TWO MORE GAMES
WON BY FRUITLAND
Fruitland, May 6. The fast Fruit
land high school baseball team lias
added two more victories to Its al
ready long list having this week de
tested both the New Plymouth end
Payette high school teams by deci
sive scores. New Plymouth was
cleaned up 16 to 0 aud Payette was
disposed of without trouble. The
next big gsme will be played with
Weiser Friday, May 11, on the Fruit
land diamond.
The assessor Is not responsible for
the high taxes this yesr, beyond the
extra cost of running his office over
that of the other counties of the dis
trict. The cost In this county is
seventy-five cents a tulle for every
mile travelled by the deputies. The
average cost for the state per thous
and dollars Is f 14, iu this county It Is
123. When one looks over the list
sud notes the unequal value placed
on the property It does not seem to
Justify the extra amount It costs.
LONG VALLEY IS PROSPEROUS
W. E. Leas wss called to Ixng
Valley last week on legal business.
The people there are quite prosper
ous, having received good prices for
their seed, grain tud hap crops last
year. Many are engaged In the dairy
buslneaa aud the checks coming in
each month give them ready money
The town of Cascade Is prosperous
looking, with four good stores There
Is still plenty of snow there, during
the winter It was eight feet deep ou
the level. The waters of the Payette
river are now at flood stage aud the
scene through the canyon Is grand,
as the water churns over the huge
boulders. The log drive was started
thlB week. The lumber people ure
going to have a mill at Emmett or
Letha, probably Emmett, as they
have, purchased the McNlsh mill.
Charles Becker was in the city
several days this week. He has been
around tne northern and western sec
tions of the county aud found that
all pie taxpayers he came In contact
with are up in arms over the high
taxes Here only half the taxes have
teen paid in and all Hi; ulstatid Llg
warrants are called in tllw laV
still a large amount of money in Mr
hands of the officials. They are al
so inquiring why U.e county Judge
paid 3750 for legal advice when we
have an attorney employed for that
purpose. They think that fee is too
big for any common Jack leg attor
ney, it is big enough for a Judge.

WILLOW RIVER TAX
PAYERS NOT SATISFIED
T. W. Daggett waa on the upper
Willow laat week looking after the
property of the Eastern Oregon Ind
company. The people of that section
are much Interested In the organisa
tion of a tax payers league, as they
wsnt to hsve si least soma say aa to
how their money Is expended. They
have to pay the road taxes and be
lieve they should be permitted to
name the rosd supervisor snd direct
the expending of the money. This
year they sent s petition to the coun
ty court ssking for the appointment
of a man they knew to have the inter
eat of the district at heart and who
was thoroughly qualified to do the
work, but the petition waa Ignored
and an Inexperienced man placed In
charge of their money and roads
They believe thst If they were or
gnntsed aud sent a man to the court
that their desires would be carried
out, but without an organisation
thely are Ignored, treated aa servants
rattier than as employers.

NEW PLYMOUTH HAS
MAY DAY CELEBRATION
New Plymouth, May 8. A hlg May 1
day celebration was held here Frldsy
afternoon on tho school grounds, and
In point of beauty and unique and in
terestlng features, was perhaps, the
prettiest thing nf Its kind ever given i
here. The many snlondid drills In
itio children were asDeclallv ...)
and h..H m,.h ., 1..
upon the part of the teachers. The
chief event of the afternoon waa the
srrlvsl on the grounds of the "King"
and "Queen," who were preceded 1V
two little girls daintily gowned In
white, each bearing baskets of flow
ers, from which they strewed blos
soms before the "Royal" party. To
the music of the high school orches
tra the "King" and "Queen" took
their places on the hsndsomely dec
orsted throne, surrounded by their
pages and sttendsnts. Miss Esther
Johnson made a most lovely and
charming "queen." while Uerald
Hamilton looked a real live "king "
Military and patriotic drills by the
boys and girls from the first to Mm
sixth grsdea, a May pole dance, and
other sports were cleverly carried out
and much enjoyed by a large nuinher
of spectators. Two hssebsll games
were pulled oft, rounding out a long
afternoon's program, to the sattsfsr
tion of everyone.
The unanimous support of the re
publicans of Eastern Oregon should
be given to the candidacy of W1 11
Brooke for delegate to the national
republican convention. From Mr
Brooke's wide experience In public
life we know we can depend upon
i 1 1 in to ably and with good Judgint -nt
exercise the duties entrusted to him
ed upon to support such a candidate
and will use his endeavors to reunite
the party.
Do not miss the senior class play
at Dreamland, Tuesday evening, May
16th.

MOTHERS' DAY ON
SUNDAY MAY 14
nte secona sunaay in stay is muih
er's day. This year It falls on May
14th. The beautiful thought of set
ting aside one day in the year lo be
particularly devoted to one's mother
was first suggested by Miss Anuu
Jarvls of Philadelphia, who founded
the Mother's Day luternallon asso
clstlon to provide the necessary or
ganised support for the fostering of
the movement. Thanks largely to
her efforts. Mother's Day has become
I recognised Institution aa the day
ou which each of ua should pause to
acknowledge our debt of affect pp
aud gratitude to "the best mother
who ever lived," on which we should
he wltli her if we csu, and, If we un
fortunately cannot, should make It a
liolm of sending her a message of af
feci ion snd cheer.
The emblem of the day la the wlilte
carnation, and it is Mie hope of the
Mother's Day association Miat it will
be worn by every one aa a tribute ot
respect, not only for his own mothi r
but also for all the geutle and in. hi.

THAT NEW JAIL AND

The Vale Crowd Getting
Restless Over Delay.
"Committee Visits Court." is the
heading over an item In the Vale En

a committee called on the county

the circuit court there wars two men
In the Jail, at present one man la
serving time there. The last term of
court showed the smallest docket In
years and It Is to bo assumed that
while the prohibition law Is In effect
thore will be little call for a Jail.
Now Is ths time for the cltliens to
come forward If they do not wsnt
more of their money wasted. Judg
ing from the experience of the money
paid for tho Rig Bend bridge the peo
ple should not expect over fifty per
cent of value from the $18,000 they
have to blow In at this time and the
same proportion for the many thous
ands thst will be required before the
Job Is finished.
