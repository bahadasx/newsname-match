decided that the daughter, Mrs. Noble
was the rightful owner of the cow and
one calf.

Associated Press dispatches of the
Dickens murder trial which is now in
progress at Boulder. Miss Leppard
left Tuesday evening.
Many Pretty Homes in the Mexhoma
Neighborhood -
One of the prettiest stretches of
farming land and from all outward ap
pearances, at least, one of the most
enterprising communities in this sec
tion of the country is to be found in
the Mexhoma neighborhood.
All the farms show clean-cut, sub
stantial improvement and much pro
gress in cultivation of the soil. One
of the impressive features of the sec
tion which the reporter passed thru
was the nature of the farm dwellings,
many having been but recently built,
all of them practically new, some now
under construction and almost with
out exception the design of the homes
are far removed from the old-fashioned
"box" houses. Among the folks
who have built recently are Messrs.
Spencer, Bulls, Barnett, Smith and
Arthur Wooten. All these homes are
on the bungalow type. Ml. Wooten's
home is perhaps the best and most
attractive in that part of the coun
try. It is constructed of brown sand
stone, the upper part pebble-dash. The
stone pillared veranda is an unusual
feature in country home building.
When complete it will be furnished
with hot and cold running water.
Association After Game Violators
Five antelope out of a bunch of six
were slain by game butchers and
game law violators in the Estancia
valley last week, according to ad
vices received by the Santa Fe Game
Protective Association from Mr. Shea
ron, of Moriarty. One buck escaped,
according to Mr. Shearon. The matter
has been reported by the association
to the state game warden. In view of
the fact that the beautiful antelope
are almost extinct in New Mexico, the
crime is a shocking one and the people
of this section, sportsmen and non
sportsmen, alike, feel that prompt and
effective action should be taken to
bring the guilty parties to justice.
Santa Fe New Mexican.
Herzstein Goes to Hospital
Leonard Herzstein left to enter the
San Rafael hospital in Trinidad Thurs
day evening to undergo an operation
for appendicitis. He decided that the
presence of The Citizen would help
his case and ordered it to visit the

from patrons of the Mission who wit
nessod the "Lion and the Mouse" pro
duction and the Triangle of Monday
night in which Billie Burke was fea
tured. Slats keeps up a wonderful
'ine of service. According to adver
tiscmcnts in Albuquerque and Santa
Fe papers, folks of those burgs are
now enjoying pictures

Sam Wants to Join His Uncle
Upon receiving news uf the National
Guard being ordered to the border,
Sammy Gray, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Tom Gray, attending State Military
Institute at Roswell telegraphed his
father for permission to accept an
offer to join the bunch.
Tom figured that Sammy would be
of better service here at home in the
lumber business than chasing bandits
'round and 'round, hence telegraphed
for him to come home when the term
ended May 24.
Sammy makes the enviable record of
graduating in two years, which is
just half the time ordinarily required.

tween $3,000 and $4,000, that much of
the stock being uninsured. It is re
ported that Mr. Slack will rebuild
immediately and reopen the store as
soon as stock can be skipped.
While the present building of the
Cimarron County Bank was made use
less, President Hammond reports that
the loss is unimportant as the fixtures
were covered by insurance and other

cool within the vault which was open
ed Wednesday morning following the
fire. The bank has already secured
mother building and is ready for bus
iness, it is reported that a new build
ing, of concrete or stone, wil be erect

Pretty Fair for New Country

mention that Union county was a
new" farming country, recalled that
while on a trip recently he saw more

fair for a new farming section. There
