Last of May.
Atlanta, May 10.-The first car of
Georgia peaches .will go forward ' tho
latter part of May,' or about tho samo
dato as last year,- according to ad
vices received here by tho Georgia
Fruit Exchange. These will consist of
n few Mayflowers and other early va
rieties. The first car in 1015 moved
from Byron on May 26 and the next
frc m Fort Valley on May .27.
Tho carly movement, however, will
not bo so extensivo as that of last
year. as thc crop of Mayflowers ? ts
very short. Extensive movemnt will
set. in about June 10. with the Green -
boros and Will -keep up well into
July.
