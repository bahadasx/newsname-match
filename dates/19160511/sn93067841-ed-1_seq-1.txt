Salters, May 7:?The commencement
exercises of the Salters school
were held Thursday and Friday,May
4 and 5, at the town hall, when the
following programme was successfully
rendered:
Thursday night, "The Miller's
Daughter, or, Bound in Honor," a
Jrama in four acts, was presented :
by the graduating class and was
much enjoyed by everyone. Each of
the characters was so well rendered
as to call forth frequent bursts of
applause from the large audience, j
Friday night, class exercises and
"Topsy Turvy," drill by the grammar
grade, class songs, etc.
At the conclusion of the exercises
Rev W 1 Sinnott advanced to the
front of the stage and in well chosen
words introduced Solicitor P H Stoll
of Kingstree, who in his impressive
style delivered the address to the
graduating class in forcible words of
oo tn Eohat. wp should make of I

our lives; that success in life is only
to be attained by individual, persistent
effort; that we should choose our t
vocation and use our every energy i
for its accomplishment. i
The stage was beautifully deco-'
rated with blue and gold, the classi1
colors for 1915-16, and pink carnations,
the class flower. Delightful
music for the occasion was rendered \ \
by the Silverman orchestra of Kings-1
tree and Mi38 Emmie Ferrell.
The session just closed has been j
one of great advancement. Twelve
graduates will go to the different
colleges this year from theSaltersj
school. Too much praise cannot be;
given the principal, Miss Leila B jj
Ferguson, and her faithful, efficient !
assistant, Miss Mary B Heyward, for
their zealous, conscientious and untiring
efforts in instructing the pupils
under their charge.
We are pleased to have with us
for a few days Mrs Ferguson and j
her daughter, Miss Jane,mother and :
sister of our popular principal. '
In the large audiences Thursday j
and Friday nights we were glad to
note many of our friends from Kinpstree.
