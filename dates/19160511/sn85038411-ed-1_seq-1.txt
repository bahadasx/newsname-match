Another shift in the line of attack
upon Verdun is reported in this aft

from Paris.
Holding in check their forces on the
west bank of the Meuse, where they
recently have scored Important suc
cesses, the Germans have again taken
the offensive on the easterly side of
the stream, launching an attack near
Vaux, northeast of the fortres®. The
attack was unsuccessful, Paris de

Probable speedy resumption of In

the region of the Avocourt wood
southwest of Hill 304.
The French themselves are making
vigorous attacks on the German lines
In the Verdun region, according to
Berlin, which announces an assault
near Dead Man's Hill and another
southeast of Hill 304. Both these at
tacks were broken up by German fire,
it is declared.
Fighting In Balkans
The eastern front situation is grow
ing more interesting with the advance
of Spring. All along the line the
Russians are the objects of occasional
sharp thrusts by the Teutonic allies.
Just at' present they seem to lie con
tenting themselves with standing off
these attacks and are attempting no
offensive. In at least one instance
they failed to hold their line, how
ever. according to Berlin which to-day
reports the capture of 500 yards of a
Russian position near Selburg.
Considerably increased activity Is
reported from the Balkans. There has
been much firing by heavy artillery

BRITISH FLEET
REDISTRIBUTED
TO STOP RAIDS
Plan to Use Submarines and
Monitors For Coast Defenses
Bitterly Assailed
WEA KE N S ENGL AND
Change* Is Contrary to All Ap
proved Notions of British
Strategy
By Associated Press
London, May 11.—The naval corre
spondent of the Times in an article in
to-day's issue criticises the recent an
nouncement of First Lord of the Ad
miralty Arthur J. Balfour that the
British fleet was to be redistributed to
prevent coast raids by the Germans.
"Mr. Balfour's statement," the cor
respondent says, "is disquieting to stu
dents of naval warfare because the
first lord appears to foreshadow a re
versal of that policy of offensive de
fense which we have successfully fol
lowed since the fourteenth century.
"The object of the Germans in mak
ing these raids is to bring 1 about a re
distribution of our naval forces to
their own advantage. After the attack
on Hartlepool the admiralty stated
that such raids must not be allowed to
modify the general naval policy, l'his
was sound sense. But now Mr. Bal
four suddenly announces that alter
ations are being made in the distri
bution of our naval forces.
Change Is Weakening
"The alterations follow: First, im
portant naval forces ar« being brought
southward; second, submarines and
monitors are to be used for coast de
fense. The forces brought southward
will presumably be based on some port
not hitherto used for that purpose, but
the Germans will ioon ascertain both
the composition of the forces and the
harbor where they are stationed.
Then, as the Germans use only vessels
of the highest speed for these raids,
any force set aside to deal therewith
must have a similar quality as well as
a preponderance in gun power.
"The weakness of this strategical
change lies in the substitution of
squadrons in fixed positions on out
own coast for periodical sweeps which
we have been told the enemy fleet Is
In the habit of making through the
length and breadth of the North Sea.
"As for submarines, these have
never proved their ability to torpedo
boats going at full speed, and raiders
are likely to have little difficulty in
avoiding their attentions. The pro
posal to use monitors is the most dis
turbing feature of the whole scheme.
To employ them for defense instead
of offense is directly contrary to all
approved notions of British strategy."
