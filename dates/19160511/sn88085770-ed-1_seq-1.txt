IS CORNERED
GETS HiS IN EVERETT AND
IN SEATTLE
Socialist Editor Gels Hearing
Before the nights of
Columbus
Slipper] Pete's Audience Cheers As
Shipley Slate-. Socialist Princi
ples and Demands
When Peter (Ananias) Collins un
dertook to show "What's Wrong With
the World" before an Everett audi
•ace, under auspices of the knights of
Columbus, ho found thai copies of the
Northwest Worker had been distrib
uted at the door, ami 00 the front
page, in large headlines, was the le
gend, "Peter Collins in the Pillory."
Then followed a challenge to slippery
Pete to go to Terra Haute, the home
of Eugene V. Debs, and repeat the lies
he has been circulating about this fer
vent champion of the workers. The
challenge is made over the signature
of Theodore Debs, who says, "1 will
give him five hundred dollars if he
will come to Terre Haute where the
facts are known and 1 do not prove
him to be the biggest liar in America."
Evasive Pete himself got a copy of the
paper and read part of the article to
the audience but failed to accept the
challenge of Theodore Debs. Then
this hypocritical champion of "har
mony" and brotherly love waxed so
hot in the collar that his collar broke
from its moorings as he thundered the
following example of his conception
of "love thy enemies," etc. Said this
harmonious tool of the plunderbund:
"Socialism is the biggest gold-brick
ever handed to the public by as clever
a gang of crooks and confidence men
as ever followed a circus."
Thereupon Comrade Maynard Ship
ley, editor of the Labor Journal, of
ficial organ of the Everett Trades
Council, and who recently resigned as
editor of the Northwest Worker, rose
to his feet and challenged Collins to
a joint debate, declaring that he was
prepared to prove that *s l Collins a had
that cTettilrfc no llsfa' than "f.var.i
ty erroneous statements regarding
Socialism and Socialists". "I will meet
you at any time and at any place you
may wish to name, demanding only
that our time be evenly divided and
that we each have at least an hour to
make our argument," said Shipley.
This statement was greeted by thun
derous applause, even Father O'Brien,
who, with other priests, sat in a pri
vate box, applauded the challenge.
Although the devout Peter had just
been bragging about the number of
"Socialist leaders" he had met in de
bate, he showed the yellow streak
within him when suddenly confronted
by a real live "leader" who was ready
for battle on Peter's own terms. Al
though the members of Everett Local
No. 1 had expressed their desire to
have Shipley challenge Collins to a
joint debate, they had neglected to put
their sentiments into writing, so the
artful dodger took this for an excuse
to refuse to accept the challenge, de
claring that Shipley offered no proof
that he was a recognized authority
on Socialism. To this Shipley replied
that the fact of his having been editor
for nearly three years of the official
organ of the Socialist Party of Snoho
mish County was in itself sufficient
proof that he was considered by So
cialists as a competent spokesman for
their cause. Nothing doing. "All
right," said Shipley, "I'll meet you
again with certified credentials in
hand."
On the following Sunday a special
mass meeting of the two Everett Lo
cals was called, the proper papers
made out, signed and sworn to before
a notary. That very same evening
Comrade Shipley took the train for
Seattle, made his way to the Knights
of Columbus hall, and, when the op
portune moment came, reiterated his
challenge, holding aloft his creden
tials. Again the artful dodger dodged,
crawling out of the situation by chal
lenging Shipley to take the platform
there and then, not for a fair anil
equal debate as demanded by Shipley,
but for a short talk, with no chance
for rebuttal. "Come on now, if you're
not a four-flusher," said the bold
"knight." "I'll leave the four-flush
ing to you, Mr. Collins," replied Ship
ley, adding, "It's not a fair proposi
tion, but I'll take you on anyhow if
you'll give me at least half an hour."
The audience yelled approval and the
fun began.
Collins was tickled to think that he
had forced Shipley to accept the plat
form with over a thou and "knights"
ami their friends present, and after
he had developed a psychology antag
onistic to Socialism and Socialists. By
this manoeuvre slippery Pete wriggled
out of accepting the challenge; for if
Comrade Shipley had refused to take
the floor, he would have claimed that
he had "called Shipley's bluff," and
100,000 IN GREATEST MAY DAY
PARADE NEW YORK CITY EVER SAW
SOCIALISTS AND UNIONISTS JOIN IN A GI
GANTIC DEMONSTRATION IN THE
CITY OF BIG BUSINESS
Favored by perfect weather, from
eighty to a hundred thousand workers
of New York city joined in a gigantic
May Day demonstration, marched and
cheered and shouted in a tremendous
protest of the cIaSS-COnSCiOUS prole
tariat. There was none of Theodore
the Chicken-hearted's "pussyfooting"
by the panniers.
"We, working men and women of
New York city . . . ," began the
resolution adopted by the meeting,
"hereby reaffirm our faith in the
principle of International solidarity of
the working class anil pledge our
selves anew to struggle for the over
throw of the capitalist system and
the establishment of industrial democ
racy and world-wide brotherhood."
In more than one way the demon
stration was the most momentous that
the workers of this city have ever
held. Never before has the first of
.May seen this nation faced with the
possibility of war on both its southern
border and in Europe. Never before

Peter Collins in debate anywhere
and any time.
if he did take the floor, then he could
claim afterwards that he had debated
with Shipley.
The vast audience of Collins' sym
pathizers evidently had expected that
Shipley would not accept the condi
tions imposed in the challenge to
speak 30 minutes only, with no chance
to come back at Collins even for one
minute. When they saw that the So
cialist could not be bluffed nor over
awed, the audience spontaneously
burst into applause; for the Irish love
a fighter. Shipley took the platform,
and for thirty minutes he kept the
great crowd clapping or laughing. It
was really a wonderful and encourag
ing sight to see how a clear and witty
presentation of Socialist principles
could elicit such a demonstration from
an audience that had just listened to
an hour-and-a-half's talk from the
champion tool of the master class.
Wiley Pete came back, of course, with
his usual line of half-truths and per
versions of facts and some downright
falsifications, or misrepresentations.
But the telling blows that Comrade
Shipley delivered to the Collins kind
of "Socialism" produced an impres
sion that no amount of sophistry and
lying will be competent to offset.
This was a case of literally carrying
our inspiring message into the camp
of the enemy.
Geo. U. (ioebel, Everett, May 14.
ASK HIM WHY HE
REFUSES TO DEBATE
Socialists everywhere are requested
to delegate some one to ask Collins
at his meetings why he does not ac
cept Maynard Shipley's challenge to
a joint debate. Ask him if a thirty
minute speech by Shipley is all he
can to stand up before. Remind
him that Shipley offered to go to any
city in the United States to meet him
and divide time, the only stipulation
being that each party to the debate
have not less than one hour' time.
Shipley holds credentials from the
County Executive Committee of Sno
homish County, Wash., and from the
two Socialist Locals of Everett. Be
sides, Shipley's work as editor and
lecturer received the unanimous in
dorsement, three weeks ago. of the
County Convention of the Socialist
Party of Washington. Hold slippery
Pete to it!

EVERETT, WASHINGTON, ! THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1916.
has there been BO well organized a
plot by munition makers ami lickspit
tle politicians to fasten a "prepared
ness" program upon this country.
Added to this are the eighty thousand
men and women on strike in New York
city today, led by the employes in the
cloak and suit industry, the contagion
of the enormous strikes in the Pitts
burg district, and the threat of even
larger Industrial disturbances
throughout the country, born of la
bor's new self-confidence.
Very striking in the line of march
and appreciated by the movie men
present, were the girls of the ladies'
waist and dressmakers' union, who
wore white hats and white dresses
trimmed in red. The bakers were con
spicuous in their white hats, and some
members of the Labor Pageant were
in the parade in costume, carrying the
"war on war" banners in twenty-seven
languages. Much attention was at
tracted also to the division of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers, who
made an excellent showing.
FEMALE LABOR
HAS GROWN IN
GERMANY
BERLIN.—-In a debate on indus
trial conditions recently held in the
Prussian landtag, Socialist Represen
tative Otto Hue declared that one re
sult of the war had been an enormous
increase of female employes in all
industries.
In Greater Berlin there were 408,
--999 female members of sick benefit
funds at the beginning of 1915. This
numbe> Sad- grown to 658,000 in Jan
uary, 1910. Some of these women
worked on night shifts for 12 hours.
This was the case especially in the
iron industries.
The street ear service employs 14,
--000 women, of whom 12,500 are con
ductors.
Organization, although increasing
among the women, is still very un
satisfactory. The wages of some fe
male workers may be large enough to
meet the increased cost of living, but
in most industries the women receive
less pay than the men, so that with
the heavy increase in the prices of
necessities their scale of living is
below normal.

BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S REIGN
OF TERROR ON THE CLYDE
WORKERS BEING TERRORIZED AND JAIL
ED FOR DARING TO PROTEST AGAINST
PARISITIC DOMINATION
The trade union movement in the
Clyde urea has been severely handled
dining the past two weeks and those
interested are beginning to wonder if
it is the intention of the government
to clear out every person in any way
suspected of influence among the rank
and file. All the active officials of
the Clyde Workers' committee have
been deported, or imprisoned; some
two score strikers have been heavily
fined for leaving work; men who were
appointed shop stewards in place of
those removed have been dismissed;
stalwarts like McLean, Muir, Bell and
Gallacher have been sent to prison
for long periods; Maxton, McDougall,
Smith and Benson are in prison await
ing trial; while threats have been
made of proceedings being taken
against others who are unaware of
having committed any offense except
that they have been busy in the cause
of labor. Public meetings called to
protest against the deportation and
imprisonment have been prohibited by
the authorities, and the Glasgow
workers have been led to infer that
a slavish silence on their part will be
acceptable during the war—and after.
The terrorist regime of Lloyd George
is at its height. His dominance will
be short, for the insurgents on the
Clyde will rally their forces and, when
the opportune time comes, they will
act and act effectively.
The Edinburgh Sentences
The four men who were sent to
prison last week at the High Court
of "Judiciary" in Edinburgh were, one
might say, condemned before they
were tried. All of us must make their
cause our own anil every legal means
at our disposal must be used to secure
their release. The Parliamentary La
bor Party does not seem very keen
on moving for the release, of the de-
portees ... and 1 prisoners; therefore we
must ourselves do the work necessary
to secure their release. Take the
cases of Muir, Gallacher and Bell, who
were convicted of "sedition"; the first
two were sent to prison for twelve
months each, and Bell for three
months. The charge against them
was based on an article entitled,
"Should the Workers Arm" which ap
peared in the Worker, the organ of
the Clyde Workers' committee, which
was suppressed in January last under
the Defense of the Realm Act. The
article consisted of about 1,000 words,
and after examining the possibility of
the workers arming, concluded by
stating that there was no need for the
workers to arm as they could obtain
all the reforms necessary by trade
union and political agitation and or
ganization.
The article was published anony
mously and was not written by any
of the three men sent to prison. Bell
had nothing to do with the article, ex
cept that, as an employe of the S. L.
P. Press, he helped to print it; Galla
cher never saw the article until after
he was arrested and was prosecuted;
while Muir, who edited the paper aft
er his ordinary working hours, did not
think the article favored the use of
armed force or he would not have pub
lished it. Both Muir and Gallacher
are opposed to the use of force; neith
er of them has advocated strikes dur
ing the war, and both of them have
helped to make dilution workable.
There have been no strikes at the fac
tories where they were employed and
respected; Muir's employers stated
his was a powerful influence for in
dustrial peace and he had been able
to work out a dilution scheme for
operation in their establishment with
out any trouble; and it is only a few
weeks back since Gallacher was of
fered a foreman's position by his em
ployers.
The explanation of the conviction
may be found in the fact that Muir
and Gallacher were the spokesmen
when the Clyde Workers' committee
met Lloyd George to discuss dilution,
and they said things on that occasion
which the Minister of Munitions did
not like.
John McLean's Sentence
The fourth man to be sent to prison
—in his case for three years' penal
servitude—was John McLean, who
was found guilty of having uttered
seditious statements in the course of
four speeches which he made to Clyde
workers during January. The evi
dence for the prosecution consisted
entirely of official police evidence, and
all the police witnesses excepting one
admitted that their "reports" of what
McLean is alleged to have said were
not taken when he spoke, but after the
meeting. In some cases the reports
were written the following day, and
all were written in longhand. All the
evidence for the Crown was denied by
civilian witnesses who had heard Mc-
Lean speak, but their testimony was
brushed aside. For the past 15 years
McLean had been an advocate of anti
militarism" all over s Scotland, and he
is now suffering for his adherence to
Socialist principles. He has a wife
and two children who' must* be main
tained by us pending his release. TJie
treasurer of t'-..i i Clyde Workers' de
fense fund is Councillor John Wheit
ley, 164 Howard St., Glasgow. '*„■
The Dundee Strike
While the Clyde volcano of discon
tent is smouldering, the workers in
the Dundee jute industry are in open
revolt, and some 30,000 men and wom
en have now been on strike for three
weeks in support of their request for
an increase of 15 per cent, to enable
them to cope with the advance in the
cost of living. The Government Com
mittee on Production "arbitrated," re
jected the claim, and even refused to
reconsider their decision when asked.
The workers came on strike, and are
maintaining a bold and united front,
despite underhand attempts on the
part of the authorities to coerce them
into subjection. The military repre
sentatives had a conference with the
strike leaders in the hope that the
workers would resume without any
conditions; but the workers refuse to
resume unless they are given a guar
antee that their claim will be consid
ered by an impartial arbitrator, who
shall take into account the rise in
prices and the profits of six principal
firms, and that whatever decision is
given will be retrospective to the
date of stopping work. That is a fair
offer, and so long as the employers
refuse it one must admire the defi
ance of the workers.
Mr. Henderson's Folly
Glasgow Laborists are bitter with
Mr. Arthur Henderson, M. P., because
of the letter which he sent to a mem
ber of an alleged "labor" organization
criticising the men who have been de
ported. The letter has been used to
attract members to the "Patriotic
Labor Party," which is an anti-Social
ist organization run by anti-Socialists
in opposition to the local Labor Par
ty. Apart from the intemperate tone
of the letter, which was written by
one who was ignorant of the facts of
the Clyde dispute, it makes the posi
tion of the local genuine labor organi
zations very difficult. The Govan L.
R. C. has written the Labor Party re
questing an explanation and apology
from the Minister of Education. Some
other labor organizations have threat
ened to adopt even more drastic meas
ures than the Govan L. R. C. unless
Mr. Henderson makes a satisfactory
explanation and apology.Myner Col

NO-PARTY
FARMERS HAVE
GREAT HOPES
Socialists Predict the Movement
Will Be Grand Failure and
Disappointment
The nonpartisan movement inaug
uarated by rebellious farmers of
North Dakota is not meeting with
much favor on the part of the Social
ists who understand the meaning and
workings of such schemes.
One of the strong arguments at the
recent state convention of the non
partisan league was that it would try
to keep the farmers' money at home.
"There is, perhaps, some satisfac
tion in being close to some wealth,"
says The Minot Iconoclast, a Socialist
paper, "but we would like to know
how much more of it we are to 'keep'
before we become very enthusiastic
over the proposition. If the bankers,
the loan sharks, the politicians and
the corporations are to take care of
it for us, we do not see much advan
tage of keeping our money in North
Dakota.
"We liked the song 'On to Bis
marck,' sung by one of thier vocal
gymnasts. There is another song
they sing that might have been ap
propriate for an encore but they are
careful not to sing 'Put on More Sand'
after 'On to Bismarck.'
.... ' '..' - ■■
"They are quite human, too. They
do not want to 'array class against
class.' They want bankers, farmers,;
business men and ' wage "workers to -
peacefully' snooze under the same
political blanket. Isn't that too' lovely
of them 'for, anything! \ But what an
awakening some day. '• c '. 1. ~■".
"The basis of most of their argu
ments was the fact that farmers com
prise 80 per cent of the population J;'
of North Dakota. I We don't seem toe':
have the same brand of statistics that §~.
the nonpartisans have. Ours',read \\}
something like this: •■>,
: From 1910 census reports.' . ]
Farm owners, _ renters '$ and man-st
agers, 76,000: ,■!";';•' 'i'':**;'~''■';:
Farm hands, 50,000. ,__lj<

Commercial, 15,412.
Railroad, J12,250. '•'..;,
Professional, domestic and personal
service, etc., 9,600.
"It would seem, if the above statis
tics are anywhere near correct, that
farm renters, managers and farm
hands ought to be in on at least the
chorus of the song, On to Bismarck.'
"But the league is going to over
come all its defects and eradicate all
the economic ills of the farmers of
North Dakota by electing 'good men'
to the various state offices. Where
have we heard that slogan before?
Didn't the Republican and Democratic
parties use that argument a long time
ago You dont hear it nearly as often
now, because even the old parties are
evolving in their methods of faking
the people. Now it recalls memories
of torch-light parades, of noisy bands,
and orators shouting the virtues of
candidates. How enthused we were
and how we waited for the promises
of the 'good' politicians to be filled.
We are still waiting and will continue
to wait until the working class have
enough intelligence to get things for
themselves and not depend upon 'good
men' to get them for them."
