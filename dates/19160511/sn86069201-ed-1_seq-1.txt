AWFUL ACCIDENT.
Howard Jones, son of Mr. Jelf Joies,
was instantly killed this afternoon near
the Kurt in the outskirts ot Danville on
the Stanford pike when he was run
over by the large truck of Tavlcr and
bob.
Particulars regarding the accident
could not be teamed as the Advocate
went to press. One report was that
Mr. Jones attempted to board the truck
while it was in motion and lost his bal
ance and fell beneath the wheels The
truck is being used in hauling crushed
atone from the quarry to Danville.
Mr. Jones was a splendid young man
and was about twenty-four years of
age. The horrible accident came as
great shock to the many friends of the
Jones family in this city. The machine
was being driven by K. Smothers, col
ored. Danville Advocate.
This accident is deeply deplored in
Lancaster where this admirable young
man hud many relatives, being a first
cousin of Mrs. J. It. Mount and It. E.
Mcltoberts.
MOTHERS DAY.
The second Sunday in May is Moth
er's Day. This year it falls cn May 14,
The beautiful thought of setting aside
one day in the year to be devotedto
one's mother was first suggested by
Miss Anna Jarvis, of Philadelphia, who
founded the Mother s Day International
Association to provide the necessary
organized support for tho fostering of
the movement. Thanks largely to her
etforts Mother's Day has become a re
cognized institution as the,day on which
each of us should pause to acknowledge
our debt of affection and gratitude to
the "oest mother who ever lived" on
which we should be with her if we can
and if we unfortunately cannot, should
make a point of sending her a message
ot affection and cheer.
In co-operation with the effort to fos
ter the observance of Mother's Day,
the Western Union Telegraph Company
has provided special telegraph blanks,
appropriately decorated with an artistic
design of carnation and bearing the
legent "Mother's Day", on which all
messages of those who wish to send a
word of greeting or love to their moth
ers on this occasion will be delivered
It we cannot be with tier on May 14,
let us remind lierjn this wuv that she
is still with us in heart and love.
' The epiblem of the day is the white
carnation, and it is the hope of the
Mother's Day Association that it will
be worn by every one as a tribute of
respect, not only for his own mother,
but also for all the gentle and noble
motherhood ot the land.
mid-summer
Press meeting.
The executive committee of tho Ken
tucky Press Association will meet at
thn Seelbacli Hotel in Louisville, Sat
urday at one o'clock to select dates for
holding the mill-summer meeting, which
will be held this year at Ashland. The
committee is composed of Robert J.
Mcllr'yde, Woodson May, II, R Forgcy,
F. M. Thomason and It. L. Elkin.
SUNDAY SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE.
ACCEPTS GER
MANY'S PROMISES
The American Governmeut has ac
cepted Germany's promise to bring her
submarine warfare under the limitations
of the rtognized rulea of international
law as insisted upon by the United
States, and Washington now relies upon
a "scrupulous execution of the altered
policy." Germany la told In the note
just forwarded to Herlin that the Unit
ed States Government cannot entertain
a suggestion that respect for the rights
of American citizens on the high seas
shbuld In any way be made contingent
upon the conduct of any other Govern
ment affecting the rights of neutrals
and noncomoatanu.
The attendance at the various Sunday
Schools of the city ond county as far
as we have been able to ascertain was
the largest ever recorded. In the city
the Christian church reported 303;
Presbyterian 02; Methodist CO; llaptist
100; New Antioch 43; Ituckeye Baptist
210; Huckeye Methodist 208; Old An
tioch 93; Eairview 103; Hyattsvillo 1C9;
Manse 88; Herring 83.
BETTER SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE.
The compulsory school attendance
law, it is believed, has been made effec
tive by the remodification of the school
laws nnd approved by Govrnor A. 0.
Stanley. Under the provisions of the
old a fine was all that ccutd be placed
as a penalty ugainst a person who fail
ed to comply with its provisions but
the present law makes the olfense a
misdemeanor and the parent or guardi
an may be Bent to jail to serve out- the
fine for non-payment. It is thought
that the school attendance will be im
mediately improved as the direct result
of the law.
TELEPHONE COMPANY
MAKING MOMEY.
The following clipped from the Eliza
beth Mirrow is of much intetest here
and no doubt many would like to have
a little of this stock. It says;
'The Hardin County Kentucky Tele
phone Company is in a flourishing con
dition. The directors at a meeting Fri
day night declared an annual dividend
of 60 per cent., the greatest in all its
history. The company is a paying busi
ness enterprise to Elizabethtown, as it
expends about So.lXKJ annually in this
city, the company heretofore has been
reinvesting its earnings in repairs and
extensions, and it if now in a first-class
condition for business. The dividend
this year will be paid out to stoekhold
ers, either in June or July."
MALITIA TO GUARD
MEXICAN BORDER
National guardsmen of three States,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, were
called out by President Wilson Tuesday
to aid in protecting the border against
Mexican raiders,
In addition practically all remaining
mobile troops of the regular army were
ordered to join the oorder forces. By
these orders approximately 8,000 ad
ditional troops were placed under Major
Gen. Funston's command. Behind the
orders is the plain intimation by admin
istration officials that the whole strength
of the National Guard will be similarly
employed if necessary
The orders were issued after n brief
conference between President Wilson
and Secretary llaker over a joint re
port from Gens. Scott and Fuuston, at
El Paso. The two officers stated that
the Glenn Springs raid made it plain
that the border guard must be mater
ially increased.
