>I NEIW POSTMISTRESS
TAI Es, (c AIRGi(iE HERE.
Although the app)ointmenlt of Miss
SN.halie Paton i.o the office of post
n! ;istress at Malta was conlfirmed by
the enllte :so(i- til ,lgo as was
I first aninoaunisced ihrough the columns
of this paper, Miss PIal.ton dlid not
receive her official commission until
Fr'idlay last. 'The final transfer was
made Sunday aund Monday when Mr.
Mr. St. Hill retired and t he new of
ficial commnenced signing money or
ders with the first ones issued on May
8th.
Mr. St. Hill retires after continu
ous service for the government here
since April 10th, 1898, and was post
master since 1912, when It. W. Gar
land resigned in favor of Mr. St. Hill,
who had been his able assistant for
so many years. During all this time
Fred St. Hill was ever accommodat
ing and ready to serve the many pa
trons of the office smilingly although
of late years the business has in
creased to a great extent. A little
record of what has transpired during
the service of Mr. St, Hill will be in
teresting at this time. The first
quarterly report sent in by the retir
ing official was for the quarter end
ing September 30, 1898, and was for
the sum of $148.87. The money or
der report for orders sold for the
month ending the same date was
$112.14. The last quarterly report
made out by Mr.St.Hill for the quar
ter ending March 30, 1916, showed
the business to amount to $2,174.30
and the money orders issued in April
1916, amounted to $6,237.96. This
big increase in business will make
the Malta office a second class office
in July, 1916, and increase the sal
ary of the postmistress to $2,000.
Miss Patton, the new postmistress,
' is one of Malta's most popular young
ladies and as we said before, no more
capable person could have been chos
en for the position. For some time
past she has been the eflicient book
keeper at the Kilduff store, resigning
her position only a short time ago
when she receivewd her new appoint
mcent.
HONOR SYSTEM IN VOGUE. =
The editor of the Call says in his
last week's issue, the honor systiem
is in vogue in the country's largest
prisons, and would infer that the
same system is working in the Phil
lips counly jail under the guidiug
hand of Sheriff Shaw. He niakkes
this conllient after anl article ap
iieared i'n Thie a.nterprise telln f
t.he l cape oii a trusty a week or so
ago, in an enideavor to I liar hr:
skirts of the democratic candidaite
for sheriff j at the con'iing i ele: tiln.
-le refers to the prisoner who maitd
his getaiwav, as a "boy," but at the
time of the robblery wlhich seiit hi
up for six months no10 referee Was
made to his childlike chiara'clr.
It mnight lie interesting to the
public to know just how long tihe
honor system has been working in
the county jail in Phillips county.
Just since the present incumbenii of
the sherilff's office has thrown his hat
in the ring for another term. A
short time ago prisoners were con
lined in the cage at all. times and the
instructions were to keep then,
there. When a certain man was in
jail and was afterwards released by
a jury, it took an order from Judge
Utter to let him out in the sunshine.
Another one in jail on a petty of
fense, anti a mere boy, somnething
like eighteen or nineteen years ofl
age, put in his time in 1he cage int
der instructions of the sheriff.
Does this look like honor siys (tl n
and that "Sheriff Shaw's i'rirer ir

The state was very weak in the
evidence itlrvoducedl and had very
few witnesses, while the defense put
up a strong case and brought out
many facts that had not been un
earthed at the inquest. and that
proved to be valuable evidence to
the accuseld ran. It is very doubt
ful if he will ever be given another
hearing upon the charge,as it would
mean a big expense to Blaine coun
ty, and there is not one chance in a
hundred they could get a convic
tion. From the standing of the jury
it would be a very unwise act to
force trial at a latter date. The re
sult of the trial is very gratifying
to the many friends of the O'Reilly
family in Phillips county, and while
the people here firmly expected an
acquittal, the disagreement of a
jury is, in a measure, the same
thing. Mr. Hurd of Great Falls, and
Tressler and Kirton of this city,
looked after the interests of the de
in Malta Tuesday morning, having
been admitted to bail.
