TUTON REPLY REGARDED AT
CAPITAL AS HAVING LEFT THE
WHOLE
STATUS
What tiie tenor of the President's
next communication to Germany will
be has not yet been decided. It prob
ably will be discussed at Tuesday's
cabinet meeting. The President' offi
cial advisors ate said to entertain two
-distinct view8 regarding it.
Would Accept Pledge.
One view is that the President
should accept the substance of Ger
many's pledge at its face value and ex
gratification on the part of the United
States government for the decision
which the. imperial government, has
reached.
A, general statement reiterating the
purpose of the United States Jto see
that international law is not violated
toy dny of the belligerents, so far as
-American rights are concerned, is re*
garded as sufficient to cover Berlin's
^reference to the British blockade.
Without AnyvCondition.
The other view is that the President
should inform Berlin briefly that the
United States has noted Germany's
pledge to suspend illegal submarine
operations, that this government fully
-expects this pledge to be carried out,
and that the United States cannot re
gard Germany's pledge as conditioned
upon the result of negotiations which
-tiie United States might. undertake
•with another belligerent.
Presents Vexing Problem.
Just what Germany means by the
""principal of visit and search" is not
understood here if the old orders have
been, as Germany declares, in accord
ance with this principle
It Is probable tiiat the United States
will ask for an explanation on this.
«nd ask for the old orders so the two
may be compared.

WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER
OF SUBMAR­
INE ISSUE ON AN UNCERTAIN
BASIS.
80 WORDED AS TO MAKE
EXPLANATION NECESSARY.
-PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR'S SAID TO
BE DIVIDED REGARDING TEN
OR OF PROPOSED DOCUMENT.
Washington, May 8.—President WiL
aon virtually has decided to write an
other note to Germany.
Through the German reply to the
President's ultimatum pledges the im
perial government to suspend illegal
methods of submarine warfare and
thereby has averted an immediate
break in diplomatic relations, it is re
jjarded her as having left the whole
stauts of the submarine issue on an
uncertain and unsatisfactory basis.
Explanations Necessary.
In addition, it is explained, the Ger
man note is so worded as to make elu
cidation necessary.
TEMPLE OPEN
TO THE PUBLIC
Tuesday evening from 7:30 to 10:00
the new Masonic temple was open to
the public for inspection and several
hundred people from Devils Lake and
vicinity took advantage of the invita
tion of the Masons to go through and
inspect this beautiful building. The
regular dedication ceremonies of this
building will take place next Thursday
and a large crowd is expected to be
here.
JV~l.
In addition to the first place trophy,
the team winning second place will be
given a cup which is to be held for one
year, pnd b^mes- the property of
any team only upon condition that said
team win second place twice in suc
cession. It has been made possible to
award this trophy thru courtesy of the
Commercial Club which recently voted
sufficient funds to purchase the cup.
The coaches announce that since a
grader and fifteen or twenty husky
boys with shovels and hoes were put
to work on the track Tuesday evening
it is in fine condition, and should per
mit some fast running by the dash
and distance men. It is confidently
expected that some records previously
made will be broken this year.
The meet will be called promptly at
2 00 P. M.
Prizes will be given out to all who
can stay over, on the roller rink at
8:30 In the evening. A program has
been arranged which is to include pre
sentation of all awards by Supt. Sau
vain. To those visitors who cannot
stay over, awards will be given at the
close of the meet.
INTERESTED
Grand Forks, May 10.—All over
North Dakota, interest is being shown
in the very material increase in live
stock which North Dakota shows. The
livestock show is beginning to be a
feature of many well developed coun
ties. The latest is Esmond.
The united Live Stock Breeders As
sociation and the Esmond Commercial
Club are co-operating in a move to put
on a big show in Esmond on or about
July 12th. From the present indica
tions the show will be a great success
I for the same reason that the associa
tion members and this vicinity in gen
eral are very proud of their Short
'horn stock and the outside world is
very anxious to take a look at these
animals, and this has been the first
opportunity afforded.
The men in charge expect to put
these fine Shorthorns in a big parade
so everyone can have a look at them
and then let the people know of the
excellent suality, give them a taste of
a prime Shorthorn steer at a big bar
becue.
Several of tiie most prominent
speakers in the Northwest have prom
ised to be here for the occasion, and a
good program will be arranged.

ON SATURDAY
Entries have been received from
five schools outside of Devils Lake, for
tiie 3rd annual Track and Field meet
to be held on the Athletic Field next
Saturday. Considerable interest has
been shown by other schools, as exi
denced by the number of men they
have entered. The Ft. Totten Indian
school will enter ten men, the school
for the Deaf, eight men, Larimore
eight men, Cando and Webster five or
six men each iind Devils Lake ap
proximately 10 men. The Indians and
the School for the Deaf boys are de
termined to wrest the honors from
Devils Lake, which has been won the
last two meets. A third victory would
make Devils Lake permanent owner
of the big cup, an event which the
other schools wish to prevent if possi
ble. Larimore likewise has designs on
1st honors this year, and should offer
considerable opposition to the com
peting teams from the immediate lo
cality.
YACHT AND BOAT
CLUB ACTIVE
The Devils Lake Yacht and Boat
Club promises to be more active this
year than ever before. This is one of
the main pleasure organizations of the
city, and in the past the members have
done much toward the entertainment
at the Chautauqua grounds and this
year there will be a much larger mem.
bership and more boats and launches,
and if those who have the management
in their hands live up to their past
reputations they will have a most
pleasant and profitable season. The
annual election was recently held and
officers for the coming year elected.
Various committees have been ap
pointed and all arrangements are be
ing made for an active season. The
membership fee has been fixed at $10,
which entitles the holder to all the
privileges of the club, and the outlook
is that the membership will grow very
rapidly this year. Last year they
built a beautiful new club house, and
this year they will add much new fur
niture. It is one of tiie real live or-,
ganizations of the city and is deserv
ing of hearty support by all.
r. ...
The thrifty village of Edmore locat
ed in the northeastern part of this
county is out of debt for the first time
since the town was organized. They
have made many improvements dur
ing the past years and can boast of
more good streets, cement sidewalks
than any other village of its size in
the state, also an up-to-date electric
light plant and many other civic im
provements, and yet the finances of
that burg has been handled in such a
way that this spring they paid off the
last indebtedness against the village.
We want to congratulate the good peo.
pie of Edmore for their financial con
dition, after the many improvements
they have made

REPUBLICAN GETS
D. L. POSTOFFICE
H. S. DAVIES HAS LANDED THE
PLUM AFTER A LONG AND
WEARY STRUGGLE.
Report from Washington under date
of May 6th, states that Hal S. Davies,
who has been editor of the Daily Jour-,
nal in this city for some time past, was
confirmed by the. seate to be post
master of this city. This ends a bitter
struggle for this position, and his ap
pointment was brought about by a
truce between John Burke, J. H.
Bloom, Siver Serumgard and Senator.
A. J. Gronna. Davies has always vot.
ed and registered as a Republican, and
thus the old time Democrats of this
city and county, have been forced to
step aside to make place for a Re
publican, thanks to John Burke and A.
J. Gronna, who. seem to be riding in
the same boat at present.
PROF. J. A. HAIG'S
AUTO BURNED
While driving to Hope township on
Tuesday forenoon to visit schools Prof.
Haig had the misfortune to have his
new car burned up. He had to drive
out of the road in a bad place and in
passing near a straw stack and over
ttye edge of the straw his a^to, back
fired, setting fire to the straw and be
fore he could get his car out it caught
fire and all he could do was to get out
and stand off at a distance and watch
it burn. He had it insured with the
Powell agency for $600. We under
stand that he has purchased another
car.

New York, Mqy 8.—Theodore Roose
velt is the overwhelmingly choice for
the Republican presidential nomina
tion in the Tribune's national primary.
He polled slightly more than 5 1-4
votes for every one cast for Charles
Evans Hughes.
A total of 6,984 ballots were re
turned in time to be counted for the
present summary, 5,620 being for the
Colonel, 1,064 for Justice Hughes, 196
for Elihu Root and the rest being
scattered among twenty-four other
names, no one getting more than 25
votes.
Roosevelt's Ratio Is 4 to 1.
/Hie ratio for .Roosevelt against the
field is more than 4 to' 1. Henry Ford
got 25 votes, William Howard Taft
and President Wilson 19.
A further index of the strength of
Roosevelt sentiment was shown in 347
additional votes sent otherwise than
in strict accordance with the terms
provided for the contest. Of these 286
were for Roosevelt, 33 for Hughes, 5
for Root and 23 scattering.
Colonel Gains In East.
Annalysis of the vote shows a sig
nificant shift in the center of gravity
of Roosevelt sentiment. Whereas the
Middle West was far more strongly
for Roosevelt in 1912 than the East,
the present figure bring out that, al
though the West is still for him, his
gain of strength is now more marked
in the East, with its exposed coast con.
stituting a constant argument for ade
quate national preparedness.

The fire started in an old livery barn.
The flames swept through the main

FEDERAL AMENDMENT TO CON
STITUTION URGED BY REPRE
SENTATIVE VOLSTAD, MINNE­
SOTA.
Washington, May 8.—The repulatioa
by Congress of the causes for divorce
is proposed in a constitutional amend
ment introduced by Representative
Volstead of Minnesota, ranking Re
publican member of the house judio
iary committee.
The amendment follows extended
hearings which have been in progress
before the judiciary committee on a
constitutional amendment proposed by
Representative Edmunds of New
York..
May Regulate Marriages.
The latter measure, however, not on
ly provides for Federal limitation on
divorces, but also virtually provides
for Federal regulation of marriages.
Mr. Volstead has objected to the
form and scope of the Edmunds am
endment because he believes it would
cause infinite trouble and annoyance
to persons desiring to marry, since'
they would be obliged to obtain Feder
al licenses. Furthermore, it would
give Federal instead of state courts
jurisdiction over marriage and divorce
and revolutionize the present, legal
status of the matrimonial state.
Limit Divorce Causes.
Congress may define and limit the
causes for divorce from the bonds of
matrimony," says the Volstead am
endmetit, "and the conditions under
which suits for divorce may be brot.
No divorce shall be granted in any
state except* under its ./laws which
may permit divorse for one or mow
causes, subject to the conditions pre
served by Congress. Divorces grant
ed shall be valid everywhere."
The Volstead provision puts a lim
itation on what may be causes for di
vorce. Nevada, which, it is said, has
entirely too liberal divorce laws, pre
sumably would not be able to enforce
her present statutes.
STOVEPIPE EASILY CUT.
"Some people are greatly puzzled
how to cut stovepipe when it is neces
sary to have short lengths," says a
writer in the Farm and Fireside. "I
just punch a small hole in the pipe and
use a canopener for all but the seam,
which can be bent back and forth till
it breaks, or can be cut with a small
chisel.
The worst wind storm that Ramsey
county has ever seen started Us Sun
day afternon and continued until last
night, when a shower of rain quieted
the dust. At times it' was a regular
blizzard of dirt, and some fields which
had been sown were damaged by the
seed blowing out of the ground. How.
ever it is hoped no serious damage
will result. ..

The Editor of the World spent the
past four days at his farm near Der
rick and other points in that vicinity,
and if there is anything in the old say.
ing that "each person must eat a peck
of dirt before he dies," we believe that
we have had our share. It was a real
sand storm arid men and teams could,
not work in the fields.
Frank Wisherd, of Overland town
ship, recently returned from Illinois,
where he spent several weeks at his
old home and on his return brought
with him several head of blooded stock
including a fine Percheroja stallion, an
Aberdeen Angus bull and cow, and
also several head of Done Jersey hogs
He believes in good stock and is start
ing a foundation for a herd.
M. H. Brennan returned the first of
the week from Chicago where he has
been for a time with his son who has
been in the care of specialists. The
young man is Improving and Mr.
Brennan returned to remain over only
a day when he left for North Yakama,
Wash., where Mrs. Brennan is in a
hospital ai the result of an accident
some time ago.
Mr. and Mrs. Jens Svee are home
