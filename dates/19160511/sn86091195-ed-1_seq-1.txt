THE ECCLES ARE
HERE TO STAY
Plans and specifications have been
displayed this week of the new Eccles
Hotel and adjoining store buildings on
Taylor street, and the site is being
cleared of the buildings that have so
long stood there. The hotel will be a
two-story brick, on the corner of Pacific
and Taylor, 120 feet on the latter street
and 60 feet on Pacific street. The store
and office buildings will be two stories,
and built so that they can conveniently
be increased another story and used
for hotel purposes when the city de
mands more than 52 rooms, which the
present hotel plans provide. The hotel
will be provided with a drug store, bar
ber shop, pool room and other conven
iences of a modern hotel. West of the
hotel will be an up to date garage with
a frontage of 60 feet on Pacific street
by 120 feet deep, which will be separat
ed from the hotel by a macadamized al
ley.
The Eccles Bros, are negotiating for
the Tanner property north of the city,
where it is their intention to start a
lumber yard.
We are also informed that these
enterprising millionaires are also de
sirous of entering the banking business
of this city, where they will buy or
build a bank building. We are reliably
informed that they have an option on
the First National Bank.
WORKMAN GIVES HIS
LIFE IN VAIN.
Peter Nelson was drowned in the
Snake river at the Sterling bridge sev
eral miles from Blackfoot last Satur
day afternoon, while trying to rescue
a young lady who was stranded on some
driftwood near mid-stream. Robert
Stone, who is overseeing some construc
tion work at the bridge, attempted to I
take Miss Gertrude Nelson across the
river in a boat. He lost control, and
the boat was hurled with great force
into the false work of the new bridge.
Miss Nelson was thrown violently
from the boat into some driftwood ma
terials, where she remained for four
hours until rescued. Stone finally land- !
cd on a sandbar half a mile below.
Three men secured a boat and at- !
tempted to reach the young lady, but
the boat capsized and Nelson, one of
the three, was drowned. A third trial 1
was necessary before Miss Nelson was !
rescued from her perilous position, still
unconscious. I
This is the second workman that has
lost his life during the construction of
the bridge.
A VERY COSTLY GAME OF FOOL.
G. W. StoWell, the only live merchant
of Thomas, was in Blackfoot last Mon
slay on a telephonic invitation from the
sht-riff to call at his office and answer I
to a complaint of allowing minors in ;
his pool room. It seems that the
"Judge" is a great caterer to the
idea sure and pastime of the boys of
his monotonous town, and has installed
a j mol table in tho rear of his general
store for their amusement, for which he
charges the regulation price of Id cents
a game. Last Saturday, while the table
was idle for awhile, his 10-vear-old son
took a few pokes at the balls while :
Constable Jensen happened to be near,
and seeing the youthful pool-player im- I
mediately placed him under arrest and
charged his father w ith allowing a !
minor in his place of business. Mon
day he was informed That while he had
committed no crime, legally and techni
«•ally he was guilty of violating the
minor pool room law, and was informed !
that if he would plead guilty to the of- j
tense he would be < Urn It with very loti i
°ntJy. Although Mr. Stowell did not j
feel much remorse for having commit
tal the crime of allowing his son to
play pool in his own home, he pleaded
gniltv and was fined $5, and assessed
another $5 for costs.

East Thursday evening, the largest
and most enthusiastic gathering of
enterprising citizens that ever assem
bled in Blackfoot, met in the basement
of the Baptist church for the purpose
of fostering and encouraging sugges

larger and better city than we now
have.
The evening's program was commen

atable dinners ever served in this city,
and consisted of the following menu:
soup, pressed boneless chicken, cold ham
and tongue, whole and stuffed olives,
salads, delicious bread and butter, frag

ahd city council of Blackfoot, Stewart
Parkinson induced Mayor Peek to fix
up the basement of the'eity hall for fu
ture public meetings, and he also stated
that he had in his possession public
money enough to give another banquet,
and asked that the time and place for
the future banquets be named bv the
meeting. Mr. Powers was not ' long
in making a selection of a committee to
carry out Mr. Parkinson's suggestion,
and he appointed Mr. H. D. Mac
Oosliam, Stewart Parkinson and L. B.
Dustin a committee to set the time and
select the place, for another get-to
gether meeting.
During Earnest Pearson's brief ad
dress he sprung something very novel
on his present friends in behalf of
the Southeastern Fair Association. He
stated that if Blackfoot was to have a
fair tbis year the directors would de
some guarantee of support suffi
''ieiit at least to guard them against the
| annual loss they have experienced in
-............
j the past. And in order to have a fair
this year, Mr. Pearson said, it was pro
j pose.l to sell season tickets to every
citizen of the county who was willing
to buy one, and a thorough canvass of
the county will be made for this kind
of support, which seems very popular,
aifil will undoubtedly meet with the
hearty approval of à majority of our
merchants, farmers and citizens, if the
jirice of the tickets is reasonable.
Some one proposed taking a census of
Blackfoot, and Prof. Vincent promised
to have the count made by High School
students, if the mayor would district
the city, which the mayor readily
promised to do.
Before
djournment was taken the |

met for the purpose of receiving the
resignation of its president, Prof. Vin

visit. James Duckworth was chosen

WAYWARD HOY PARDONED.
Last Monday noon the weeping and
wailing of a boy cast a gloom over the
corridor of the court house. A peep
into the probate courtroom disclosed
the sad sight of a mother and her bov
huddled together with sail faces and
tear-dimmed eyes as though their hearts
were breaking over some sorrowful oc
currence. Probate Judge Doud in
formed us that the boy was one of a
number of other urchins who had stolen
crackers from the rear of Bvbee's store,
and as this was not his first offense, lie
telt constrained to send him to the re
form school. But the bov 's mournful
cries, his mother's tearful aeeetion for
her wayw-ard son, and his constant en
. —........ .........
treaty for another chance to be a good
boy, not only touched the heart of-the
merciful judge, but brought tears to
the eyes of Truant Officer Fannie Kain
and the others who, heard the boy's
sad pleading and saw his loving moth
er's tears over the thoughts of being sen
orated from her son, though disobedient
and annoying he has been to her. We
believe it is the saddest experience in
life to see a mother's love abused by
on erring child, cr to witness the sorrow
and disgrace that is so often the lot of
aged and sacrificing parents, through
the inhumanity or waywardness of their
children for whom they have suffered
and struggled so hard to rear,comfort
and educate. If there is a crime that
we think should prick one's conscience
in the mature years of a man or woman
it is that crime of ingratitude for par
ental love and forgiveness that is too
often unappreciated until it is irret rive
ably lost. It seems to us that one of
the richest blessings in tiie life of a
parent is a goo.l, kind child, while one
of the greatest and saddest curses is a
wayward, unkind child, who often tempt
parents to curse the day that lie or she
was born, yet seldom forsake or even
chide them. A child who is disobed
ient and cruel to its parents, is either
a degenerate or a criminal, and will
| mo »t likely develop into an undesirable
1 member of society, for he or she who ■
loos not honor their parents, will not |
honor their friends or neighbors
