something in the way of making
permanent roads. If there had
been no chance to recover some
of this sum which we are jving
out. or an actual State Road
Fund for counties wishing to
avail themselves of the use of
such a fund there would lie no
question of this kind before the
people of the county today, but
luch conditions do exist today,
and many, many counties are
taking advantage of the offer.
There is a great howl about
. Crittenden county being poor,
and not able to pay the tax!
Crittenden county is about an
average for wealth as shown by
V the State Koad Commissioner's
report, something more than
three and a half million dollars
worth of taxable property in th 1
county. The poor will not have
to pay this tax any way, except
as he is prosperous. We will
not be required to pay more than
20c for each $100 worth of prop
wty, or $2.00 for each $1,000.
In comparing valuations of other
counties, Carlisle, for instance,
whose valuation is much less
than ours, we find they received
$5,000 from the State last year.
From this comparison, and that
of a score of others, weReethat
: our proportion of State Aid, to
be conservative, would be noth
ing less than $:,000. Take this

can be over and . election of di.
rectors held before it gets so
warm. When you take your
flowers there, can you not wait
until this time, so all can be done
at once.
A special programme will be
prepared for this service. Can
not the business people of Ma
rion cloe their houses just one
hour and go out there? Surely
we owe tnis to our dead. We
owe thi also to our Cemetery
Committee that is trying to hard
to get the Cemetery in proper
condition.
Have you a lot out there? Have
you contributed anyting to the
Cemetery fund? If you have a
lot and are not contributing reir-
ularly, then someone is bearing
your burden for you, paying your
part to the general care of tha
Cemetery. Do you think this is
treating the Association fairly?
Begin this year by your contri
butions. Much Work novta tn ho
done and we must have your co
oparation in order to keen un the
Cermtery.
The Association wishea to ex
press their appreciation for the
help given them bv many of the
lot owners who are so prompt to
pay each year. Some of these
are out of Marion. This has
meant much toward the Improve
ment of conditiona cut there.
We regret the fact, however,
that many lot owners here in
Marion, take little or no interest
whatever in the Cemetery.

The Association plans to tlace

drives and walks this year. The
cistern is to have a new top and
a pump. A chapel out there is
contemplated, and, If every lot
owner will contribute each year,
this one great need can become
a reality. Have we not some
citizens, possibly not personally
Interested in the Cemetery, who
will make private contributions
to this cause?
Have you been to the Ceme

A VOID TO TO
BACCO GROWERS
Shortage of Tobacco in Foreign
Countries Causes Great Demand
For American Grown Product.
The Crittenden Record -Prpaa
is glad at this time to be able to
state to the farmers of Critten
den county that now is the time
to plant tobacco and to plant all
that you can possibly cultivate
and care for and that you have
barn room to cure same. This is
Roing to be an unDrecedented
year and the demand for low
grade tobacco will far surpass
the supply. Lugs and trash sold
last week for $6.40. This asser
tioiris based on information fur
nished by the DeDartmenr.
of
Foreign and Domestic Cnmmpr
ce and Crittenden county people
are largely indebted to Senator
Ollie M. James for this informa
tion. At the instance of tobacco men
in Western Kentucky Mr. James
caused cables to be sent to Am
erican Consul Generals "at' Vien
na, Austria, Berlin, Germany,
Paris, France and other points
aad all replys indicated a short
age in the crops grown in the
countries named, creating a de
mand for dark, fired tobacco of
Kentucky and Tennessee of 50
per cent more than previous
years. The Record-Press trusts
that its farmer friends will
it by this information and will
properly prepare their land he
fore transplanting their tobacco
in order that they may have a
iuii acreage per man and limit
the quantity only to the barn
space that you have for properly
curing the tobacco. Not neces
sarily spending much mnnov for
labor if your ground is properly
prepared as the middle and low
grades will be relatively in strong
er demand. The reasons for all
this are too numerous to mention
in one issue of this paper. Here
are a few figures: Low estima

OPPOSED TO IT.
THE ROAD QUESTION
Some Items Ot Interest To Tbi
Ones Who Are Opposed Te
The Good Roads.
I noticed yesterday an article.
some parts of which some of
us think should be answered.
The article says the "the road
bonds run for five years, bearing
5 interest, and payment can
not be DEMANDED under five
years." That is a fact, and
neither can they be PAID under
five years, unless the bond-hold
er agrees. If he prefers that
they draw interest for five years,
he gets it.
The article also states that we
do not vote a tax, but Empower
the Fiscal Court or Commission
to levy a tax. Can the tax
payer on "pay day" discern the
diforenca between thd tax VOT--ED
and the tax LEVIED?
It also mentions some 70 or SO
miles of road that are to be work
ed "FIRST." Does any one be
lieve that anything near that
much road could be turnpiked
either first or last?
It also states that the work
will be done by Crittenden eoun.
ty farmers and Crittenden cpunty
laborers, if they want to do IV
The ROAD LAW says the con
tract shall be let to the lowest
responsible bidder, and gives
nobody any authority or pewer
to dictate to him whom he shall
employ. He may, as contractors
often do. bring his entire force
with him, as men accustomed to
certain work become more effi
cient than others who have had
no experience along that lino, or
he may get his force here, that
is, as he chooses. He certainly
will manage the job so as to
comply with his contract and
get as much out of it for himself
as possible.
The article also states "w
can earn enough with our tenmt
and labor to pay our taxes 100
years. If any one actually
thinks that statement is correct
it is no use to argue to the con
trary. Remember, Mr. Tax
payer, you are paying on this
big debt and interest, year after
year, and at the same time col
lecting enough from yourself to
pay your taxes for one hundred
years. So very progressive!
It says "land prices will go
higher and rents will be hijlu-r.
but the renter will reap a more
abundant crop. I suspect" Uu
writer of this article is putting
the TAX COLLECTOR in the
role of a renter.
It also says something about
"one horee doing the work of
four," "and the price of our crops
going down while the roads are
drying up." The rule dou't
always hold good, as this time
our tobacco went UP whi!
the roads were drying c , and
