In conjunction with President

early development of the city.
Kor some time he boardetl at
the home of P. U . Itudd, father
of Mrs. M. (J. Hensleyof Mans
field, from whom he obtained his
early knowledge of the law, the
practice of which he made his
life work and in which he was
eminently successful, being one
of the oldest members of the bar
in Wright county and one of the
widely known lawyers of the

one of the ablest, lawyers of the
county and one who look into

of the cases in which he was con
suited. 1 1 he thought his pros
peclfve. clieul li.id no case, or a

also leaves many other relatives
and hosts of friends, who mourn
his death.
The city of Manslield, his name
sake, regards his death as a per
sonal loss to every resident, and
extends to the bereaved ones its
sympathy.
He was a man of good deeds,
done unostentatiously and with
no wish nor thought of praise; as
guardian of numerous estates he
showed many kindnesses to or
phans and others. His advice
and counsel and his work for the
advancement of our city anil
country will long he remembered
One of flic saddest deaths that

Prof. J. A. Hylton to Thayer
Prof. J. A. Hylton has accepted
the superintendeiic.y of the Tha
yer public schools at a salary of
$1'0() per year. There are 11
teachers at Thayer and two ward
schools, there being ;;o.uui in
vested in the Thayer school
buildings, grounds ami ctpiip
inent. The Thayer people are
thorough believers in good
schools and are ever striving to
advance along this line, securing
high grade teachers and paying
good salaries.
In securing the services ol
Prof. .Hylton as the head of their
public school system, they, have
obtained one of the best all round
school men in Southwest Missou
ri. As an educator, l'i'of. Hylton
stands high. His yibility and
thoiougiiness ha ve won "for him
an enviable record. Hut. il is not
alone as a school man that he
shows his worth. In the church,
in the lodge room, as a citizen -in
every phase of life, he is a
worker whose intlnence is ever
for what he considers the best
interests of all concerned.
Kor the last six years Prof.
Ilyllon has been at the head ol
the Manslield public schools.
During this time our school has
advanced from the uou apprnved
list to the approved third class
and, two years ago, to the ap
proved second class. Appropri
ations to the Manslield school by
the state have always been un
conditional. The professor had
also served as superintendent
here for three years previously,
being superintendent at Ava two
years in the interim. He was
called back to Manslield from
Ava and reemployed at an in
creased salary. He bail also
taught in tlie grades at Ava and
in the rural schools of Wright
and Douglas counties, lie has
taught classes two terms in the
summer term at Ihe Springlield
Normal. Last summer he at
tended the summer school at the
University of Missouri.
His place in this community
will he hard to till, but we con
gratulate the people of Thayer
upon their gnnd luck, while we
deeply regret losing Prof. Hyl
ton and his estimable family
from Manslield. Mrs. Ilyllon
lias always taken a leading part
in W. 0. T. U. and church work
and she will he greatly missed.
Mr. Hylton expects to leave a
bout June 1 for Springlield
where hV will enter, the Normal
and probably act as leacher.leav
ing about Aug. 1 for Thayer.
The city emmc.il will meet at
Mayor I'M I. Riley's oflice at Ilp.m.
Friday, May 12, at which time
the old ollicers will complete
their work and the newly-elected
ollicers will he sworn in ami the
appointive offices tilled.
The K.O., O. & S. R. R. has re
ceived from the I'Yisco the en
gine which was stmt here before
hut returned for repairs. As a
result, rail road service is much
improved on the road.

tjjuite a number of visitors, pa
trons ami alumni of the school
came up Monday morning to
hear the program rendered by
the ."en in r class. This was our
last regular assembly period and
every one seemed to be glad and
sorry loo. All felt glad to hear
such a uniipte program rendered
by the class of litlti and sorry
that we are not to meet again on
many other such occasions. The
most unitpie number on the pro
gram was an address by .1. IC.
Craig to the members of the sen
ior class. Their work was so
well rendered that it was a gen
uine inspiration to Mr. Craig to
iiilU to Hu tu in .' ioiist. interest
ing way. The seniors eifual to
the occasion ami a re to be com
plimented not. only on their own
work but aUo on their choice of
a young man to make an address
to them.
There are only six members of
tin-junior class this year and
that means a small class to grad
uate in V.I17 but the class is un
usually strung in many respects.
They have as a class the highest
average grades of any class in
the history of the school and
make up by fhe variety of their
talents what they lack in num
bers. The juniors will give their
class play mi Thursday evening
and no one should miss it. These
boys and girls should be encour
age in every way possible for on
them rests in a large measure
the success of the school next
year.

of the graduating class may soon
Hud some useful work to do. ICv-
cry one of them would do well to
continue going to school a few
years yet but if that is impossi
ble they are Well etpiipped for
the onHnary duties of life and
will render efhcient service
wherever they may be.
Lee Wilson of Memphis.Tenn.,
ex-national field secretary of the
(lideons, reader, lecturer, humor
ist, entertainer and story teller,
delivered a pleasing, interesting
and helpful talk at the school
house Friday morning. Mr.
Wilson is a tiaveling man who
always makes it a point to talk
to school children whenever op
portunity offers. He also ad
dresses Sunday schools and oc
casionally preaches. His theory
is to do all the good possible.
His very gratifying to the
teachers to have so much assist
uuee from the patrons and
frientls of the school when help
is needed. The music at the
baccalaureate sermon Sunday
was just line and the faculty
wishes to thank every one who
so kindly joined in making the
services so inspiring and iui-
pressive to the young people.
The teachers are reviewing in
some classes and givingexainina
lions in classes where it is neces
sary to do so to determine tlie
giatles of the students, and get
ting their records ready to make
them as helpful as possible to
the new teachers who come next
year.
During the absence of some of
the teachers this week the fol
lowing acted as substitutes: Miss
Maude Coday for Miss Osborn,
Miss Mabel Coday for Miss Ellis
Miss Alice Tombleson for Miss
CJaskill and Miss Meutie Avery
for Miss Hoover.
A mm passing up a back
