J. S. Cullinan
ON CITIZENSHIP.
Mr. J. S. Cullinan, President of the Texas Economic
League, in inviting the people to study and discuss citi
zenship and to give special attention to the problems ol
government, said in part: "Before we can intelligently
study so important a subject as citizenship we must first
define it. What is citizenship? Who is the best Ameri
can citizen? Search the statute books for a defini.
tion of citizenship aend unless one is a member of the
legal pro .ssion we immediately become entangled in a
labyrinth of confusing and ofttimes contradictory laws
Seeking to promote or restrain most every form of human
activity, much of them good, some of them bad and others
indifferent. But laws come and go; the Constitution is
Sreamble of our Federal Constitution states that our govern
to give its citizens liberty and happiness. Read the Declar
and the Constitution of the United States and one can
LoSclusion that the best American citizen is he who is most
jut. happy and active and who hands down to posterity a civ
ibhb than he found it. The spirit of our country is freedom
i mbecome a true American citizen unless he is free.
a mn- et from documents of State perhaps the best authority
d05. universally accepted by the public. is Webster's Inter
,hich defines a citizen as 'A member of a State: a person,
of eithb r w.-x who owes allegiance to government and
ýs4Oeal protection from it.' Further: 'A citizen as such is
t.M Oti. n of life, liberty and property at home and abroad.'
.S before us the a'ithoritative definition of citizenship by both
-. Soeety and in order that the most humble citizen may feel
-m..ter into a study and discussion of this subject I will briefly
of what citizenship involves for the work of the Texas
Wil be in vain if the most lowly citizen does not feel free
th ht and expression to his obligation to government and
o his fellow nmn.
"M- bodSed adult males, with which I take it we will have
s -eU'a duty. in return for the rights, privileges and protec
. v would seem to be: First, to expend sufficient labor in
UImr5 y occupations, viz., manufacture, transportation and
"'fW-rl himsef and his family ia comfort. Second, conform
I the interest of society under the Constitution. Third,
lnepertion to the maintenance of government in personal

are owners in common and are entitled to the rights

severely for having taken the child
into a saloon and was fined seventy
three days' pay. the time he was
suspended from duty. Mrs. Brown
at the trial swore that her husband
handed her the baby. and did not
throw the infant at her. as was
claimed.
Miss Alma was given a handsome
lavallier by her friends, the presen
tation being made by Miss Mildred
