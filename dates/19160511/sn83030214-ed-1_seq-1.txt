Bcrlin. May 10. The American an
?wer to the German note was delivered
to the Foreign Office by Ambassador
Gerard at 1 o'cloek this aftemoon.
The text of the answer was printed in
the morning r.cwspapers here from a
ib newa agency dispatch.

the German-American submarine con
trovcray il regarded here as sett'.ed,
and nogotiarons, *o far a* they con

?any holds that ita ordera to

withoat str.ngs or condition*. and that,
thrrefore there i* little occasion 7'. j
take up the latest note for further,
discussion.
Both the "I.okal Anzcigei" and the
"Zeitung Am Mittag" regard the note
as acceptable to Germany. The lattcr
says that the German-American eriaia,
-aith its danger of a rupture, i? now
a thing of the past The paper is not
altogether pieased with the manner ol
expression of the note, but says that
that is unimportant.
"The main thing,*' it add*. "is that
the relation* of the two countries con
tinue, to the great disappointment of
all Germany'* enemies, who will doub'
less now try to interpret the answer
as hinting that a rupture is only tem
porartly poatponed. The American
note, however. doea not indicate that
tho I'nited States understood Ger
raany'a 'expeetationa' in the light of
'eonditiona.' and the reference thereto
in the American answer is made merely
for the sake of clearnes*.
"German*. rsallM that American
eitizen<- cannot be required to suffrr
fr.r Eaglloh inhum'anity and disregard
of law? "
The "Zeitung ?m Mittag" points to
the Su<a*T case as an mdication that

FULL INQUIRY
BEGINS AT ONCE
Lord Loreburn Joins Cabi
net's Critics?Commons
to Debatc Executions.
London. May 10. Ireland provided a
number of sensations to-day. The l'ir?t
was the announcement of the resigna
tion of Baron Wimborne, Lord Lieuten?
ant, whieh undoubtedly has been in
Premier Asquith's hands for somo time,
arceptance being delayed until normal
conditions were restored in Ireland.
The seeond was the appointment of a
commission, headed by Lord Hardinge,
to investigate the causes of the Irish
outbreak. A third was the a<imis.*ion
by the government of the truth of the
report that F. Sheehy SkefTitigton,
editor of "The Irish Citizen," and two
other journalists had been executed in
the I'ortobello barracks, in Dublin,
without the knowledge of the military
authorities and before martial law waa
actually in operation.
A fourth was the cntirism levelled
at the government's handling of the
Irish probiem by the Earl of Loreburn,
for many ycars High Chaneellor in the
Asquith Cabinet. It was Lord Lore
burn's remarks ia the House of Lorda
that drew from the Marquis of Crewe,
Lord Fresident of thc Council, the an?
nouncement of Lord Wimhorne's ree
lgnation and of the appointment of tha
royal commission, consisting of Lord
Hardinge, former Yiceroy of India;
.Justice Sir Montague Shearman atid Sir
Ifackeasie Chalmers. former Fermanent
Under Beeretary of state for the Home
Department, to invr. tigate the Irish re?
bellion.
A fifth was the granting of the vet

' mously, with the exccption of two So

Herr Von I'aycr, tho reporter of
the committee. read offirial documentB

i licipation in a peace demonstration,
! but denied that hc was guilty of trea
I son. A majoritv of the committee sup
! portcil Herr Von Faver in the npin
I ion that Dr. Liebknecht had forfeited
parliamentary imnuinity. Herr Von
I'aycr gave the following account of
the' arrct of Dr. Liebknecht:
"On May 1 Dr. Liebknecht partici
pated in a peace demonstration at thc
I'otsdamrner PlatX. The population be
came evrited and shouted: 'Down with

Liebknecht had arranged the entire

When airestad he resisted violcntly.
but flt last he was knocked down and

' There is no doubt that Liebknecht, by

There will he r.o precipitate action
by the I'rogres.'ive National Conven
tion. Georga W. Perkiaa, following a
meeting of the Progressive Kxccutive
Committee, yesterday declared that the
Progre.ss.ves were willing to be rea
sonable for the sake of harmony, but
were not for peace at any price. Mr.
Prrkins, in amplifying a statement is
*ued by the committee, aaid that Prea?
idential candidates had been discussed
Bt the meeting, hut he declined to say
whether or not any possible nominee,
aside from Colonel Rooaevelt, would,
be aceeptanlo to the Progrcssives, on
the. ground that it would complicatc ,
the situation.
"We are going to Chicago a thousand
strong," Mr. Perkins said. "So are j
tha Kepubiicans. We, of course, are
for the nomination of Colonel Roose- f
velt, and shall prcsent hi* name to the,
Republican.*. If they refuse to accept ^
him, wo shall ask them to name their
man, who ought to be as nearly their .

ours. If their man does not suit us
then they can ask u3 to narne a sccoi.d I
choiee. We are williag 10 be reason-j

( olonel's Power Kemains.
Theie was a disposition among those
who heard Hr. Perkins's statement to
construe it as an indication that the
Pi-of*reeaivea wera arilliag to take a|
eandidate etkei thaa Mr. *teoeevelt
It waa pomted out, however, that the
Coloael will also be the second choiee
of the Progreaatvoe.
Belera the conferrecs met Mr, Perkiaa
had laaaed a statement depreeatlBg the
attempt to count all the unmstructcd
dalegatea agaiaat Mr. Raooavolt'a nomi

"If 'uninstrurted' mcans anything,"
hc said, "it means thal the delegate is
not pledged for or against any eandi?

The executive committee meeting yes?
terday was an all-day affair, broken only
by a luncheon at the Manhattan Hotel,
at which Colonel Roosevelt sat at thc
head of the table. A wag remarked
that the Root headquarters were
loeated at the Manhattan, but no one
Btomad te mind this much. There were
no speeches at the luncheon, but the

Decmcr's Store, near Roquilla?. Tex ,
May 10 i by courier to Marathon, Tex.,
May 10). All along the river, for
hundred miles in each direction, ban
dit attacks are imminently expeeted. It
i. impossible for the four troops of
cavalry now on the way here to rcach
any of these points before to-morrow
night.
The places most open to raids are
T.a .Irtas, forty miles WOst, at the
mouth of the Rio (irande Cnnyon, and
Terlingua, twenty-five miles near__r,
where the outlaws are believed to have
crossed on Friday.
The bandits in this region are sup?
posed to number about a thousand, all
calling themselves Villistas, chiefly be?
cause thc largcst group is under the
leadcrship of one who ralls himself
Villa N'uevo.
The Texan band pursuing the ban?
dits who rai.led (lienn Springs con
sists of four privates of A Trnop, 14th
Cavalry. The civilian leader of the
posse, whieh includcs about thirty men,
is Sheriff Allen Walton, of Alpine.
The force has up to now serupuloui
ly tept to this side of the river, but
it is believed that with the arri?
val of the four troops of cavalry now '
on the way here two from the Sth and I
? wo from the 14th the invasion of'
Me\ico will be begun from a new point.

It is neverthelext cvident from the
talk of the camp here that the only
bar to an immcdiate crossing is the
dearth of horse?.
Thc MTOa Americans made prisoners

who since Friday have heen spreading

They brought with them three of ;
their captors, ineluding a lieutenant
colonel \4ith a Camaia commission,

The prisoners are being closely :

declare that th* raid was long planned
an.l that the band of eighty travelled '
for tifteen days before they crossed

PARLEY WAITS
ON CARRANZA
Obregon Asks Authority
to Insist on Withdrawal
of U. S. Troops.
El Paso, Ten., Mav 10. General
Obregon announeed-i.i Juares to-night
that h? waa awaiting instructiona from
Mexico City, and would not confer with
(jencral Seott until they were received.
titneral Obregon, it is understood,
has asked Carranza for authority to in?
sist on the acceptance by the I'nited
States of his proposition calling for
the withdrawal of American troops and
offering to guard with Carran-* foreea
the Mexican side of the border.
Failing in their effort* to have a
definite date for withdrawal, it was re-J
ported to-rr,ght that the Mexican gov- 1
ernment may next try to have part of
thc American troops taken out at oncc,
leaving the rest to cooperate with thc
de faeto forces in pursuit of Villa
group:.
The report was that the Mexicans
believe thc size of QeBOral Pershing's l
army is out of proportion to its mis- j
sion the extermmation of a few hun* \
dred bandits.
ln the absence of new proposals thej
lituatiOB now stands as follows:
Geaerala Scotl and Faaetea are op
poaod to aay agreement which act* a
date for American withdrawal.
However. t'ne American conferreea are
listening to al! of Obregon's propo*al*
while waiting for him to realir.e that
the intentions of the American gov?
ernment. are immovable.
In the meantime Obregon*. proposol
for a jomt troop patrol of the border
ia not given serious considerotion, al?
though lt was roported to Washington.

doubt if the do faeto government can

[Frem t 8t-__r C.rr*?p__n.l__.t of T>-? T-t.-^_a_.)
B Paso, Tex., May 10.- deneral
Pershing has begun to concentrato
his forces in Mexieo as a precau
tionary measure. The advanced col
umns wiil fall back to Colonia Dub
lan.
American consuls on the border
and the few consuls remaining in
N'orthern Mexieo were instructed to?
day to notify all Americans in N'orth?
ern (hihuahua tO get out of Mexieo
at the earliest possible moment. The
consuls were directod to give all pos?
sible aid in gctting American citi?
zens out of Mexieo.
The order to General T ershing di
rected a greater corrccntratnui of his
troops, and the retreat of outposts
toward Colonia Dublan was begun at
[ once. Threatening concen.ration of
I Carranza forces and the strained re?
lations existing because of the Mexi?
can demand that. Amcrican troops be
irnrnediately withdrawn from Mexieo
are believed to be the reason for
, CBtablishing a new base for the
I American army nearer the bordM;.
I .mer to Prolex-t Une.
| At Colonia Dublan General rershin_r
Will be within 150 miles of the baa:
at Columbus, N. M . ard the line of
eomniunications to the border will not
be bo diffl. ult to protect from large
bands of Villistas or I | Car
raniistas. The new Amenrsn base is
.100 miles nearer the border than the
most advanced point reached hy Ameri
can cavalry in pursuit of Villistas into
the Parral country.
The former scattercd and poorly rf"
tectcd lines of communication offsred
a constant incentive to Mexicans to a*
tempt to cut off thc Americans from
their bases. Now the more than 17,000
American soldiers will bc tnav.-cd for
defence against attacks by Mexicans,
ar.d near enough to the border to make
a quick dash should they be nec.led
there. They also are far enough into
Mexieo to continue an irritation to
Mexicans.
Mexican army men regard the new
move aa an evidence of yieldinj. to
Mexican demands that Americans get
out of Mexieo. The- point out that
the American forces have been grad
ually fallinj. back ever since Oneral
Carranza and (ieneral Obregon made
demands for their withdrawal.
Orders to Consuls.
The order to Americans to get out
of Mexieo was ferwarded by Thomas D
Fdwards. consul ln Juarez, to-day to
a'.l Americans he could rcarh by tele
graph or courier. I'nnsul Marion
l.etfber. in (hihuahua, received simi
lar instructions. but as it wae not
known if the (hihuahua CltJ consul
would be in position to reach Ameri?
cans outside (hihuahua Citf Consul
l.dwards extended his warning into the
tcrntory around the capital.
So reason has been given to the
consuls for the new warning to Amer
icans. the notiee received by Consul
Kdwards and the one sent to Consul
Letcher applymg. it is understood. onl .?
to the .State of Chihuahua. It ll BUted
unofflcially that similar in-tructiors
have been sent to Consul Simpleh at
Nogales and to American eonsuti all
along the Texas border.
