I L. 'oan. sr.. convicted at Mt. Ver
non. Ind.. of arson, and sentenced
to a term of from two to L'l years
at the Indiana state prison, was
lroimht to Indianapolis yesterday
by the sheriff of Posey county and
taken -from here to Michigan City.
The story of t'oan's attempts to
1'i.rn the houses and other prop
erties of hks neighbors and the story
of his captuie and conviction is one
of the most remarkable- that ha
come out of the ottice of William K.
I.ongley. state tire marshal. Coan Is
about Ke years old. He hated many
of his neighbors. He lied outside
of Mt. Vermin. Some time ago the
man gave his son. I. I.. Conn, jr.. a
piece of property and Iiis son took
up Mis residente therein, with a
fainil of four children. The son
became friendly with some of the
reighhors. whom the father disliked
extremely. This made the father
anury a tut he finally ordered his sort
t(. move out of the property.
lkCfll4ll tO (i.
The boy had obtained a deed to
the property and refused to go.
Shortly thereafter, according to Gar
ten Fox. in estimator for the state
tire marshal, Coan. sr., sent his wife
to Corjdon to remain there with her
s i t i- for a time.
ne niht some hams of one of
the neifjhhors of Coan were discov
ered on lite. The barns were a long
di.-tance from Corn's home. Be
tween the home and the barns were
other residentes of neigh hors. The
residence of the son was very close
it- that of the elder Co-iti.
Th it same night someone threw a
gallon jug of vaseline into the open
window of one of the neighbor'
bonus, between Coan's i e.-olence and
the burning barns. A short time later

Engineer Blamed
For Fatal Wreck
At Amherst, Ohio
Iiitern.itii'ii.il Ne s Sen ice:
WAS II l. NC. TN, May 11. P.e-
eause he failed to heeä signals set
for him Ilngineer Herbert Hess ia
declared responsible for the fatal
wreck on the New York Central
lines at Amherst, o., on March 29
in a report made public by the in
terstate commerce commission here
today.
H. W. Pelnap, chief of the division
of safety of the interstate commerce
commission, made the investigation.
Hess was engineer of the second
section of eastbound train No. S6,
which crashed into the rear of the
tirst section.
Twenty-seven were killed in the
wreck and 4 7 injured.
The commission cites a possible
alternative cause of the accident
the possibility of abnormal condi
t.onp interfering with the operation
or the signals. "The possibility that
any such abnormal condition existed
is exceedingly remote.
"The conclusion is therefore
reached." the report continues, "that
the enginenian of train second No.
m: must have been mistaken re
garding the signal indications dis
played, lue either to his failure to
see the signals or to read the indi
cations properly on account of tho
dense fog and the speed at which
his train whs running, and it is be
lieved that this accident was caused
by his failure to observe and obey
the caution and stop signal indica

leave five additional bishops to be
selected.
Although an active canvass on the
part of a candidate for the bish
opric Is forbidden, friends of various
prospective nominees are already at
i work in their Interest anil several
names have been prominently men
tioned. Influential delegates are of
the opinion that the following sewn

RELATIONS CLEARED
Obstacles to Friendly Terms
Between Nations Are
Now Removed.
WASHINGTON, May 11. Official
a ( eptanee by Germany of respon
sibility for torpedoing the channel
liner Sussex coupled with unofficial
advices that (Jermany accepted the
terms of the latest American ncte
on the general submarine, issue have
served to clear away the obstacles
which threatened the good relations
between the two countries. Ger
many's assumption of w rongdoing in
the Sussex case is regarded as full
and final so that the case will be
closed when the arnoum of indem
nity due injured Americans 'has
been determined. As to principles
the two nations are in entire accord
now that Germany admits that Ger
man torpedoes hit the Sussex in vio
lation of assurances given the Fnited
States, expresses regret that the In
cident occurred and announces that
the offendini: submarine command-
j er already has been pun shed.
It is understood here that Perlin
will not answer the latest note from
Seo'y Irnsing making plain thit the
United States accepts Germany's
assurances of abandonment of the
methods of submarine warfare,
without a contingent understanding
a to the manner in which this
country shall deal with Great Britain.

International New Service:
WASHINGTON, May 11. Amer
icans all throughout Mexico are
being warned to leave that country
at once. Sec'y of State Lansing to
day made it plain that the orders to
American consuls to urge their
countrymen to return Immediately
to the United States were not con
lined to any particular localities. He
said that the orders were issued to
consuls everywhere in Mexico.
Officials today for the most part
maintained a silence ori Mexican
developments. It was stated that
everything hinges on the result of
the conference today at Kl Paso
between Gns. Obregon and Scott.
Ambassador Sooh Laniiu?.
Kliseo Arredondo, ambassador
designate of the de facto govern
ment, called on Sec'y Lansing today
for a general discuspion of the sit
uation. II? was with the secretary
about 20 minutes.
Upon leaving the state depart
ment Mr. Arredondo said that the

upon some agreement being reach
ed for the withdrawal of the Ameri

of the border by Mexican and Amer

clined to discuss it.
larepaie to Protect Ikmlcr.
Elaborate preparations have been
made for the protection of all vital
points alorg the Mexican border if
the break with Carranza. which
most officiils consider almost cer
tain, comes. It again was stated
officially today that the United
States will not recede from its po
sition, but will keep all of tbe
troops no.v in northern Mexico
there until Francisco Villa is killed
or capture I. Many officials here
feared that, an open break between
Gen. Scott and Mexican Minister of
War Obre?on would come today.
Others, however, believed that at the
last moment, Obregon would decide
to ratify the tentative agreement
that an open break would be defer
red for the present.
Warn Americans Out.
Meanwhile the agents of the state
department are doing their best to
get all Americans out of Mexico. It
is considered certain that in the
event of complete intervention no
effort would be made by Carranza
to protect the citizens of this coun
try. All of the confidential advices
reaching this city agree that the
general situation throughout Mex
ico is getting worse, and that hun
dreds of people are dying of dlsea.se
and starvation. The government is
unable to meet its current obliga
tions and even the soldiers are not
being paid.
The war department has all plans
perfected for calling out the entire
national gtard of the country if the
necessity arises. The quartermaster's
department is in touch with the
railroad companies and at certain
pcints equipment is being held in
readiness for the emergency when
if arises.
