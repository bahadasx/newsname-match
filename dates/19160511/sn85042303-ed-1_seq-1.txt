BUT BOOSTERS
FEATUR E AT THE
1E01CLE
DOCTOR WIILIAMS BY REQUEST
CHANGED HIS SUBJECT LAST
NIGHT PREACHED ON "ZAC
HEUS' THE TAX COLLECTOR."
"Zacheus the Tax Collector" sub
ject of Dr. Williams' sermon at the
tabernacle last night. l!y a large
vote, pro and eon, the audience re
quested Dr. Williams to postpone his
sermon on "Amusements, Harmful
and Helpful," until tonight at 7: 43.
This is in order to give many a
chance to hear the address who were
unable to be present last night. "The
Hoy Boosters" was a new feature at
the meeting last night. Hound after
round of cheers greeted them and
they sang lustily. A more eager
class of boys and girls for religion
of the right stamp that calls for ser
vice, would be hard to find. A great
field has been discovered to many of
the saints who are "sot" in the tra
ditions of the elders. Christ appeals
to children, and His is the only re
ligion that does. It appears that
Ardmore is to be revolutionized in
religion through its children. They
that would be rich and those who are
engulfed in the lusts of the flesh, the
lusts of the eyes and the vain glory
of life, seem hopelessly joined to their
ways.
Dr. Willlatms- question box has
proven a source of rich pleasure and
profit. Among many questions, prac
tical, theological, and knotty, this one
came to light last night: "is it
proper for a Christian to allow his
chickens to scratch up his neighbors'
gardens?" "Certainly not, said the
evangelist, "chickens are to be killed
and eaten; not to scratch up gar
dens." "Amen," shouted a lank, hungry-looking
Methodist preacher.
The ten o'clock morning prayer
meetings have developed great
strength in various districts of the
city. These have developed a host
of efficient workers, women who be
fore were too timid to make an ef
fort at personal work.
Dr. Williams' address on Zacheus
was a character study in the light of
the gospel and the home. Zacheus
was looked upon as a hard case for
rtimi" un rk lie was a renegade
e" 'i -
'Jew, ostracized by his people, holding
'the position of tax collector under
; an oppressive Roman government,
i He was reckoned among the most
1 despised class. "All publicans, all
robbers," had become a proverb. Be
ing a Jew, be looked for the Mes
siah, but one entirely different from
the Jesus who came, who was meek
and humble, preaching a gospel of
love and mercy and justice and pur
ity, denouncing the religious pretend
ers of the day. The people were
divided on him, and the majority fin
ally accomplished his death. They
did not want this man to reign over
them.
Zacheus was the chief publican,
I and he was rich, of course. Op
pression was the custom of the day
I in collecting the public revenues. He
had taken advantage of his oppor
tunity and feathered his own nest.
He had made his money largely by
dishonest means, though it may be
technically legal and safe from the
law's power. The wonderful Jesus
was passing through Jericho, and
Zacheus was very curious to see
him. The city was echoing with the
sVmts of those whom he had bless
ed in many ways. Zacheus was a
! short, small man and could not see
! above th crowd. So he ran ahead
and climbed a tree to get a good view
of Jesus. When Jesus cam" under
the tree where Zacheus was, He
looked up and addressed the curious
'little Jew, saying unto him to come
' down r.s lie wanted to go home with
him. A heart-to-heart visit in that
home with father, mother and chil
dren from Jesus wrought wonders
, then as it will do today. We do not
have to clean out some things before
he will come in. Let him come in
and some things will make haste to
! get of themselves. Jesus in the
! home is like the ark of the Lord in
the house of Obed Edom. The words

WARM WELCOME IS EXTENDED
THEM AND MANY EXPRESSIONS
OF COOD FEELING WERE
HEARD.
The Oklahoma booster special train
bearing the Oklahoma City delegation
1.30 strong, invaded the city last night
and were accorded a most cordial
reception by the Chamber of Com
merce and Business Men's associa
tion. Last night a reception and smoker
was tendered the visitors at the
Elks' Club, at which many express
ions of good feeling and good fellow
ship were heard from the visitors
anil from the local business men
alike.
President Mullen of the Chamber
of commerce was master of cerenuin
ies, and introduced the successive
speakers in his usual forceful manner.
The Oklahoma boosters were accom
panied by the first regiment band o"
Oklahoma City, which rendered a
short program before the beginning
of the evening's entertainment.
President Mullen, in behalf of the
Chamber of Commerce, the Husiness
Men's association, and the citizens
of the city, welcomed the visitors
and introduced as the first speaker
Kd S. Vaught, president of the Okla
homa City Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Vaught delivered a very pleasing
address in which he lauded the Okla
homa spirit and made an ea.nest
plea for unity in state affairs. He
closed his remarks by saying that
it was the duty of Oklahomans to
purchase goods In Oklahoma, prices
and delivery facilities being iqr.al.
Mr. Vaught's remarks were interrupt
ed by frequent applause.
Colonel Graves Leeper was next
called and kept the crowd in rood
spirits by one of his characteristic
speeches, replete with anecdotes of
the tie when Ardmore and Oklahoma
were young, and then introduced I.
M. Putnam, formerly of Oklahoma
City, but now of Ardmore, who ad
monished the visitors to look to their
laurels if they hoped to retain the
distinction of being the largest city
in the state.
Colonel Fred Fleming was called
upon for a few remarks, and recited
his experience in the insurance and
banking business in this state, and
said that the remarkable growth of
the bank deposits and the still more
marvelous increase in the scholastic
population of the state portended
great things for the future of Okla
homa. The hit of the evening was the ad
dress of Dr. Roach, pastor of the
First Methodist church of Oklahoma
City, and, as he termed it, spiritual
adviser to "the bunch." Dr. Roach
is one of the most eloquent men in
the state, and has the great gift of
being able to Inject real humor into
his lectures. He told of the wonders
that had been revealed to him since
coming to Oklahoma and praised the
spirit that had so far eliminated all
party lines that it was possible to
build such a magnificent common
wealth in bo short a time. Ir. Roach
was applauded to the echo at the con
clusion of his remarks.
H. H. Drown of this city and Wal
ter Lybrant, an attorney of Oklahoma
City, were the next speakers, Ifrown
for Ardmore bidding the visitors wel
come and assuring them that the in
terests of Oklahoma City were also
the interests of Ardmore. Mr. Ly
! brant, responding in kind, assured
the Ardmore citizens that Oklahoma
City was extremely proud of the spirit
that prevailed between the two cities,
and finished by begtMng the Ardmore
I Chamber of Commerce to "please
I not take any more of their live wires."
j Superintendent Richards of the
' Ardmore schools was called and told

the visitors ol uie spienum
system which was not only the pride
of every citizen of the city, but of
the state as well. 'Mr. Richards ad
monished the business men not to
lose sight of the welfare of the boys
and girls of the state, as its great
ness in the future would depend
