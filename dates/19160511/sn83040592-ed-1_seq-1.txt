ALL SHOT TO PIECES.
Our prices are all shot to pieces, and our reason for cutting prices
is because we sell for cash. We can turn our money two or three
times a week and why shouldn't we sell cheaply. We are not buck
ing credit merchants for our business and tneir business are different
propositions. There is no intelligent person who doesn't expect to
pay more when he trades on time. Arrange to pay cash and save a
week's groceries every thirty days. Some low prices: Flour, $2.50
to $3.20 per 100 pounds. Feed, we carry the best grades and sell
the cncapest. Meats, we have them all skinned on prices. See our
line of Fruits, Vegetables, Berries and Cookies. We have no com
petitors. Bring us your butter and eggs. We pay more.

Great Activity.
The Baxter-Quapaw Mining
District Has Come Back.
Special Correspondent.
The Baxter-Quapaw district,
which now reaches from a point
just across the Kansas-Oklahoma
state line south of Baxter, down
to and through Lincolnville,
thence sweeping west and north
west, taking in a wide stretch of
country and continuing into the
state of Kansas west of the Blue
Mound is todsy a great and exten
aive mineral zone. It is one con
tinual scene of activity drill rigs
everywhere shafts being sunk
all along the line mills being
constructed and completed in all
directions. The field presents
one great and continuous chain
of mine development. It would
require days of persistent effort
to visit each individual mining
proposition in this wonderfully
rich mining section, and give an
intelligent account of the devel
opments. Sectional reports are
necessary in order to report each
great individual interest.
The Lincolnville camp is a
"Come Back", and it came back
with one great stride. Six months
ago there were only one or two
operating plants in this once act
ive camp. Today there are from
one hundred to one hundred and
fifty operating places in this
camp. The developments are be
ing made mostly bv men of min
ing experience. This camp is
now being developed differently
from the manner of developments
which were carried on from 1904
to 1907 or a little later. During
that time it was a period of spec
ulation in Indian leases, chronic
mill building on a gigantic scale.
Most of the capital during that
period came from the north,
the northwest, west and south.
The capital came mostly through
the hands of inexperienced men
and was handled and applied
largely through inexperienced
men in charge of the active de
velopments. The Lincolnville
camp experienced its downfall in
1907 as a result of the panic, the
low price of ore and extravagant
and wanton mine management.
Conditions have changed. Today
developments are being made in
a businesslike, conservative and
miner-like way. Speculation and
plunging are no more in evidence.
Men of long experience from Jop
lin, Galena, Webb City and other
mining camps are making devel
opments and are now producing
ores in paying quantities, and at
splendid profits.
Go south of Baxter, which is
now the center of the two big
mining regions, one on the east
and northeast, and one on the
south and southwest, about four
miles and you will approach the
first zinc mill. This property is
owned by Dr. Boswell, Ed Miller
and associates. It is a paying
property. These gentlemen also
own the Redeagle mill, one mile
south of the Mohawk. The Red
eagle is a hummer; the profits
are big. Mr. Miller, the active
superintendent, is a miner of long
experience and his ability is un
questioned. Homer Seales, an active and
able miner of Webb City, has a
fine mill on the Abrams land just
west of the Mohawk mill. His
weekly sales reports show that be
is going to the good to the tune
of about one thousand dollars a
week in clear profits.
Substantial recovery is being
made on the old Omaha property
southeast of the Mohawk.
Dr. Berrvhill of Kusa. Okla..
is just getting into the ore body
in Us shaft south of the Omaha.
The Big Four northeast of Lin
colnville is showing up fine. The
ore body is rich and extensive.
Practical men are in charge and
its success is assured.
New derricks and smoke stacks
show continuous developments all
along the line for more than three
miles. It's an inspiring scene.
Mr. Bash, on the Ewart land
east of Lincolnville, is complet
ing a first class custom mill,
which will be a valuable addition
to the camp. Mr. Bash is an ex
perienced miner and knows what
the outcome of bis investment
will be.
Mr. Bnck Robeson, a Joplin
man of great mining ability, is
re-opening the old Kramer-Morse
mine, later known as the Hawk-
eye. Recent drilling on this pro
perty indicated a fine body of ore.
The Big Jack mill at Lincoln

doing well.
The old Sweeney mill is mak
ing a car of ore a week at a good
profit.
The Old Abe mine is being re
opened and this once famous pro-
oertv will again be put on tne
map. This is a good property.
- The old Mission mine is again
yielding up its rich ores under
the control of Mr. McNaugbton,
a long experienced man.
The Katy mine is constantly
turning out high grade ore at a
vnod orofit.
The Hannibal-St. Joe mill is
returning bier profits under the
efficient management of Theo
Hudson, who makes good in
mines.
E. L. Wright has leased the
Norton & Haskett land at Lin
colnville. Mr. Wright has been
mining a great number of years
and knows the business. He says
the Norton & Haskett land
richly mineralized and will come
to the front very quickly. Dr. H.
B. Savage. 01. Sparks and Mr.
Williams have leased the south
east 10 acres of this land frdm
Mr. Wright and the shaft is now
into ore. These gentlemen are
successful mine operators and will
be good men for the camp.
The Independence 10 acres of
this tract will be developed at
once. This 10 acres has four
drill holes and a shaft. The ore
body is rich, both in lead and
jack, and shows a 25 foot vein.
The Cherokee 10 on this tract has
six drill boles all snowing nne
ore.
The history of the Lincolnville
Sunnyside camp proves the con
tention of men of long mining ex
perience to be correct that lead
and zinc zones cannot be perman
ently worked out and permanent
ly abandoned.
The Lincolnville-Sunnyside
camp is a uome acir, ana is
come to stay.

Some Growth.
The news that our city has
gained more than four hundred
population within the past year
is not a surprise, but the figures
are none the less pleasing. And
the town can just as well grow a
thousand more within the next
year if some houses are built for
people to live in. There is a
growing demand for places to
live, and fifty bouses could be
rented in a week.

It is said, has been the cause of the " Spanish

to do anything, he usually says "tomorrow"

WE ARE A KEMBEJt OF THE
Half The Battle
Having nerve to tackle the job may be half the battle,
but having the ability to "make good" is the other and
larger half.
Anybody can make claims. "Delivering the goods" is
what wins success. We claim to have one of the soundest
and most reliable banks in this part of the state. We
claim we use every endeavor to treat our customirs court
eously. We claim that the welfare of our customers is our
first consideration but the claim is only the smaller half.
As to the larger half, ask any of our customers. We are
willing to risk our reputation on their judgment. They
will tell you we have "made good."
