Wheat prospects nro now esti
mated at 65 per cent compared
with an average, a decline o 1
per cent since the report issued hy
this department, April 1st. The
past -month with its excessive cold
rains has been most severe on the
wheat plant. Correspondents gen
erally note its unpromising condi
tion and in many sections of the
state a large percentage of the
original area seeded Avill be, or has
been plowed up and put to other
crops. The northwest section
seems to have suffered the most,
the present condition being but 48
per cent of an average. The dam
age 'reported by Hessian fly and
othe,r insects is of little conse
quence. As the original area
seeded was below a good average,
and deducting from .this the area
that will bo plowed up. Ohio's
wheat harvest this year will neces
sarily be far below a full average
crop.
The' unfavorable weather of the
past month has seriously retarded
farm work and spring crops will
go in late.
The township assessors' reports
show that last year the oats area
was 1,381,831 acres. The corre
spondents estimate that the area
seeded to oats this year compared
with lust is 95 per cent or 1,320,
038 acres. These figures are prob
ably low, as no doubt many corre
spondents have based their esti
mates on -the amount now sown,
without considering the many
fields intended for oats, but owing
to the unfavorable weather condi
tions it has been impossible to
peed. A greater part of the plowed
.up wheat area will be sown to
oats, although if the season con
tinues backward it will be planted
to corn.
In some sections clover and
alfalfa are reported as badly
frozen out.
Live stock generally is in good
condition and the losses during the
winter have been very slight.
The prospects for fruit is esti
mated at 88 per cent compared
with an average. Berries 92 per
cent. Many correspondents re
port peaches badly winter killed.

An exchange says that an ed
itor is often reminded that his
paper is read by a good many who
are not subscribers and the most
provoking thing about it is, that
those non-subscribers, non-paying
readers are the most critical. A
paper, of course, is a fair subject
of criticism, as is everything that
asks for public patronage, but it
is an exhibition of paralyzing gall
for one who never gives a cent to
wards the support of an enterprise
to constitute himself a censor of
the same.
Instead of furnishing munitions

Maurice, six-year-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Edward Puhl, of Mau
mee, was injured fatally Sunday
evening by an automobile driven

ney. The child dashed from behind a
tree into the path of tho automo
bile, in front of his home, on Dud
ley street. The wheels passed over

rescuers reached him. The parents
exonerated the driver of the car,
which was said to have been going
slowly when tho child, playing

There arc three other children,
two daughters and a son.

Louis D. Golin, of Toledo, the
driver of the automobile in which

lace's Garage at Perrysburg, ap
peared before Judge McClelland
and pleaded guilty to petit larceny
in connection with the theft of
auto supplies from the garage. He
was sentenced to serve twenty
days in the county jail and to pay
a fine of fifty dollars and costs and
to stand committed to jail until

ably ends the story of the so-called

1915. One of the members of the
auto pacty escaped and has never
been arrested. The other three are
