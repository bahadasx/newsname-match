(iiiifiisiiin of Aiinies Caused Error ill
Mlssniiriiin Article.
The Missourian was in error jes
t rda in stating that Frederick Nied
crmever, a Univcrsit student of Co
lumbia, was one of two joung men
who as a lark, took C. W. Furtney's
i ar from the street in front of the Co
lumbia Theater and drove it around
the block
Mr Niederme.vcr was in no way
concerned in the prank, nor was he
summoned to the police station. The
error was due to a confusion of his
name with that of another student.
Of course there was no hint In the
Missourian account that the episode
was anv thing but a prank: no
"charge" was made against Mr Nied-
criiiejer or an body else.

of the indoor meet was 45 to 40, Mis

Vice-President Predicts Wid
er Field of Usefulness for
Organization.
A CommerLi.il Club so thoroughl
oigauized that it will caie for every
public aLtivit or Columbia, will
evoutiiall li the goal attained b the
Columbia Commercial Club. This was
the forecast of W I.. Nelson, vice-
president, in liis talk at the club's
weekly luncheon today
The reports of the membership cam
paign committees were. read. The
subscriptions to th support of the
club in this campaign have been'$l,
2S0, which is $2I." more than the total
subscription receipts of the club last
ear.
"The committees in this campaign
have found a very diflerent spirit
among the- business men toward the
Commercial Club," Mr. Nelson said.
"The average citicn is rorgetting
petty grievances toward the tlub and
is giving his support Eventually,
tills organization will be competent
to take care of every public activity
of the town, will have a budget Ss
tem for raising and distributing funds
and will have the support of ever
merchant because he will sj the
benefits to him. We must impress
every business man with the idea that i
he owes it to the people to make this
a better town to live in. That is what
the organization works for."
W. B Now ell, chairman of one of
the subscription committees, said he
felt that the general opinion of the
Commercial Club had improved 200 to
300 per cent over last ear. Other
committees reported gi eater readiness
of people to become members of the
club
A plan to divide the work of the
Commercial Club uniUr three olhcers,
the president, the vice-president and
trasiirer, was sketched in a chart and
will probably be adopted.
Under the president is the division
of public afTairs, subdivided into com
mercial development, legislation edu
cation, recreation, health and chari
ties. I'nder the vice-president is the
division of business development, sub
divided into industrial, retail trade
and transportation, agriculture and
roads, publicity and conventions. The
treasurer has charge of organization
affairs, including membership, pub
licity, budget, entertainment and pro
gram. MtltlVKS EI!LV FOK MEET
