Rapidly Southward Service
with General. Obregon was set for 10
o'clock this morning at El Paso.
Secretary Baker said there was
nothing to confirm border reports
that General Scott had served an ul
timatum on General Obregon for a
final answer upon acceptance " or, re
jection of the tentative protocol. It
was expected here that General Ob
regon would- . present counter pro
posals in writing, particularly regard
ingflxing a date for ultimate with
drawal of American forces.'
The war department had no report
early today on another incursion into
American territdi-y at Blocker's
Ranch, near Eagle Pass., Tex. There
also were no official advices-ithat
American troops had actually crossed
the border in the Big Bend region,
although 1 it was believed probable
that some had done so.
American consuls throughout .Mex
ico .have been, instructed to again call
attention of Americans to the state
department's repeated warnings that
this government regards their pres
ence there ,as Undesirable. The last
census of Americans in Mexico,' taken
by . the state department six weeks
ago, showed less than 3,000 through
out' the country.' Most of them 'are
near Mexico City and extreme east
and west coasts, few remaining in
Chthuahua and Sonora. ' ,
Dublic places them at about 1,000, of
which 400 were killed. These figures
included soldiers, insurgents and civil
ians... v "
The fact is noted, in Dublin that
since. the insurrection 'there has been
an increase inr the rate of recruiting
there, fi Even while the controversy
over the causes and manner of hand
ling the insurrection is still in prog
ress, efforts are being made to reach
a. compromise on the home rule ques
tion. - Those who most, desire this are
urging that Lord Harding, after he
has concluded . his inquiry into the dis
turbances, shall be appointed Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, i It is . believed
that a diplomat would be more likely
to bring the two parties together than
would a politician. There are rumors
in parliamentary circles that negotia
tions of - some kind are being arranged
and that Sir Edward Carson and John
Redmond,' the leaders of the two par
ties, are concerned with them. - 7 -

SUED ONCE P.10RE
Gave Mortgage on Brass
Co.'s Property as Security
$10,000 Asked.
The Bridgeport 'Brass Co. today
brought suit for $10,000 against J.
Harry Crossley alleging that Crossley
had given the company's property at
Housatonic avenue and Grand street
as security for a loan, when he knew
at the 'time he did not own the prop
erty. Papers in the action, which is
returnable to the superior court, were
served today. All the furniture in
Crossley's office n the Security build
ing and all property in which, claims
to have . an interest have been at
tached. It is claimed that on April 23, l"9l0
F. H. Lyon sold to Crossley, , who was
acting as agent for the Brass Co., the
Housatonic avenue property on which
the company's plant is now located.
In 1912 Crossley gave quit claim deeds
transferring the parcels to the com
pany. On April 2 3, 1914 while the com
pany owned the property Crossley is
alleged to have sought a loan of $5,000
from Arthur Lieberum, of this city.
He gave a mortgage on the Housa
tonic avenue. property, although he
knew he did not own it. On April 18
last, Lieberum brought suit against the
company to foreclose thelproperty be
cause Crossley had not paid the $5,000.
This actio-1 involves the Brass Co. in
litigation to establish claim to its own
land an-1 will result in great expense.
This is only one of the numerous
legal tangles it. which Crossley has re
cently become involved.

COMLEY PREPARES
REPORT TO COUNCIL
Beautiful Waterfront Drive
Possible when Park Boule
vard jis Completed..
The point of land fronting on Ash
Creek on which St. Mary's-by-the-Sea
is located is not the property of the
city, or of Paul Spofford Pearsall, but
is a "public Ibeach," according to the
conclusion of City Attorney William
11. Comley, Jr. '
The city has no rights in the prop
erty nor has any individual according
to the city attorney. As public prop
erty it belongs to the. state. It is a
public beach such as the beach in
the town of Orange, which by a re
cent decision of the supreme court
was declared a "public ibeach," a prop
erty in which no individual has any
especial right hut in which all- resi
dents of the state have common
rights.
Years ago when the section in the
vicinity of the beach was part of the
town of Fairfield, persons from Dan
bury and the smaller .towns in the
northern part of the county,, made
frequent visits to this beach in "the
summer time. Here they enjoyed
bathing, caught fish and crabs and
dug clams, i This custom had been
carried on from earliest history of
that section down to within recent
years. It is this custom, which in
the opinion of the city attorney makes
tha tsection a public beach. Citizens
of the town of Fairfield had always
looked, upon it as such and it , seems
to have been so regarded so until re
cently when Mr. Pearsall set up claim
to the section and put up a fence,
shutting off the beach and closing the
road over Grover'sSshiU. , s
The action of Mr. Pearsall aroused
residents of Black Rock and recently
Mr. Pearsall was. compelled to open
the highway again. That there is a
highway "Vver Grovers hill which can
not be (Closed to the public. City At
torney Comley is certain, but just
where the highway runs is a matter
of doubt. This highway is shown
on; the' earliest maps of " the section
but, its layout has been changed sev
eral times. i
Mr. Pearsall, however, has. a fence
on either side of the highway and. - a
gate which he . has given orders to
have closed one day a year. By this
he hopes to hold title to the highway
by claiming that it is not a public
way open to travel all year round.
The fact that his title to this prop
erty, has been denied by the city at
torney has ' caused Mr. Pearsall to
make effort to establish perfect title
to all his property holdings in that
vicinity. Tuesday in the town clerk's
office here was filed deeds' and trans
fers from John W. Sterling and John
B.-Gawer, executors f the-estate of
Thomas W. Pearsall, -his father, to
Morris, Pol-linger of the following'
property in and about the Grover's hill
road.
First parcel All that certain piece
or parcel, containing four acres, more
or less, bounded on the north by land
now or late of Thomas Smith, on the
east by the land now or late of Jon
athan Thome, and Thomas W. Pear
sall, on the south by the highway and
on the west in part 'by land now or
late of Jonathan Carr, and in part by
i the land now or late of John OlarK
son. , This land was conveyed to
Thomas W. Pearsall by a deed from
Samuel E. Penfield and others, on
uly 26, 1882 and recorded August
7, 1882, in the town clerk's office.
Second parcei---A . plot , containing
three and one-half acres conveyed to
Thomas W. Pearsall from Hoxanna
Penfteld on September 24th 18?1,
bounded on the south by the highway,
on the west by another piece of land
formerly belonging to Thomas W.
Pearsall, the first parcel described)
oiwthe north hy land of Thomas Smith
and on the east by a line parallel to
the eastern boundary of the first par
cel. Third parcel Three acres conveyed
to Thomas W. Pearsall from Cornelia
A. and Carrie E. Peiifield. Bounded by
the property of George F. Gilman
and Harriet V. S. Thome.
Fourth parcel Right of way in
common with Jonathan Thorne, Jr.,
extending "from Beach avenue at a
point opposite the dividing line "be
tween the first and second parcels de
scribed above, southerly about 800
feet to a junction with the first par
cel.' .
Quit claim deed for this last piece is
given by John W. Sterling and John
A. Garver as trustees of the wiH of
the late Thomas W. Pearsall for Paul
Spofford Pearsall and his sister, Char
lotte Pearsall Walker.
With the same deeds and transfers
were deeds and transfer of the prop
erty from Morris Pol linger to Paul S.
Paersall. The consideration was $9,000.
Morris Pollinger is a clerk in a real
estate office. Wilmot Wheeler of the
Bridgeport Land & Title Co., who
conducted the transaction, said that it
was purely to clear the title to the
property Mr. Pearsall holds at Gro
ver's hill.
City Attorney Comley says that all
the property south of the highway
over Grover's hill and the beach there,
is a public beach. By recent vote of
the common council he was instructed
to establish title for the city to the
property and take the necessary steps
to. open it to the" public and turn it
over to the care of the park board as
part of the park system.
If the park board desires to take
charge pf the bach and the land ad
joining and lay , out walks, trees,
shrubbery, etc., it is doubtful if the
state government will object but At
torney Comley says he cannot claim
the land for the city nor can the board
of aldermen, or anyether officials of

RIZZO RELATES
OWN STORY OF
SLAYING UNCLE
Collapses in Paroxysm of
Tears As He Tells of
Mother's Wrong.
VENGEANCE IN HEART,
FEIGNED FRIENDSHIP
Years Since Palermo Inci
dent Failed to Temper
Heat of Anger.
Inquest into the death of Angelo"
Rizzo, shot by his nephew, Michael
Rizzo, as the victim was. entering his
home, 173 Sterling street, Monday
night, has revealed one of the strang
est and most interesting crimes ever
staged in this country.
That blood heritage, filial devotion
and impulsiveness of the Southern
European , races may not be overcome
by one generatioil in the great Amer
ican melting pot, were among the fea
tures disclosed in the frank confes
sion of the young slayer who sought
to tell In person the vunique story to
Coroner John J. Phelan.
Tradition, impressionistic stories of
wrong, cool deliberation to murder
f olowed by - qualms because of the
blood relation that were finally over
come by sudden impulse, and the pleas
of the dying man for succor from the
mortal wounds that were received by
him without premonition of the cause
were other features that stood . out
prominently In the testimony given.
The story of young' Kizzo, still a
minor, which supplemented the story
told the pelice by hiir yesterday and
was again related by witnesses at the
inquest and which caused him at. its
conclusion to collapse in a paroxysm
of tearr sobs and prayers', to , his
"Dear Mother," was dramatically, told
by the prisoner to the clanking chant
of a pair of handcuffs left, dangling t
his" wrist. ' ' V
SUzzo- said that on ''the night of the
tragedy he had felt lonesome for a
brother, in this city, who was, working
at the Remington Arms & Ammuni
tion Co.'s plant. He -went over to the
lodgings of his uncle. His uncle, was
eating. He was asked to Join to some
spaghetti. Having been taught that
it was impolite to stay in a room
where others were eating without
Joining them, and having, just com
pleted a plate of ice cream at a near
by store, he refused the offer and In
timated that he would, take a walK. -
His unclef asked by the comely sis
ter -xf his landlady to get- a box. of
candy and some flowers for her fore
woman - the shop, said he vould Join
his nephew.
Twenty-eight hours before ' that
time, Salvatore Mazzetta, a companion
who Was -alleged by the prisoner . to
have tried previously to kill his uncle,
had recalled the fact that the uncle
dared not go to Syracuse) and f ac
Michael's father, whom the uncle had
wronged years ago.
This had inflamed the youth to such
an extent that he had decided to kill
Angelo Rizzo and he took from his
drawer a revolver he had bought for
protection only. Though the sight
of .his uncle had always resurrected
the spectre of his dead mother be
fore his eyes, yet the devotion of the
uncle to the' nephew with whomhe
worked constantly in the Textile
works, had each time deterred him
from the shooting.
.Uncle and nephew . walked down
Congress to Main street. The uncle
was chatting - amiably and apparently
young Rizzo was unperturbed. -They
bought the 'box of candy, which was
under the victim's arm when he was
shot. They sought flowers at Main
and Bank streets, but found the shop
closed. They then - walked together
to a store above the Lyric theatre.
They walked back to the house, Rizzo
still intent upon killing his uncle.
Even to the door of. the uncle's house
they .walked without a hint of his
doom being . given to the victim.
As they said goodbye and the elder
Rizzo turned to go in the house he
received his mortal wounds from be
hind. -
"I could not help It," shouted the
prisoner as he concluded his state
ment to Coroner Phelan.
"For 28 hours my mind was in a
whirl. I wantd -to kill him all the
time. . I left my , house with that In
tention, but I could not do it on the
street. Even to the very end of
the walk I could not do it. As he
turned to go in the house ; I said to
myself, it must -be done. I must re
venge my poor dead mother. Oh! my
mother! my mother!"
"I have never done anything wrong
before in my life. I could not help
It- I only saw the wrong that had
been done to her and which I thought
all Bridgeport knew-" ,
The crime of murder for which Riz-'
zo will undoubtedly be charged in the
