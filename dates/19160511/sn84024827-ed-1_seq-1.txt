CARRANZA'S SILENCE

First Chiefs Answer On New
Terms Holds Up Confer

tial Withdrawal
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, May 10. Negotiations
over the American troop dispositions
in Mexico made no progress today.
General ObreCjn awaited word from
General Carranza as to the course he
is to pursue and when instructions
did not come, a conference which had
been postponed for this morning, wa9
set back until tonjrrow.
Failing in their efforts to have a
definite date of . withdrawal sot, it
wes reported tonight that the Mexi
can government may next try to
have part of the American troops
taken out at jnce, leaving the re
tnander to cooperate with the forces
of the de facto 'government in the
pursuit of the Villista groups.

lieve the size of General Pershing's
army is out of all proportion to its
mission the extermination of a few
hundred bandits and that a much
smaller l'jrce would, answer the
purposei A, partial withdrawal, it te
argued, would have a good political
influence in Mexico.
In the absence of new proposals,
the situation as it now stands is as
fol.'jws:
, General Scott and Funston are un
alterably opposed to any change in
the tentative agreement which sets
a date for American withdrawal from
Mexico.
However, the American conferees
are patiently listening to all proposals
the Mexican minister of war may
make while waiting for him to realize
that the intentions of the American
government are immovable. '
In the meantime, General Obr?pon's
proposal for a j"jint troops patrol of
the border should be given considera
tion as to who was responsible to
Washington. Frankly the American
conferees doubt if the de facto eov-l
ernment can muster sufficient forces! "If the Republican convention is re
to form a patrol of the sort outlined j sponsive to the patriotic spirit that

ERICAN NOTE PLEASES.
BERLIN. May 10 The Amer-
lean reply to the German note
was delivered by Ambassador
Gerard to the foreign office at
one o'clock this afternoon.
With the presentation of the
note the German submarine
controversy is regarded here an
settled. Germany holds that
its orders to submarine com
manders were issued without
strings or conditions.
Both the Lokal Anzeiger and
the Zeitung am Mittag regard
the note as acceptable to Ger
many. The Zeitung am Mittag
commenting on the American
answer under- the caption
"Wilson'3 final word," says
that the German-American
crisis with its danger of a rup
ture is now a thing of the
past. The paper is not alto-
gether pleased with the man-
aer of expression hut says
that is of minor importance.
"The main thing," it adds.
"Is that the good relations of
two countries continue to the
disappointment of all Ger
many's enemies, who will
doubless try to interpret' the
answer as hinting that a rup
ture is postponed only tempo
rarily. Progressives Wish . to Dictate

(By Review Leased Wire.).
NEW YORK. May 10. The Progres
sive party will not insist upon the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for
President if the Republicans will
name a candidate at Chicago who
sands for progressive principles and
is able to put them through," accord
ing to a statement made here tonight
I by Geo. W. Perkins, after a meeting
of the executive committee or the.
Progressive National Committee.
'We of course are for Colonel
i Roosevelt." Mr. Perkins asserted,
("and shall suggest his name to the
I Republicans. If they reply that they
wilr not agree on the Colonel, we shall
psk them to name their man, whrt
ought to be as nearly unanimous a
choice as our man is. We are will
ing to be reasonable for the sake of
harmony."
Mr. Perkins' statement supplement
ed one issued by the executive com-
m it tee in which it was said:
ders than ours.
In this turning point in world his-
have stood, and will follow only a
leader who we know stands for them
and is able to put them through. We
are for peace but not for "peace at
any price.
"Reports from the progressive or
ganizations throughout the country
show that the American people have
become impatient with leaders who
hold that comfort, prosperity and ma
terial welfare are above honor, self
sacrifice and patriotism, that we need
reawakening of our elder conscience
of our belief In those things that our
country and our flag stand for; that
our people are seeking a leadership
of the highest order and most cour

Complete delegations from all the
states will attend the Progressive
tional Convention, it was announced.
The total number of delegates will be
upward of 1,000.
After the forenoon session of the
committee. George W. Perkins enter

several days with the details
of his military duties to attend
to this.
The governor-elect of Sonora
was not greeted with particular
cordiality in Aeua Prieta. it is
reported in Mexican official '

fact that five of his personal
friends from Mexico City came
