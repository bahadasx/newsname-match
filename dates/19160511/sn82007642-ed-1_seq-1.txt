THE PRFSIDENT. '
Frooi Senator Slinmoni Address at
the Democratic State Convention.
I do not know what may hap
pen jqjonr relations with the bel
ligerent nations o! the old world,
than I know what will happen in
our relations With Mexico, but I
do know that nothing will be
done to disturb and. disrupt our
friendly relations with the gov
ernment of these' belligerent na
tions which can he avoided with
due regard to the honor and dig
nity of this government and the
rights of the American people;
and I know that neutrality will
be maintained and our peace pre
served if it can be done without
sacrificing these high interests or
abandoning pur duty to human
ity and civilization.
I know this sentiment repre
sents the hopes and the prayers
of the sorely tried man in the
White House. He hears, but he
isunmoved by-tbeclamorof those
who wantjis,to lend ourselves to
the caule W one side or the oth
er. He bears, but is unmoved by
the clamor' of those who want us
to plunge into this maelslrom of
war ana carnage. His great
mind and his patriotic heart are
centered in one great purpose
namely, to know what his duty is
and to do it. '
Let no man suspect him in
whatever he may do in this be
half as acting from any motive
other than that of duty; and let
no man believe that he will be
swerved frbin the line of duty as
God giv&j-bim light to see it and
tndersanjd it,
If you want a "War Lord" you
will not' find one in him. If you
want v molly-coddle pacificist,
you will not find one in him. He
is not moved by the militancy of
the one or the-rhapsodies of the
.other. He is a plain, direct, res
olute manj with a clear vision,
steady -.nerve and stout heart,
living always in, the fear of God,
beutupon serving his country,
humanity and civilization re-gardless-of
criticism and aggran
disement, personal, political or
Otherwise, So far as clear vision,
: mature-jiicigfement, unfaultering
loyaltyund patriotism can pro
tect us, we are safe in his hands.
- The President does not want
war. He will do everything that
a great nation and a Christian
people Ought to do, to avoid it,
but he wants us to be prepared if
the necessity comes to protect
our country and defend our rights
wherever .attacked or called in
question, upon land or Bea. He
wants the world to know that we
know our rights and are able xnd
determined to protect and defend
them.
He is for preparedness to pre
serve peace and not for prepared
ness to make, war, unless it is ab
solutely necessary. His great
ambition is to serve men, not to
' kill them. To elevate humanity,
not to. brutalize it But he is
keenly jealous of the honor, dig
nity and glory of his count ry and
. the rights of its people.
' Not only the President but the
American people are in favor of
preparedness. This is no longer
an issue. But there is an issue,
and an acute issue. That issue
is, Peace against War! Upon
that issue the President stauds
for peace and against war, and
behind him stands the great Dem
' ocratic party, upon .whose ban
ner in the coming campaign will
float the inscription: "Prepared
ness, not for War,butforPeaoel"
To keep this country at peace
with the world in this world-mad
. maelstrom of war is an achieve
ment which if it be accomplished
will write the name of Woodrow
Wilson high android among the
world's immortals! - J
Mr. Lacy Replies ti Mr. linney.
Replying to criticisms of Mr.
Frank A. Linney on his adminis
tration of the State Treasurer's
office, State Treasurer B. R. Lacy
makes it plain that the attack
is based on what he terms "a
long since discredited report of
discredited New York auditors,
who audited my department in
1904.
"Tbw principal contention is,"
says Mr. Lacy "that I carried for
tho years 1912 and 1913 aver
age balances of state funds of
$300,000 to $500,000 in banks
without interest, and' was at the
same time borrowing money for
the state and paying interest on
it These statements are based
on the findings of" the auditors
above referred to, which were
incorrect as to the aradunt of
the balance shown on the books,
and totally inco'rrect as to the
conclusions drawn from them,
for the following reasons:
"The book balance shown on
the books of the State Treasurer
do not at any time show the ac
tual cash balance in bank. 1 car
ry actual accounts-with the lo
cal banks in every section of the
state where a State institution
is located for the convenience of
the patrons of such institutions.
If 1 send $100,000 to a bank at
Morganton, for illustration, that
bank begins paying the money
out as proper vouchers are pre
sented it for collection. My
books will continue to show bal
ance of $100,000 on deposit with
the bank until it send in to me
for cancellation a month's ac
cumulation of vouchers paid. A
situation similar to this exists
with reference to funds carried in
New York banks for payment of
interest on the bonded debt of
the State, which amounts to
$400,500 per year. Interest cou
pons paid by them are never sent
in to me under 30 days after they
are paid, and in some instances
in more than two months, and
my books show, as balance on
hand, the money that has in this
way been paid out 30 to 60 days
before. These New York accounts
are not carried direi-tly in . the
name of the State, . but through
one of the Ka'eigh banks, which
accounts for the showing made
of balance carried with the Ral
eigh bank. These accounts have
for 40 years been carried in the
name of a Raleigh bank as pro
tection to the funds of the State
from bond schemers of the But
ler type, who are always on the
lookout for some means of forc
ing the State to pay those old
fraudulent bonds, and has pro
ven a wise policy."
Mr. Lacy states that Mr. Lin
ney 's conclusions take no account
of the auditor's warrants and
that in insisting on the State col
lecting interest balance in the
banks, he is advocating some
thing that has already been pro
vided for by the Legislature of
1915 and is now in effect
"One-sixth of the past three
years and four mouths of my ad
ministration," hecontinues, "for
eign auditors have been in my
offices auditing my books and it
is not charged that a single dot
lar coming into my hands has
not been accounted for or that
the State has lost one penny du
ring my administration.
"My books," he odds, "are
public property, and no objec
tion will be raised to Mr. Lin
ney's party if he desires to have
them audited. In fact. I have
gotten used to this auditing bus
iness, and feel lonesome without
having auditors around." The

FOR FLETCHER'S '
CASXO.RIA
Dindcratic Platform.
After a comprehensive review
of the past record of the Demo
cratic record in the state and na
tion, especially during the four
years just gone, the convention
in Raleigh adopted the following
significant planks as the main
stay of the platform for the next
four years:
1st The development of pub
lic education has been the chief
pride of the Democratic party,
and nothing less than an educa
ted citizenship must be the goal
of our continued and untiring ef
forts. Our public school term
has been increased to a point
much beyond the Constitutional
requirements, and we are build
iug school houses at the rate of
one for every day that passes.
2nd. . The conservation of pub
lie health is now recognized as a
problem demanding -consideration
of all enlightened govern
ments. " We rejoice in tbd splen
did progress made by our state
in combating disease among our
people, in reducing our death
rate, in increasing the Bum total
of health, happiness and efficien
cy of our citizens, and in estab
lishing a justifiable record of
bealthfulness as compared with
other states of the' Union. We
advocate a continuance and a
strengthening of the humane
policy now in force in this state
for the protection of the public
health, and the eradication of
preventable diseases.
3rd. The construction and
maintenance of improved public
roads is one of the greatest prob-
ems in the development of our
state, and particularly in the
development of rural communi
ties. Four years ago there were
only 5,000 milesof modern roads
in the state. Today we have
15,000 miles of such roads, and
every day sees the mileage ex
tended. We pledge our party to
a policy of sympathetic aid and
encouragement to road building
in this state.
4th. We must ever be mindful
of the fact that the state derives
its strength from its toiling citi
zens and its rural communities,
and we pledge the party to a con
tinuance of the policy of encour
aging the best development of
the rural community. Under
democratic rule the conditions of
country life in respect to schools
and roads have been vastly im
proved while by means of the
State Department of Agriculture,
the A. and M. College and Farm-
Life schools intelligent and help
ful direction has been given to
our farmers, the result of which
is manifest in the tremendous in
crease in the variety and value of
the farm products. It is a mat
ter of fact that the value of our
farm products doubled from 1900
to 1910 and it has again doubled
in the last six years. We favor
legislation providing for the in
corporation, supervision and
control of warehouses for the
storing of farm products, in or
der to facilitate the proper mar
keting of such products.
5th. Every enterprise looking
to the investment of capital and
employment of labor should be
fostered and encouraged by the
state. We pledge, not only to
citizens of this state, but to citi
zens of other states, that all cap
ital invested in legitimate enter
priRes in North Carolina, wheth
er foreign or domestic, shall have
the equal and friendly protection
of our laws in their observance,
and will be hnld equally amenda
ble to our laws in their violation.
Cth. We reaffirm our confi
dence in the wisdom and justice
of the suffrage amendment to our
state constitution. Under its in
fluence we have had freedom from
race issues, and both races have
enjoyed contentment and pros-
VIOLETS.
The violets again little wet vi
olets, aud there is the clean, sweet
breath of Spring. One would lift
his head and drink deep taste
this newness, this grateful fresh
ness that is about. There is a
quicker leap of life, and nature
seems to stir with a kind of ten
derness. There is the deeper glow
on the faces of children easier
happiness on a tiny, nestling face
girlhood conies to outward
whiteness again the cool, crisp
sign of Spring. And in all is the
subtle charm of violets little hu
man, tremulous things, gentle a
over's whisper, pure as purity.
Restful, quaint little flowers, too
simple, appealing -fliowers to
ay on a baby that has died to
give as seemly tribute to woman
hood, to press against the face
as easement for a tired heart
such a dear peaceful little flower,
all alone in flower land emblems
of the world's best, and waiting
to mock a false face or adorn the
beauty that comes from the soul.
With every return of spring and
the "violets again" there's add
ed beauty to the literary gem of
Isaac Erwin Avery's reprinted a
bove. A word taken away, it
would be incomplete; to add an
other thought would be super
fluous. Morganton has the proud
distinction of having given to
the world for even a brief life's
span the late lamented author of
this beautiful little masterpiece.
tlis memory will live as long as
the violets come again, for in
beauty of expression there are
few equals to "The Violets" in
prose or poetry. Morganton

Bud Fisher's Snog Income.
"Bud" Fisher, creator of "Mutt
and Jeff." is the highest paid car
toonist on earth. He gets $150,
090 a yenr for making the Amer
ican people chuckle which is
twice what the President gets for
shaping their National destiny.
Furthermore, Fisher is troubled
neither by international compli
cations nor by office-seekers. His
office is in his hat.
For drawing six comic strips
a week for forty-eight weeks a
year th is genial Irimorist receives
$78,000, John N. Wheeler ex
plains in the American Magazine
for May. The rest of his income
is made up from vaudeville en
gagements, .which bring him a
thousand dollars a week, the
proceeds from five 'Muttand Jeff'
shows and animated cartoons;
the sale of an annual "Mutt and
Jeff" book, post cards, plaster
figures, buttons and other nov
el ties.
On an average it takes Fisher
two hours to draw hisdaily com'
ic strip for which he is paid at the
rate of $270 an hour, or nearly
$5 a minute.
Fisher is the Midas of mirth.
His marked success has done
more than any other influence to
lift the level of American cartoon
ist's salary. These accomplish
ment's, startling in themselves,
become almost bewildering whn
you consider that he is only thir
ty .years old and never took a
drawing lesson in his life. Ex.
perity. The hazard to its valid
continuance makes it imperative
for the public good that Demo
cratic supremacy in thestate be
maintained.
B1CKETT AND UNNEY.
Mr. E. G. Kestler, a Republi
can, of Concord, delivers himself
thusly in the Greensboro News,
on the candidates for guberna
torial honors in North Carolina:
"It is almost a certainty now
that Mr. Bickett and Mr. Linney
will be the opposing candidates
for Governor in our State this
year. It is true, the the cam
paign will be upon an elevated
plane and be one conducted by
men of high intellects and char
acters. Both gentlemen are rich
ly endowed by nature and train
ing with all the graces of the true
orator and both are logicians of
no mean pretensions and in their
leadership the principles of gov
ernment and the opposing poli
cies of their parties will receive
the treatment of the master. The
historic campaign of Vance and
Set tle will be enacted over again
with the result problematic. Rhet
oric and rounded periods will
float upon the zephyrs. Demos
thenese and Cicero will lose their
charms and fade away before the
coming heroes of a new era.
"From the snowcapped moun
tain peaks to the sounding sea,
from South Carolina to the
Mother of Presidents, the scenes
will be those long remembered in
history and long chanted by the
firesides. A memorable campaign
is about to be horn. By such a
campaign the world of letters will
be brightened, the catalogue of
puns and true pathos will be en
larged, the political atmosphere
will be surcharged with dynam
ics, and the voters will be edified,
electrified and many of them will
be transfused from the Donkey
to the Elephant and vice-versa.
"The new dispensation that will
be thus ushered in will spell great
things for our Commonwealth.
It will elevate the political arena,
centralize public thought, open
politics and principles and carve
the names of the two leaders in
letters of gold high on the arch
of fame, and perhaps weave their
virtues and their merits deep in
to the hearts of i heir countrymen
and the partisans."
