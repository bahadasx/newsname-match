South Sioux City thirteen telephone
and trolley poles were hurled to the
ground. In falling.the poles carried
down the wires of the'Bell Telephone
company and feed wires of the Crys
tal lake and Dakota City electric
railway. As a result traffic on the
road was paralyzed for a time.
Temporary repairs enabled cars to
reach a pojnt about half a mile from
the South Sioux City terminal last
evening. The telephone service be
tween Sioux City, Omaha and Nor
folk will be hampered until the poles
have beeii reset. In Sioux City the
only damage was to the telephone,
companies. Lines were down in va
rious parts of the city as a result of
the storm. At first it was feared
that fruit blossoms had been dam-
aged by the hail, but investigation
in orchards showed that few blos
soms had been destroyed. Most of
the fruit trees have reached full
bloom.

terday experienced a touch of real
summer weather did not realize that
just thirty-five years ago mammoth
ice cakes filled the Missouri river at
this point from bank to bank,"result
ing in one of the most disasterous
floods in the history of the city.
Some of the older residents grew
reminiscent of the big flood of 1881,
when all of the cities along the big
stream, even as far south as Kansas
City and St. Joseph," Mo., were
threatened with destruction.1 G. W.
Kingsnorth, one of the early mayors
of Sioux City, who now is in charge
of the tollhouse on the combination
bridge, yesterday told of 'the high
waters and the scare which gripped
the people of the city for several
days. The flood did the rriost dam
age on the Nebraska side of the riv
er, the town of Covingtonn being
Eartially wiped out. Seven or eight
ouses at one time were almost com
pletely under water.- In Sioux City
the flood did its greatest damage in
the vicinity of Court street. The
flood was caused by the breaking of
ice -gorges at Chamberlain, S. D.,
and in the Redwood hills. It was
over a week before the river fell to
its normal level, according to Mr.
Kingsnorth , The flood caused great
er damage at Council Bluffs than,
it did here. The waters there
were crowded up into the main
streets of the city and the damage
to property was enormous. Most of
the people living along the river be
tween here and. Council bluffs were
given warning of the impending
danger, but despite this a number
of lives were lost. A half dozen
houses were carried away on the
high waters,

Sioux City Journal, 5: A complete
denial of the allegations contained
in the application for an injunction
restraining the supervisors of drain
age district No 2 of Dakota county,
Neb., from digging a ditch which
will flow into Jackson' lake, is made
by Judge R. E. Evans in his answer
in the United States district court
at Omaha. The next step in the le
gal battle over the construction of
the ditch will be a hearing before
Judge J. W. Woodrough,' whose ap
pointment to the federal bench re
cently wasconfirmed by the senate.
In his answer Judge Evans contends
that the land ownerd who have ask
ed for the restraining order are not
within the limits of the drainage
district, and that their property will
not be damaged by the digging of
the ditch. The answer further as
serts that the plans of the improve
ment show that the ditch will be
able to takecare of all storm waters
and there will be no overflow of the
lake caused by the influx of the
water. Practically every allegation
of the plaintiffs, except the owner
ship of the land, is denied in the
answer. It is expected that Judge
Woodrough will fix a date for a
hearing in the course of the next
week. The hearing will take to
Omaha about twenty witnesses who
will be called by both sides A
Chautauqua, tc commence about the
middle of June and to be conducted
two afternoons and two evenings a

plans outlined at a meeting hold in
Knowlton & Manning's hall at South
Sioux City last evening are carried
out.. More than-thirty people, rep
resenting Sipux City, South Sioux

dition to those of the chautauqua.

Sioux City Journal, 4: Miss Bes
sie Hughes, of Homer, Neb., who
has been the guest of Miss Edna
Morrison, 3221 Orleans evenue, has
returned home .... Provided the Bur
lirigton railroad can buy its electrici
ty from South Sioux City it will
erect a large coal hoist at Laketon,
near Crystal lake. Cottages at Crys
tal lake will bo lighted by electricity
if the South Sioux City council
grants the application of lake resi
dents to bjy the current from the
municipal plant. . . .Constitutionality
of the Iowa law under which search
warrants are obtained was upheld b
County Attorney 0. T. Naglestad
and Assistant County Attorney J. W.
Kindig yesterday afternoon in argu
ments before Justice D. C. Brown
ing in opposition to the motion of
council for the Intersiate Transpor
tarson company to quash the search
warrant on which $1,000 worth of
beer, whisky and wines was taken
from its warehouse. The county's
attorneys contend that the notation
on the search warrant that the case
was in police court instead of a jus
tice court was surplusage. They
further contended that the issuauce
of the warrant by the justice was in
accordance with the law. They de
clared a police court could not issue
a search warrant. Justice Brown
ing, after hearing the arguments,
took the case under advisement.
He probably will make his ruling be
fore Saturday. Howard a. Baron,
attorney for the express firm, con
tended that the search warrant pro
ceedings were irregular. Barney
Kopel, manager of the company,
filed an appearance in the case. The
seized liquor now, however, is out of
the jurisdiction of the Woodbury
county courts, having been returned
to Jackson, Neb., by the transporta
tion company, which obtained it on
a writ of replevin. Attorney Bar
pn not only attacked the regularity
of the search wurrant proceedings,
but he also attacked the jurisdiction
of the justice court. Ho argued
that the affidavit of Rev. C. N. Mc
Millan, of the Woodbury County
Antisaloon league, to obtain the war
rant, was contrary to the provisions
of the code. He further held that
when Rev. McMillan applied for the
warrant, Justice Browning failed to
examine the antisaloon league offi
cial under oath, and that the war
rant obtained by Rev. Mr. McMillan
did not state probable cause for
a search of the company's ware
house. Mr. Baron also argued on
the improper return made on the
warrant to police court instead of to
Justice Browning's court. Ho con
tended that this was a fatal variance
and destructive to the police depart
ment's case.

Sioux City Journal, May C, 187G:
The match game of baseball yester
day afternoon between the Dakota
City club and the Sioux resulted in
a victory for the former by a score
of 30 to 18. The Dakota City boys
played welt and are a husky looking
set of follows. There were only two
members of the Sioux team in the
game George Hicks and Parke
the rest being picked from the
crowd, and there were only seven
players at that. It is altogether
likely that the Dakota City boys
could have held the Sioux down
about level had the latter been or
ganized and in practice. The result
of the game will no doubt bring
about another contest before long.
Sioux City Journal, May 6, 189G:
The South Sioux City Traction com
pany probably will build a loop at
the south terminus of its street car
line in order that the cars may stop
at the platform of the Omaha depot.
