$1.00 Per Year, In Advance
ONT carry around a groat amount of cur
rency. If you do you are beset by two
great evils. One is tho temptation to spend
readily. A man with $100 in currency" in
his pocket ia freer to spend than tho man
with littlo currency. Ho is more apt to
break a ten dollar bill than he is to draw
a ten dollar check.
The other e?il is tho bait offered to thieves. A man
who is known to carry a largo sum of money in his
possession never can tell when he will bo set upon by a
highwayman. The wealthiest men in tho country sel
dom carry largo amounts of cash. When you accumu
late a goodly amount of currency deposit it in tho bank
at once.
THAT IS THE SAFEST PLACE FOR IT.

CIVIL SERVICE PLAY.
Twice Given in Our City and Well
Received and Largely Attended
at Each Performance.
That a repetition of the "Civil Ser
vice" play was called for proved its
worth and successful rendition at Its
first appearance on Friday evening last
in Central hall.
The audience filled the hall to its
doors to hear this popular drama aud
the ovenlow made a splendid show on
Tuesday evening when it was present
ed the Becond time. The play had come
highly recommended and was under
taken by the ladles of Mrs. lleid's di
vision of the Presbyterian L. li. S. It
was given in charge of Mrs. L. Hoy
Fuller, whose carerui training inrougn
a few weeks of practice showed its
results in the great success achieved.
The ladies and all who took part
certainly appreciate the reception given
each night and feel amply rewarded for
all their work.
As the name "Civil Service" Indicates
the scene is laid in the postoftice of a
small city and the naturalness with
which the postmaster, L. Koy Fuller,
and assistants, George stabierora ana
ltawley Hallman and the little stamp
clerk, Georgia Heavi6, all took their
parts, won much favor.
Old K F D, the veteran mail carrier
was a great character and his sad story
reached every heart and almost every
eye. Dr. v. A. L.acy am nimseixproua
with this.
Helen Harrington acted the part of
the postmaster's daughter splendidly.
She broke the heart of poor ltawley
with practiced ease, but it was later
mended by the little stamp clerk.
The fun of the story centered In the
characters taken by Clifford Hutton
and Mrs. Fuller. Everybody was con
vulsed with laughter at the actions of
this green country couple.
Mrs. Marion Martin taking the part
of a collector, did her duty well, and
the postomce inspector, Koy "iweet, was
admirably fitted for that position.
Another (rood character was that oi
Mrs. T. H. Jeffs, and she was represent
ed so ably by Mtb. Mabel Phillips, that
she merited distinct approbation.
In fact each actor should ana aia
receive merited praise on the excellent
work done throughout, and the goodly
sum of money taken in at the doors
remains in our own little city, and will
be a potent factor in improvement and
the beautifying of church property, a
good cause.
O. E. S. Installation.
A full Drotrram was on Wednesday
evening In Masonic hall when Yale
Chanter O. E. S. held both initiation
and installation ceremonies, ;

band of fellowship in the Order, the

Following this, the newly elected

installed by Mrs. Jennie Pilkey, presi
dent oi tne uoumy Association, wuo
was the guest of honor for the evening.
Alter the ceremony of installation,
Mrs. Howell, Past Worthy Matron, in
behalf of Yale Chapter, presented Mrs.
Pilkey with a sterling silver spoon,
with a star engraved upon it. Mrs.
Pilkev received the gift with a tew ap.

One Postoffice to a County.
If a Democratic measure now before
Congress becomes a law, there will be
only one postoBlce in each county. One
office centrally located will handle mail
with rural routes radiating from it and
snb stations where needed. Under its
terms 60.000 postmasters would be'out
of a job but the offices might remain
as sub-stations with an official in charge
appointed by the postmaster of the
county.
KEEPING UP TO THE MARK.
"Spring fever" Is not always a joke.
It you feel dull and sluggish, tired and
worn out, sutler from backache or weak
back, rheumatism, sore muscles, stiff
joints or other indication of kidney
trouble, it will pay you to investigate
Foley Kidney Pills. They are highly
recommended as prompt and efficient
aids to health. II. T. ilenneesy. ad
