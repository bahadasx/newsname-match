Kl Paso. May 11. General Fun
ston today Is seriously considering
asking the First cavalry of the Chi
cago militia to be brought south for
duty on the Mexican border.
Funston was Informed that the
Chicago regiment has mount and la
ready for duty. The shortage of
cavalrymen on the border led Fun
ston to previously ask the war de
partment for permission to mount
2,000 infantrymen. Funston today
declined to comment upon the report
ed abandonment of the line beyond
Dublan. Officials believe that this
move is progressing under Funston's
orders.
Funston has decided not to go to
Columbus at present, but to go from
El Paso direct to 8an Antonio as soon
as Srott releases him from his con
nection with the Mexican negotia

ridiculing the German statement that
S00.000 French are engaged In tho

caused this to be published to show
the people, that they confronted great
obstacles at Verdun and to explain
their failure to capture the citadel.

Presidential Aspirant Armed in Grants Pass His Morning,
and Made the First Address in His Western Campaign
Before a Great Crowd of People Gathered at Railroad
Park, His Remarks on Conservation of Special Interest
"Unlock the west, and open up its
resources to development," was the
manner in which Senator Albert B.
Cummins, candidate for the republi
can nomination for the presidency of
the United States, prefaced his re
marks upon the conservation policy
in bla address at the Railroad park at
11 o'clock this morning. It was the
keynote of his speech as it affected
bis southern Oregon audience, and
his further expression upon the sub
ject showed that be was not in sym
pathy with a policy that was so ham
pering the development of the west.
Senator Cummins arrived in the
city at 9:30 o'clock from the south,
this being his. first stop upon his
western tour. A large crowd was at
the depot to welcome the distinguish
ed visitor, and bis appearance was
greeted with the firing of the town
cannon and the playing of the Moose
band. As he stepped from the train
he was met by a reception committee,
and bis arms were filled with a bou
quet of glorious Grants Pass roses.
Many former lowans, including sev
ers! who had known the senator in
their home state, were present, and
his reception was an ovation. He was
escorted to the Josephine hotel, where
for an hour an informal reception
was held, and hundreds of ladies and
gentlemen grasped the statesman by
the hand.
Between 2,000 aud 3,000 people
were gathered In Railroad park at
11 o'clock to listen to tho first ad
dress to be -made by Senator Cum
mins upon his campaign In the state
of Oregon, he having come direct to

UNITED STATES SOIL IS REPORT
Marathon, Texas, May 11. The
American authorities are convinced
today that an organized system of
Mexican raids against United States
soil Is being put Into execution.
Fifty Mexicans swooped down up
on the town of Blocker, near Eagle
Pass, looted stores and two ranches
and escaped with a number of horses,
according to advices received here
today. No fatalities were reported.
Civilians along the border organ
ized when they learned that two arm
ed bands had appeared between
Bouqlllas and Ojtnaga. A number
of small border settlements are pre
paring to fight. The authorities be
lieve that the bands are participating
in alternative raids, maintaining a
central headquarters within a short
ride of the line.
Every Mexican on the American
side is under suspicion,' and even
those who have heretofore been
friendly are now distrusted. It is
believed that the raiders obtain in
formation from their countrymen on
the American side and divide tho loot
with thorn.

earlier days, presided at the meeting.
He first Introduced J. U. Sammls, of
Lemars, Iowa, who is accompanying
the senator on bis western tour. Mr.
Sammls eloquently championed the
senator in his ambition to become
president, and paid glowing tribute to
the work which Cummins as legis
lator, governor and member of the
senate of the United Stages had ac
complished for the people of his
country. He told of the Mhmble ori
gin of the man who, horn upon the
farm, had always been close to the
interests of the common people. Mr.
Sammls also , outlined the views ol
Senator Cummins upon such Issues as
preparedness, the tariff, and the
Mexican troubles.
When Senator Cummins was Intro
duced he expressed his pleasure at a
return to a state that had so much
to offer In the way of brilliant sun
shine and invigorating air. But
while the senator paid his compli
ments fully to the people and the
climate and the resources of the west,
he did not waste a great deal of time
In platitudes, but plunged at once
Into the heart of his subject He
said that he had come to Oregon that
they might know his views from him
upon many of the questions of im
portance in the campaign, and which
for him they would solve on the 19th
day of the present month.
The senator, addressing more espe
cially the members of the state
grange, endorsed a system of rural
credits, saying that some way or oth
er the rates of Interest upon farm
loans must he reduced, the land own
er presenting the best security of any
class of Interest payers. He said that

Lieutenant-Colonel Alvarez, one of
the captured Glenn Springs raiders,
was sweated today and promised to
lead the American expedition to the
rescue of Jesse Deemer and Monroe

Alvarez said that his band had
planned to meet another at Ataqullla,
Major Langhorne received other in
formation that the fugitive raiders
were two daya ahead and traveling
slowly. Alvares claimed, when ques
tioned, that he was a Carranzlsta.
Vice-Consul Vasques, who was pre
sent at the Interrogation, denounced
the prisoner, and charged that he was
trying to embarrass the de facto gov
ernment representatives In the El
Paso conference,
"I am sure the raiders were not
Carranzlstas," assorted Vasquez.
"They were Royistas, from Laguna
district. There is no confirmation of
the claim that the Carranza garrison
at Bouqulllas had deserted days be
fore the raid was made."

Washington, May 11. The state

Mexico.
Reports compiled recently said
that there were fewer than 3,000
Americans In Mexico and this num

devotopments caused a massing of
new troops on the border.- Reitera
tion of Mexico's Insistence that a time

Off the CaEfcrtia Ccttt
Port San Luis, CaL, May 11.
While patrols watched the breakers
today for bodies of the 47 believed
dead in the North Pacific liner Roan
oke disaster, a wireless message came
from the steamer Lansing saying that
it had gone over the scene of the :
horror off Point Buchon and found ,
no trace of survivors.
This radio was received at 9:19 ,
a. m. by J. H. Sims, president of the
Pacific Coast railway. It also an
nounced that the Lansing was com
ing In and would arrive at 11 o'clock.
Rumors along the sea coast that
another lifeboat, containing a single
corpse,- had been found, were not
substantiated and were discredited.
So far the only men known to have
escaped death are Joseph F. Erb, a
quartermaster, and two Mexicans,
who drifted ashore with five dead
bodies in a lifeboat near here last
night ' N ;V,

half-way coherent report of the dis
aster so far is Erb. He says that
when his lifeboat pulled away from
the doomed Roanoke after its cargo
had shifted and thrown it on its
beam ends, both the captain and his
wife were clinging to the bridge.
The two Mexicans are suffering so
fro'm shock that they are not able
to talk.
In a later statement Erb said that
two lifeboats were swamped in leav
ing the sinking ship. One' having ar
rived here, this leaves two unaccount

The steam schooner Whittler ar
rived here today and reported hav
ing seen no trace of the Roanoke or
Us lifeboats. A heavy gale is blow
ing, which might make it impossible
tor small boats to keep afloat
Manuel Lopes, fireman, who came
ashore in the lifeboat with Quarter
master Erb and Charles Rovero. told
a graphic story of the disaster this
afternoon when he had partially re
covered from the shock. , '.
He declared that the crew of the
Roanoke was inexperienced and, in
his opinion, the cargo was badly load
ed. He declared he protested to Cap
tain Dickson and begged the skipper
not to take his wife on the voyage.
The steamer's destination, Lopes said.
was not known to him.
' Contrary to statements that the
liner suddenly rolled over when hit
by a big wave, Lopes asserted that It
began to list heavily several hours
before 'it finally sank. When the
steamer began to tip over an attempt
was made to summon help by wire

out of commission. . Signals were
then .hoiBted, but three ships which
passed did not see tiiem.
Finally, according to Lopes, pre
parations were made to take to the
lifeboats. There were, he said,' "about
60 or 60 persons aboard," and if the
lifeboats had been properly handled
Lopes said he believes that all 11 of
them could have been launched. How
ever, several caught In the davits or
were capsized. Five were finally
floated, hut two of these swamped.
In one of the boats still missing
Lopes said there was only one man,
John G. Dennis, the second officer,

to the narrative. He said the boat
