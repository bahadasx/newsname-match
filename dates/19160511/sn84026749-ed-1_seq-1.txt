EL PASO, Tex., May 11. Gen

operative border patrol plan.
The meeting was held in Scott's
private car in the El Paso rail
road yards. Juan Amador, under

ing. Though Eunston declined to
comment on the reported abandon

1 The general has decided not to
visit the Columbus base at this
time, but will go direct to San
Antonio as soon as General Scott
releases him from active connec
tion with the international ne
gotiations here.
Despite the increased tension
along the border there is still a
prospect of peaceful settlement.
NOW AT DANGER POINT.
Friction, however, between military
forces has reached the danger point, and
offlclAli believed peace will be hard to
maintain unless a settlement Is speedily
reached.
General Carranta Is blocking a settle
ment on the plan to which Scott and
Obregon tentative agreed on 'behalf of
their governments In the second con

FRESH RAIDS
Federal Investigators Convinced
There Is an Organized Sys
tem of Assaults.
BANDITS TAKE OFF HORSES
EL PASO, Slay 11. General
Funston is seriously considering
a request to the War Depart
ment to call out the First Cav
alry, Illinois National Guard, of
Chicago, for border patrol duty.
This regiment is equipped
with mounts, and Is ready for
duty.
MARATHON, Tex., May 11.
The bandit raid at Blocker, Tex.,
has convinced Federal investiga
tors along the border today that
an organized system of assaults on
American border settlements is
being carried out. Officials ex
pected further attempts on small
towns within a few days and laid
plans to thwart the raiders.
Fifty bandits swooped down on
Blocker, near Eagle Pass, looted
the store of the Blocker and .Ford
ranches and made off with a num
ber of horses.
There were no fatalities, accord
ing to advices reaching the base.
BANDED FOR PROTECTION.
Civilians along the border banded to
gether for protection when It became
known that there are two armed Mexi
can forces not far from the Dig Bend
border.
Ono force was reported between Bo
qullas and OJinaga, Mexico, and an
other a short distance west of OJInaga.
A number of small settlements within
striking distance of the Mexican camps
were prepared to fight to prevent the
bands from crossing the border in their
neighborhood,
Government agents believe the Mexi
can bands are working with one an
other, participating in alternate raids,
ami maintaining a central headquar
ters at a point in Mexico within a short
ride cf the international boundary line.
F.veiy Mexican on the American side
wos regarded with suspicion. The so
callprt friendly Mexicans whom Ameri
can residents have long regarded as en
tliely trustworthy were regarded with
suspicion as possible agents ot the
raiders.
Government agents believe the raiders
obtain Intimate Information regarding
the settlements from Mexicans living in
the United States and divide their loot
with their Informers.
The troops of the Eighth cavalry un
der Major Langhorne, the vanguard of
the second punitive expedition, camped
on Mexican soil last night, having
crossed the line near Boqulllas. Tex.,
lota yesterday. They accomplished the
hike from Marathon to the border,
ninety-three miles, in schedule time, and
today were expected to push on toward
Aqullla, Mexico, reported to bo the
Mexicans' rendezvous.

to urge the merits of the Hollls-John-son
community forum bill, but was re

issue In th District.
Miss Wilson talked to the pupils about
the wider use ot schools In general.
Principal Davis later said he had no
Instructions in regard to what Miss
"Wilson was to say. but that he thought
It proper. In view ot the attitude ot the
Board of Education on the forum ques
tion, to suggest that she discuss only
the general phases of the forum move
ment. He added that he, personally,
favors the "widest freedom of
speech."
Miss Wilson spoke to an audience of
pupils who gathered, not as purMs, but
as members of the Self-Qovernment
eLacue of the school. She was Intro
duced by Bernard M. Wise, governor
ot the student league, and was escorted

Urges U. S. Pay 75 Cents For
Each Patient, at National
Association Meeting.
A subsidy to States caring for non
resident Indigent tubercular patients was
proposed by Congressman William Kent,
of California, today before the annual
meeting ot the National Association for
the Study and Prevention of Tubercu
losis at the New Wlllard Hotel.
Congressman Kent proposes to pay
each State from tho Federal Treasury
at the rate of 75 cents per day for each
patient cared for. His bill to this effect
Is pending In the House.
"I have seen tho horrors and reollio
the suffering resultant from the uncon
trolled and Irresponsible migration of
tuberculosis Infected people," declared
Mr. Kent. "I am neither a doctor nor
an expert, but during a life spent in the
West 1 have seen neighborhoods which
naturally would be practically exempt
from disease bade especially dangerous
to those not afflicted.
Would Care For All.
"The practical question before us Is
whether we shall be united In asking
Federal authorities to take tnis nrsi ana
necessary step. It Is Intended to lead to
better treatment for those suffering
from the dlsotder, not only non.-resl-dents,
for which the bill specifically pro
vides, but for equally careful troatment
In State Institutions partially subsidlied
and Inspected by tho Federal Govern
ment." Three hundred delegates from every
section of the United States are In at
tendance at the meeting of the associa
tion, sessions being scheduled for today
and tomorrow.
A series of motion picture plays deal
ing with tuberculosis subjects were dis
played thft morning. The plays were
produced by tho Ki'i'son Compony.
Just before 2 o'clock this afternoon

NAPOliEON Hi SCOTT, JOSKPII
Lawyer for Riggs Men
Demands Comptroller
Be Brought to Court
A dramatic moment marked the fourth
day's hearing today of the perjury trial
of the Rlggs National Bank officials,
when Frank J. Hogan, of counsel for
tho defense, demanded the personal ap
pearance of John Skelton Williams,
Comptroller of the Currency, In court.
.Comptroller Williams had been direct
ed by Justlco Slddons, of Criminal Di
vision, No. 1. of the District Supreme
Court, in which tribunal the trial Is In
progress, to produce certain correspond'
ence between himself and Secretary of
the Treasury McAdoo, concerning tho
Rlggs Bank and certain other corre
spondence between the Comptroller's
office and tho bank officials.
Court convened promptly at 10 o'clock,
and as soon as the three defendants,
CharlcB C. Glover, William J. Flathcr,
and Henry H. Flather, entered the
courtroom in company with their coun
sel. District Attorney Laskey arose and
announced that most of the correspond
ence for which the subpoena was is
sued, had been produced.
Some Papers Being Collected.
"There are some of the papers which
are being collected and will be hero
when they are wanted," Mr. Laskey
stated to the court.
The District Attorney then pointed
out that one ot the documents ordered
produced was the report of the exam
ination of the Rlggs Bank, completed
by National Bank Kxamlnor Hann, In
May. 1913.
"I might say here that these reports

of national bank examiners have al
ways been considered strictly confiden
tial papers by the Treasury Depart
ment," declared Mr. laskey.
He then recited several Instances
where courts had Issued subponcaa re
quiring the Comptroller of the .Cur
rency to produce reports of national
bank examiners, and declared that In
each case the reauest was refused and
the -Comptroller's office was sustained
In Its refusal.
He exDlained that even Congress on
one occasion had requested that the
report of a national bank examiner be
submitted to It. and that tho President
of the United States had called on
the Attorney General for an opinion
with respect to the request. The At
torney General. Mr. Laskey said, had
upheld the action of tho Treasury De
partment In refusing Congress the re
port. "But. notwithstanding the precedents
the report of Examiner Hann. ordered
In the subpoena Is produced here," de
clared Mr. Laskev.
Demands Williams Appear.
"What Is the Issue before the court,
pleaso?" Interpolated Attorney Hogan
lor the defense, at this Juncture.
"I beg to call to the court's nttcntlon."
he said, "that this subpoena was Issued
on Comptroller Williams to produce
these documents, and not Mr. l.askcy.
Why Is Mr. Williams not here?"
Mr. Laskey then turned to the de
fendant's counsel and stated:
"Mr. Williams la in tne courthouse,
and can be produced In this room at
any moment. 1 think that I. ns attorney
for the Government, am privileged to
represent him."
Many In the courtroom, following this
announcement of the District attorney,
anticipated tho calling of Mr, Williams
to the witness stand, and the airing of
a part at least of tho now famous feud
between him and the threo defendants
on trial.
Counsel for the dfen said nt re.
cess, however, that they had no atten-

Though Oermon artillery continues
