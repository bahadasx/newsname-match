of honor at these services
Nothing is too good, and none
are more deserving of all the
honors it is within the power of
the younger generaflon to be'
stow, than the bovs of '61. It is
only a matter of a few years, uA
til they all will have crossed the
Great Divide, so while we have
them with us let's not be lacking
in doing out share toward pay
ing the debt of gratitude this
nation owes tbem, and especially
upon the one day set apart, the
day upon which we strew with
flowers the graves of those de
parted, and do honor to those
who are yet with us.

That Printer of Udell's
Mr. Harold Bell Wright's first
introduction into the world of
literature was through his fam
ous story, "That Printer of
Udell's. Since then he has been
the author of several world re-
nouned creations which have
made his name a synonym of lit
erary excellence throughout the
English speaking world.
"That Printer of Udell's" is
full of local color, containing a
beautiful and continuous' love
story coupled with dramatic in
cidents which hold audiences
spellbound from start to finish
One reason why this play is so
popular is because every com'
munity bas the originals of
"That Printer of Udell's." This
drama contrasts the hypocrisy
of some prominent so-called
Christians with the less vauoted
but more sincere Christianity of
many common people who be'
heve in good deeds instead of lip
service. It will be presented
here under the able direction of
Mr. Sanford Dodge supported by
an excellent cast and enhanced
by a complete scenic equipment
