COOKEVILLE CITY SCHOOL
BY M. T. Carlisle, Supt.
. Cookeville, tho only a little moun

cessful operation. This school at
this time embraces only the 8 grades
of the elementary course and has an
enrollment of 550 students, with a
teaching force of ten teachers. The
school is at present a bit handicap
ped for want of room, yet many pro
gressive features at once catch the
eye . and interest of every visitor.
This school is distinctly the school
of the people. Its influence touches
every home in the city. It has,
therefore, been the one aim of the
administration to make it a model
of efficiency. Those in charge of its
affairs are unwilling that any town
In Tennessee shall surpass Cooke
ville in providing effective' means for
the early education of her boys and
girls. Progres Is the keynote of
the present administration. During
the past two or three years the fol
lowing features have been introduc
ed; Manual training, domestic art,
military drill, physical culture, half
day session for primary grades, the
school lunch, the story hour, and seg
regation of sexes. Compulsory vac
cination -and volunteer medical in
spection , have been practiced for
several years.
The Future r
In every progressive and rapidly
developing town, in which class
Cookeville justly falls, the school
system is a growing instituticti a
growth both in size and scope of
work undertaken. Such growth
comes slowly as the need becomes
imperative.
Within the past two years there
has been 20 per cent, increase in at
tendance at Cookeville City School.
This means that an early, date a larg
er plant will be a necessity. This
is the -biggest problem that confronts
the city at present. Other problems
that are receiving present attention
are the establishment of vocational
courses, which better fit the individ
ual for -the life he is to lead. Closer
supervision and enlargement of
teaching force. No town In Tennes
see is more alive to its educational
responsibility than Cookeville and
she will not be found wanting when
confronted by her large educatioal
problems of the future.

MOTHER'8 TREASURE
Lovingly dedicated to Rev. R. J.
Craig on hearing his sermon to par-
ents
The Father in Heaven above,
With gentleness, tenderly smiled,
And sent me a token of love
A pure and a beautiful child.
The bud with such promise of life
Will blossom jp brighten the earth.
No fruitage of Eden, thougn fair.
Could ever compare with Its worth.
Ao nure as the drops of the dew,
As bright as the glittering gold; ;
No lovlier gift has been given
Than this little babe I behold.
O, what did God say in his message,
When sending this token so fain
"This child I commit to your keeping,
Commend to your tenderest care.
"A treasure, a spirit Immortal, :.,'
With promise of greatness untold.
Be' faithful and shield it from danger,
The bud, blest with light will on
fold." . T
Dear Father in Heaven, I pray,
To me, needed wisdom Impart,
To write only lessons of truth, .
In love on his Innocent heart, ,
Btand as a sentinel brave,
So close to the beautiful gate. '
That evil may never intrude
To damage his blessed estate.
I trust that my child will not know
The curse of a parent .unwise;
That angels will ever attend.
And bear him at last to the skies.
