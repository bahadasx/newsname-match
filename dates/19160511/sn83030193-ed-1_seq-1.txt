PEACE MOVE MADE BY POPE
IS FIRM BELIEF IN ROME
By John II. Hearlcy.
ROME, May II tUnited Press). Tliouuli no informa
tion is obtainable from the Vatican, it is generally reported
in Rome that Pope Benedict, through Agr. Honzano,
Apostolic Delegate to Washington, has requested President
Wilson to initiate a movement for peace.
It is rumored that Frunce alone, of all the belligerents,
is not now inclined to make peace.
The above cablegram from the Koine burt'itu of the lulled 1'ret.s
was transmitted through Havre, and therefore passed through the hands
of both the Italian nnd French ceiihors. The very fact that 'Loth censors
permitted the cabling of tho statement that it wns rumored In Home
that all the belligerents except France are now Inclined toward peace
may he of the highest significance ax Indicating the attitude of the
allies toward the pence hint contained In the German reply to I'reslednt
Wilson's submarine note.
