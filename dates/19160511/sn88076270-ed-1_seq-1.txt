WILLISTON'S DIAMOND DUSTERS
WILL BE KNOWN BY NEW
NAME—LIVELY ELECTION
In one of the many applications
from players received by the Willis
ton Base Ball board, the writer, in
giving several pages of information
about himself, confided: "They call
me Casey in base ball." Well—in base
ball they will call us the Opportunes.
At any rate they, which stands for all
fandom, should get the habit of doing
so for such is the duly elected nick
name, chosen by a popular election
lasting eight days.
Five names were voted on. These
had been selected from all those sug
gested in the name contest, by three
judges.
The five names and the vote cast
for each are:
The Opportunes 152
The Coyotes 182
The Ranchers 118
The Electrics 17
The Invincible* IS
There was much interest in the elec
tion among the lovers of the national
pastime. Friends of the Coyotes got
out and electioneered for their choice
with good results.
Offered by Ad Man
The winning name was offered by
Chas. Schramm, advertising solicitor
for the Williston Graphic, and he is
being congratulated on suggesting
an advertising term that had a
psychological kick in it that "got to"
a plurality of the base ball electrate.
The Opportunes won on it's merits.
No one solicited votes for the name
but a large number evidently argued
that ball players representing the
City of Opportunity might well be
called the Opportunes. In Minneapo
lis their team is called the Millers, in
Washington,'the Senators, so why not
the Opportunes in this city
of UK-
rivaled opportunities? A good base
ball team is for both amusement and-f
advertising—advertising was the ob
ject the board had in view In having
a name thus chosen.
Some people were looking for a
name that would make an instan
taneous hit with everybody but there
is no saeh thing—a name has to grow
up and into popularity, like a pretty
girl. The popularity of the name will
depend largely on the work of the
team.
The Squad At Work
Manager Clarence Marshall has his
recruits out every day and there is
a big bunch of them. About a dozen
local men are trying out and several
have come from distant points of
their own accord to try for the team.
C. A. Ruyle and Chas. Immings of
last years team arrived from St. Louis
Sunday. Alex Harper, the fast short
stop who was seen here last year, and
an all round man named Kolls are on
their way.
Games Soon
An exhibition game between two
teams chosen from the squad will prob
ably be played soon and if possible
a game with an outside team will be
arranged for the 17th a feature of the
celebration held by The Sons of Nor
way.
The grounds and seats will be put
in better condition and some real
bases and a rubber home plate put in
place. Altogether the prospects are
bright for a successful season of ball.
The "Convict Ship" At
Orpheum, May 16-17
Putting aside all the press agent
hot air stuff about the Convict Ship
feature, which comes to the Orpheum
theatre, Tuesday and Wednesday,
May 16 and 17, it is safe to say that
this feature is of the highest value in
a certain educational way. Viewed
in its historical aspect the old "Suc
cess" is intensely interesting. Most
of the people who visited the San
Francisco exposition went through
the ship which was moored in tvi°bQ'1'
during the exposition period and it
tells a story of by-gone days that
cannot now be presented in any other
way,
TJ
It gives^us a graphic picture of
the way in which English prisoners,
sentenced to the penal colonies, were
handled. That era has been closed
for nearly a century, but this old ship,
built in 1790, reveals it all. It is a
page torn directly from history—a
page that should be read by every
one, and we can promise that all who
read the page will find it intensely in
teresting.

Did You Clean

Or did all that litter and weeds
and paper that the wind brought
to my yard after I had cleaned,
oh, so carefully, come from your
yard? Don't you see how we've
all got to clean up, for if you
don't care, your neighbor does
and the wind is no respector of
persons? It smites the clean
and the unclean alike. The time
is coming right here in our own
city when the dirty places will be
the exceptional places. Is some
one going to say of your home
or business place, "Yes, I know
where that is, its so dirty," or
rather, "Its that beauty spot up
street." I like to trade there,
everything is spotless." Its your
home, your place of business, no
body else can clean up for you.
Whether rich or poor, its cheap

Many Ride But Few
Have 1916 Licenses
County Attorney Owens says com
plaints are coming in to his office
about the failure of auto owners to
secure 1916 licenses. As a result the
county road fund loses the money.
Mr. Owens thinks car owners should
do their part toward good roads. He
says that less than 50 per cent of the
cars are provided with this year's
tags. He wishes to give fair warning
and then if the law is not complied
with he will be obliged to do his duty
in enforcing it.

STATE own
BELIEVES IN INDEPENDENT
PLANTS THROUGH CO-OPERA
TION, NOT POLITICS
U. L. Burdick, of Williston, in a
statement on the question of public
utilities, defines, the position he takes
with respect to such issues made
prominent in the present gubernatori
al campaign:
The Nonpartisan league has de
clared in its platform that it is in
favor of state terminal elevators,
packing plants, flour mills, etc. From
this rather ambiguous statement it is
difficult to determine just what posi
tion the league has taken in reference
to the public utilities question.
Generally speaking, I am opposed
to state of North Dakota going into
speculative business enterprises.
Should the state build packing plants
and flour mills with funds raised from
the tax payers, what assurance would
the tax payers have that (through a
political machine) in the building and
operating of such enterprises there
would be efficiency, business judg
ment and economy exercised? Would
the more natural presumption be that
politics, rather than competency
would control not only in the building,
but in the operation of such enter
prises? Furthermore, should one ad
ministration honestly and faithfully
administer the affairs of such con
cerns what assurance would there be
that the next change in administra
tion would continue the work in the
same manner as the former adminis
tration. It is more natural to assume
that a change in administration with
the bitterness of campaigns, criticism,
honest and dishonest, would be re
flected in every department even to
the packing plants and flour mills.
Do the people of North Dakota want
to spend their money to build up more
political machines?
I am a Arm believer in packing
plants in North Dakota, in flour mills,
etc., but Just as firmly believe that
these should be built and operated on
the co-operation plan.
History shows how by co-operation
these enterprises have been successful
—Denmark is the clearest example of
the eo-operation plan. So are the Fruit
Growers' associations of the western
states. So is the Co-operative ex
change in St. Paul. Laws should be
passed to encourage such co-opera
tion enterprises—for instance not lim
it the capital Stock, but the state
should not own and operate them in
its soverign capacity, with the prob
ability of a change in management
with every chance in party or fac
tions.
Work Starts Soon On
New Pontoon Bridge
Monday evening an informal meet
ing of the officers and some of the
stockholders of the Missouri Ridge
River Bridge Company met at the
office of President Calderwood to con
fer with Captain Charlesworth, in
charge of the U. S. boat, Mandan
which had stopped here.
The plans showing the manner of
construction were brought in by H.
R. Evans and carefully considered.
The company will have carpenters at
work at an early date.
U. S.
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM IN A
TIONS
An open competitive examination
under the rules of the U. S. Civil
Service Commission for the position
of Clerk (male or female) and Car
rie* in the postoffice, Williston, N.
Dak., will be held on Saturday, May
27, 1916, commencing at 9 o'clock A.
M. Blank applications and the neces
sary instructions may be obtained
from Chas. Newell, local secretary
Civil Service Board at the postoffice.
The captain is a riverman of long ,. ,,
district and the farmers interests well
experience and his advise was asked
on numerous important features of
the work about to be undertaken.
Concerning the site -of the Williston
bridge he said he considered it the
'best any place along the river as the
landings were protected and the chan
nel narrow. He strongly advised an
overhead cable as the only practical
means of holding the bridge in place.
As to the best manner of making a
crossing in the. old channel, south of
the island he said that piling would
probably be better than pontoons as
the tressel work would cause the shal
low channel to fill with drift and silt
deposit and become solid and per
manent, whereas the varing stages
of water would make trouble with
pontoons.

old resident and one of the successful
farmers of the western part of the
county. He is a man who keeps

publican with pronounced progressive

BURDICK IN THE WEST

ing this week in the western end of
the state, working about the Dickin
son district particularly. The latter
part of this week he will #o into the
country north of Bickison.

is being thrown to him from day to
day.
American Birds—
Interesting Series
Beginning with this week The Gra
phic will publish a long series of illus-
tr?.ted articles on Common American
Birds, many of which, observation
will discover, frequent our section in
spring and summer.
These articles cannot fail to in
terest the boys and girls, the lovers
of Nature old or voune, the farmers
and their families, or those who own
gardens or orchards in the towns or
country. This feature offers a liberal
education on a popular subject, and in
an attractive form. The fact that it
is prepared by the Biological Survey
of the United States Department of
Agriculture is a guarantee of the re
liability of the information in this
series of articles.

Burdick The Favorite
Warwick Sentinel—Usher L.
Burdick is showing up all over
the state as the favorite candi
date for governor. His platform
embraces several issues that the
stste's progressive voters want
and in all his political actions he
has shown himself independent of
bosses. Inconsistency to the
principles, to further which many
joined the Nonpartisan league, is
all that keeps the members from
supporting him in spite of the
fact that their leader did not in
dorse him. Steele county will
surely give him a good vote.

Berlin, May 5.—The German gov

respecting .submarine warfare, close
to 2,500 words in length, handed to
Ambassador Gerard by Gottlieb von
Jagow, foreign secretary, plays Great
Britain against the United States in*
a long review and argument, concern-

up Great Britain's attempt to starve
many millions of German women and

these defenseless women and childrev
as it does about the rights of neutral*
on high seas asserts that Great
Brithain flatly refused to obey the
re gulati ons of international law roo
fers to the supplying of allies with'
munitions from America, and assert*,,
therefore, that the appeal of the Uni
ted States to sentiments of humanity
and principles of international law
cannot meet the same hearty response
from the German people which such'
an appeal otherwise always -is certain
to find here. It than concludes ia
part, as follows:
"The German government notifies
the United States that German navaf
forces have received the following or
der:
"'In accordance with the general
principles of visit and search and the
destruction of merchant vessels, rec
ognized by international law, such
vessels both within and without the
area declared a naval war zone, shall
not be sunk without warning and''
without saving human lives, unless

"The German government handed
over to the proper naval authorities
for early investigation the evidence
concerning the Sussex as communi

the investigation has hitherto yield

to the possibility that the ship men

marine is actually identical with the
Sussex.
"The German government begs to
reserve further communication on the
matter until certain points are ascer
tained, which are of decisive impor

case. Should it turn out that the
commandant was wrong in assuming
the vessel to be a man-of-war, the
German government will not fail to
draw consequence resulting there
