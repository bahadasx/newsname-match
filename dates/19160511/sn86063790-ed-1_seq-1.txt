Laying Submarine Mines.
,;k , __
> \
The mines which have been chiefly^used
in the present war are auto^
/ matic and mechanical, and are fired
when the ship strikes against them.
Mines of this type are easily laid.
When stowed away on the deck of a
mine-laying ship the mine rests on
the anchor which at the same time
forms a little carriage which can be
rpn over the stern of the ship.
Whether mines have actually been
laid 'by submarines is, of course,
knowi\ only to the naval authorities.
Patents have, however, been taken
out within the last few years for
specially designed mines to be laid
by submarines and also for providing
submarine boats with a series of
chambers on each side for holding
i
and launching mines. These chambers
are disposed between double
walls of the submarine and are made
jfc' .
to form a smooth outline with the
hull of the boat.
; v>- .
A mine is maintained at the desired
depth in the water by means of
an anchor in which the cable, one
end of which is connected to the
*
mine, is unwound from a drum suitably
braked and mounted in the an*v"'
chor casing. The rotation of the
. drum is controlled by a bump weight
^ attached to a short sounding line.
When the plumb weight reaches the
bottom of the sea the rotation of the
.4 drum is stopped and the mine is pulled
down to the required depth. It is
only necessary to determine at what
depth below the surface it is desired
to anchor the mine and to throw in-r*7ofnr

the "whole apparatus will take
up its proper position, the depth of
submersion being determined by the
length of the sounding line.?Popu^

STATE CONVENTION NEXT WEEK.
To i;is? uss "Circus," Woman Suffrage
and Other Topics.
Columbia, May 8.?Ninety-eight
delegates to the State * convention,
May 17, will come either directly instructed
or inferentially pledged to
oppose any measure tending to abolish
the county-to-county canvass of
the candidates for State offices, according
to a study of the reports of |
the various county conventions held
throughout the State May 1. Thej
agitation against the "biennial cir-j
cus" has been especially noticeable in |
the last two years and one delega- j
tion from Greenwood, consisting of i
eight men, were instructed by their j
convention to institute and fight for
a resolution doing away with the'
rr^rtct imnnrtant matter to come be-!
ua VUV AMAf' V* ? ^
campaign. This will probably oe the
fore the State Democratic conven-i
1
tion this year. |
Petitions in favor of woman suffrage
will likely be presented.
There will be 338 delegates to the!
convention, two more than formerly
on account of the new county of McCormick,
which will have a representation
of four, while Abbeville!
county, formerly having eight, will I
have only six delegates. The number
of delegates from all other counties
remains the same, being twice j
the county's representation in the
general assembly.
? Beaufort county will probably
send a contested delegation, as one
faction bolted during the recent convention.
Beaufort will also attempt
to have the convention adopt a rule
placing municipal primaries under
the supervision of the State machinery.
A recent election in Beaufort is
the direct cause of the movement for
protection. Minor changes in the
rules will also be considered by the
body, as suggested at the recent
meeting of fhe State executive committee.
Newspaper accounts also show the
following: The administration of
Gov. Manning was commended in
whole or in part by Sumter, Bamberg,
Beaufort and Kershaw counties,
the delegation in the last tteing
all Manning men. Anti-Blease forces
__ 1
won the contention in Barnwell.
Supporters of Blease carried the
conventions in Anderson and Newberry.
\ McCormick county showed
an anti-Manning sentiment. In the
Chester convention a resolution commending
the State administration
was not voted on because of a motion
to adjourn. A woman suffrage
resolution in the Richland county
convention met the same fate.
Hearty and ringing indorsements
of the administration of President
Woodrow Wilson and recommending^
his renomination by the Democratic
party were adopted in 42 counties;
no mention of such action by the
county convention was made in the
reports from Charleston and Dillon.
A further analysis of the attitude
toward the county-to-county canvass
shows: That there will be 98 delegates
favoring its continuance, 30
opposed, 30 uninstructed, 12 seeding
an improvement, 14 wishing to submit
the question in a primary to the
voters of the State. From 19 coun
ties, in which the question was not
brought up for discussion, there will
be 150 delegates; with these, however,
the probability is that they will
vote to retain the canvass, as they
have received no instructions from
"the people."
Estate of $100,000,000.
It has just been determined that
Lamon Vernon Harkness, third vice
president of the Standard Oil company,
and second largest stockholder
in the concern, who died in California
on January 17, 1915, left an estate
estimated at more than $100,000,000.
The bulk of his property
will go to his son, Harry S. Harkness,
and his daughters, Mrs. Lila H. Edwards,
of Pittsburg, and Mrs. Myrtle
K. Macomber, of Paicines Rancho,
near Hollister, Cal.
Harry S. Harkness is the leading
amateur automobile racer of America
and is famed for his daring driving.
He takes chances with his life and
limb with the best of the professional
racers.

Newspapers to Raise Prices.
rp" J - 1- 11 nAn-c
I lie irdue juuintus aic iun vi ucno
about the wonderful advance in the
price of all material that is used in
making newspapers. News ink,
white newspaper, linotype metal all
have advanced beyond conception,
the latter being double what it could
be bought for some months ago. As
a result of this advance publishers
are pretty hard hit. In some . instances
fear is expressed as to the
ability of the large dailies to secure
paper, even at the advanced price, in
sufficient quantities to enable them
to continue getting out the mammoth
'editions that they have been accustomed
to publish.
In order to meet this advance in
the price of all material, we note
that the statement has been made
that the great dailies, instead of selling
their papers for five cents per
copy, it may be necessary for them to
raise the price to fifteen cents. There
is no question about it that while
subscription rates may remain the
same, papers will be forced to raise
the price of advertising and job
work. Newspapers are no longer run
on the principle of "go if you can"
and "go just any way," but they are
run as other business enterprises
are run and so they will be compelled
to raise their prices just as the merchant
does on goods that cost him
more than they formerly did. This
is business pure and simple, and no
business can sustain itself that does
not meet conditions that confront it
in a business-like way. It is either
this or go to the wall.?Greenwood

VERDUN A DESOLATE PICTURE.
Correspondent Describes Visit to the
World's Greatest Battlefield.
Gaston Deschamps, writing in the
Paris Temps, gives a vivid description
of his visit to the Verdun front,
from which he has just returned.
The account follows:
"The vast battlefield was veiled by
a sleety rain, but Verdun, Douaumont
and Le Mort Homme were
vaguely outlined in the distance.
Verdun, wounded but still upright,
stood like a sentinel guarding the
entrance of the valley above the
blackened ruins of houses, while the
towers of the cathedral rose like two
outstretched arms in protest against
the misery and desolation about
them. The citadel still stands un
scathed.
"Villages are now abandoned and
become military positions where the
further presence of civilians is impossible.
The whole aspect of the
vast panorama is one of intense melancholy.
At intervals incendiary
bombs burst among the ruins, throwing
great clouds of black smoke and
debris. From time to time fires
were started by bombs, and here and
there village houses were seen blazing
through the mists, but amid all
this scene of fire and explosion no
human beings could be seen anywhere;
as it was, hidden monsters of
steel, far away, were working their
terrible destruction. The absence of
human activity added to the supreme
sadness.
"One could see the ancient ruins of
the old Roman camps in this vicinity,
where the Romans resisted the German
invaders, even Rue Mazel, the
main thoroughfare of Verdun, being
an ancient Roman road."
NEW ANNEXATION PROJECT.
Plan to Put Hardeeville Section in
Jasper County.
Ridgeland, May 7.?A mass meet
ing of the citizens of Hardeeville and |
vicinity was held Wednesday for the
purpose of perfecting an organization
with the view of annexing that section
of Beaufort county to Jasper
county. At present it is necessary
for the citizens living in that section
of Beaufort county to pass through
Ridgeland, the county seat of Jasper,
to get to Beaufort, about 60 miles
from Hardeeville, while Ridgeland is
only 20 miles. The section which it
is proposed to annex contains about
one hundred voters.
Hal G. Heyward was eletced chairman
of the meeting. R. H. Welch,
an attorney from Columbia, was present
and outlined the procedure necessary.
'A large number of Jasper's
citizens were present to show their
interest in this movement, and to
lend any cooperation possible. It is
expected that an election will be ashed
lor the near future.
GERMAN NOTE EXPLAINED.
The Tone Intended for Berlin, the
Substance f?r Washington.
We are disposed to pass over without
much attention those features of!
the German note wnich are more or
less apart from its main and substantial
declaration; such, for exi
ample, as the half-hearted admission
of the validity of our evidence about
the sinking of the Sussex, and the attempt
to offset the inhumanity of the
illegal and murderous assault on neutrals
at sea with a denunciation of
the admittedly legal traffic by neutrals
in munitions. Many of the expressions
of the note are calculated
to exasperate, and.seem to be unnecessary
as well as unfortunate, in
view of the main fact of compliance.
But it is no more than fair to keep in
mind the circumstances that in order
to be effective this deliberate
move of the imperial government for
the preservation of friendly relations
must take account of divided opinion
in Germany. The note had to be
written not only as a reply to a
specific demand of the American
government, but also with a view to
the satisfaction of natural pride and
a very exacting national sentiment
at home in the empire.
The tone is manifestly intended for
Berlin, the substance for Washington.
The administration may well
concentrate its attention upon the essential
fact, and that fact is that an
immeasurable and apparently imminent
calamity has by Germany's act
been averted without the obliteration
of a single bright band in the
spectrum of this republic's honor.?

ANOTHER MEXICAN RAID.
FOUR KILLED WHEN OUTLAWS
MAKE ATTACK.
It Has Not Been Determined Whether
Outlaws Were Villa or Carranza
Followers.
El Paso, Texas, May 7.?-Three
American soldiers and a 10-year-old
# v
boy have lost their lives and two
American citizens have been kidnapped
and carried south of the international
boundary to almost certain
death in another raid of Mexican ban
dits that takes rank with Francisco
Villa's famous attack on Columbus,
New Mexico. Whether the marauders
were Villa bandits or Carranza
forces is not known.
The bandits' foray, carrying them
through the southern limits of Brewster
county,' in the Big Bend district
of Texas, and taking in three little
settlements near the border?Glenn
Springs, Boquillas and Deemers?
took place on Friday night and Saturday
morning, but news of it did
not reach her? until today.
Report to Funston.
Practically all the details of the
raid reaching here today came to
Gen. Funston from Major O. B.
Meyers, of the 14th cavalry, stationed
at Marfa. According to Major .Meyers
the bandits, about seventy-five in
number, crossed the Rio Grande late
Friday afternoon at a point south of
Terlingua, Tex, where there is a
guard of about thirty men.
From there they proceeded eastward
through the desolate reaches of
the Big Bond country over an old
-wagon road toward Glenn Springs, a
small ranch settlement.
A few miles west of Glenn Springs
A i ? A 1 ~ M
an American pairui ui eigne men
from Troop A, of the 14th cavalry,
under command of Sergt. Smith, was
stationed. The bandits began an attack
on the little temporary shack
in which the eight troopers were
quartered before the single sentinal
could raise an alarm. The time was
about 11 o'clock.
The attackers rushed toward the
shack shouting "Viva Villa!" and
"Viva Carranza!" They were met by
a sturdy defence from the half asleep
Americans, however, and failed in
their evident attempt to make a
q,uick capture of the patrol guard.
Three Killed.
From 11 o'clock that night until
after 2 o'clock in the morning Sergt.
Smith fought the Mexicans from the
shelter of the patrol house. In that
time three of his men, Privates
Cohen, Coloe and Rogers, had been
killed and he and all the rest were
wounded. Then the shack caught
fire.
It was impossible to stay longer so
Sergt. Smith ordered a retreat. Two
of his men were so badly wounded it

Smith and the other men succeeded
in removing the badly wounded
and took out th^ bodies of the three
dead men and carried them to a place
of safety. X
There was a motor truck attached
to the camp. The dead and dangerously
wounded men were loaded into
this and sent toward Marathon, a station
on the Southern Pacific, 85 miles
north.
One man accompanied the truck.
This left Smith and two others to engage
the bandits. They retreated to
the low hills and fought from behind
rocks and mounds of gravel.
Mexicans Retreat.
While this was going on, ranchmen
of the vicinity heard the shooting
and hurried to the scene. Ali.1.

an adequate reinforcement and about
4 o'clock, as dawn neared, the Mexicans
retreated.
This was five hours after the fight- .
ing began. The bandits rode toward
the east until they came to Glenn
Springs. There they looted a general
store and killed the 10-year-old son
of C. G. Compton. Then they ,
proceeded to Boquillas, a few miles ?
north of the Rio Grande, where they <
seized supplies and forage and rode 1
on again.
Their next stop was at Deemers.
Here, according to the reports receiv- ]
ed in El Passo, they looted the gen- ]
eral store of John Deemers. Then <
they crossed back into Mexico, tak- 1

POPE TO WILSON ON PEACE.
II
Message Causes Peep Interest Among
Officials.
? -$j
Washington, May 6.?Fear that a
break between the United States and
Germany would impair the ability of
the United States to aid in restoring
peace in Europe is said to have in-,
fluenced Pope Benedict in communicating
with the president. The message,
taken in connection with the
suggestion in Germany's last note
that she was ready to, consider peace
on certain terms, caused deep interest
among officials here. The Pope, v ;
like President Wilson, is understood
to be ready to make peace suggestions
when he believes the time is
ripe. \ ' 'j
Up to the present, so far as could
be learned tonight, there has been no
intimation from the allied govern- 1
ments that peace overtures would be
welcomed. President Wilson consistently
has taken the position that he
could noi with propriety make further
mediation offers unless all parties
to the war were ready to discuss
the subject.
Border Pact is Ratified.
Washington, May 4.?The agreement
reached by General 'Scott, of
the United States, and General Obre- ... >3j
gon, of Mexico, for the joint pursuit
of Villa by American and Mexican
troops, has been ratified by President
Wilson. The white house has
not permitted any announcement to
this effect to be made, but it was/
learned that just as soon as word is
received that Carranza approves, the
pact this government will announce
officially that it has also done so.
It was learned on official authority
that the agreement does not set any
time limit for the withdrawal of the
American trooDs. The wording of.
the pact is such that the American forces
can remain in Mexico indefi- -,i||
nitely unless Villa is either captured
or killed or his forces effectively dis- . - y||1
persed.
GAINING STRENGTH DAILY.
.
"Give Maiming a Second Term" the
Sentiment on All Sides*
"We have not fully*agreed with
Governor Manning in all official acts, \ ;|i
but he has made one of the best governors
we have had in a long time, *
and we see no reason why he should
not be given a second term, as it has
been the unbroken custom in this
i
State since the primary was inaugurated.?Pee
Dee Advocate.
The above is, to say the very leasl
y>:fa|
of it, ominous. We have not always
agreed with Governor Manning
either, but so far from causing us to
think less of him it only makes us"
have a higher regard for him. Had
he done only the things we thought
he should have done in every instance
he, no doubt, would have
made more mistakes than he has
made. There can be no question
about it, Manning has made a conscientious,
faithful official, and we
do not hesitate to say we see no. reason
why he should not have the endorsement
that he deserves. '
A gentleman remarked to us the
other day that there was no doubt
about it, Governor Manning was
gaining strength everyday. He then
went on to tell what prominent
Greenwood men had to say about
him?men some of whom had been
only a few weeks since rather timid
and shy of the governor's prospects.
We are not fighting Governor
Manning's battles, nor are we committing
this newspaper to hie support,
or for that matter to the support
of any other man, but we are
speaking as a free born citizen, who
has a right to his individual opinions.?Greenwood

mander of the Southern army division,
and Gen. Scott, chief of staff
of the United States army, have been
staying during the conference with
Gen. Obregon, Mexican minister of
war.
Identity of Raiders.
The point most speculated upon,
here tonight was the identity of the
raiders. Carranza military officials ?
only a day or so ago declared that 1
this section had practically been
cleared of bandits.
Fifteen days ago the members of
the Carranza garrison at Boquillas,
the Mexican town just across tne uio
Grande from Boquillas, Texas, sud^
ienly disappeared. They have not
?een heard from since and there has
3een a suspicion that they might, ~
lave deserted to the Villa forces.
Military men thought tonight they
probably participated in the raid. ~ |
