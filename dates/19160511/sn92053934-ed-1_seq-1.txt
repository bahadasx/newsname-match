BALFOUR ROUSES
ENGLISH PRESS
London Times' Naval Correspondent
Resents Defense Plan Announced
by First Lord of Admiralty.
London, May 11. The naval corres
pondent of the Times, in an article in
today's issue, criticizes the recent an
nouncement of First Lord of the Ad
miralty, Arthur J. Balfour, that the
British fleet was to be redistributed to
prevent coast raids by the Germans.
"Mr. Balfour's statement," the cor
respondent Bays, "is disquieting to
students of naval warfare because the
First Lord appears to foreshadow a re
versal of that policy of offensive de
fense which we have successfully fol
lowed since the 14th century.
"The object of the Germans in mak
ing these raids is to bring about a re
distribution of our naval forces to
their own advantage. After the at
tack on Hartlepool, the admiralty
stated that such raids must not be al
lowed to modify the general navy pol
icy. This was sound sense. But now
Mr. Balfour suddenly announces that
alterations are being made in the dis
tribution of our naval forces.
"The alterations are as follows:
First, important naval forces are be
ing brought southward; second, sub
marines and monitors are to be used
for coast defense.
"The weakness of this strategical
change lies in the substitution of
squadrons in fixed positions on our
own coast for periodical sweeps which
have been told the battle fleet is in the
habit of making through the length
and breadth of tbe North sea.
"As for submarines, these have
never proved their ability to torpedo
boats going at full speed and raiders
are likely to have little difficulty in
avoiding their attention."
SUDDEN AGREEMENT

Chicago, May 11. An agreement be
tween counsel for the Chattanooga
Medicine company and the American

CAVALRY IS READY
FOR FUNSTON CALL
Kl Paso, May 11. General Fun.
ston is considering- calling on the
First Illinois cavalry, national
guard, for patrol duty on the bor
der. Chicago. May 11. Lieutenant Col
onel W. H. Whigam, commanding the
First regiment Illinois cavalry during
the absence of Colonel Milton J. Fore
man in Washington, when informed to
day that General Funston is planning
to call upon his troops for border pa
trol duty, said that the regiment could
assemble and entrain, fully equipped,
within 24 hours after the order had
been given.
The men, he said, have been expect
ing the call to arms for some time and
are fully prepared. The First Illinois
consists of 12 troops of 65 men each,
nine troops of which are in Chicago,
one in Springfield, another in Peoria
and the other at Urbana.
The medical corps and commissary
department are also here and prepared
he said. Each troop could be recruited
to 100 men immediately, if it be re
quired, he said.
Wbile the First cavalry has not suf
ficient horses, Lieutenant Colonel
Whigam said that additional mounts
could be purchased Immediately, but
that he did not believe that this would
be necessary, stating that the govern
ment would probably secure horRes
from along the border which would
be bolter fitted to cope with border
conditions.

Irish Affairs
Hold British
Public Mind
London, May 11. Premier As
quitli announced in the house of
commons this afternoon that he
felt it to be his duty to go to Dub
lin today.
London, May 11. Irish affairs oc
cupied today even a more important
position in the public iuind than they
did at the time of the itbme rule con
troversy. Both bouses ot parliament
are again engaged with them today.
John Dillon's motion for discussion
of the executions in Ireland comes
up in the house of commons and the
house of lords is considering Lord
Loreburn's motion expressing dissatis
faction with the Irish administration.
The debate in the house of commons
is regarded as the more important,
for there the government comes un
der the cross-fire of the whole Irish
party and of a large number of lib
eral members who are determined to
bring to an end not only arrests and
executions in Ireland but martial law.
The execution in County Cork of
Thomas Kent, although it took place
before Premiar Asquith gave his as
surance that no further death sen
tences would be carried out until the
debate was concluded, has brought
forth further protests. The national
ists also are concerned at the contin
ued arrest and deportation to England
for confinement in English jails of
rebels from all parts ot the country.
The number of arrests has not been
made known, but it must be several
thousand.
Fourteen persons have been execut
ed in Ireland, Harold J. Tennant, par
liamentary under-secretary for war,
told a questioner in the house of com
mons today. Seventy-three persons
have received sentences of penal serv
itude and six of imprisonment at
hard labor, the under-secretary added.
TO URGE WILSON
FOR A MEDIATOR
New York, May 11. In response to
an appeal from The Netherlands anti
war council a meeting at which will
be considered a proposal that Presi
dent Wilson be urged to promote a
conference of neutral nations to offer
mediation in the European war, will
be called soon in this country. This
was announced today by Hamilton
Holt, chairman of the American
branch of the central organization for
durable peace, the recipient of the ap
peal. The communication urged coopera
tion by American peace societies in
bringing about mediation. The ap
peal of the Dutch council, according to
Mr. Holt, indicates belief by many
persons in The Netherlands that Em
peror William, through Germany's re
ply to tbe American note in the sub
marine controversy, made an indirect
bid for peace.

CHICAGO STRIKE
IS MORE SERIOUS
Difficult Situation, Involving Thou
sands of Men of Various Industries
Grows in Intensity.
Chicago, May 11. Chicago's strike
situation involving thousands of men
in various industries, appears today
to be more serious than at any time
since the strikes started. The walk
out of clothing workers is the most
serious of the present troubles and
this promises, to become more wide
spread.
According to figures given out by
officials of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America, more than fifteen
hundred cutters and tailors employed
by half a dozen large clothing con
cerns struck yesterday, making a total
of more than two thousand clothing
workers who have quit work. Today
several thousand tailors will walk out,
according to A. D. Marimpietrie, gen
eral executive counselman of the
clothing makers' union.
"The tailors will strike at every
establishment where there has been a
walkout of cutters," he said. "We de
mand shorter hours, increased wages
and recognition of the union."
Franklin Rosebaum, member of the
general executive of the union, pre
dicts that from 8,000 to 10,000 clothing
workers will be on strike before night.
He said plans had been laid for a "100
per cent" walkout.
Jacob J. Abt, president of the Whole
sale Clothiers association, said that the
manufacturers would not give up their
open shop policy and do not intend to
agree to arbitration.
Other strikes in the city at present
are, with the number of men estimated
to be involved in each, as follows:
International Harvester company,
more than five thousand; 426 street
cleaners; tannery workers, 3,000; iron
moulders and foundrymen, 3,000;
screw workers, 2,000; terra cotta
workers, 600; spring makers, 400;
piano makers, 500; stock yards em
ployes, 500; various small strikes in

border patrol by mounting 2,000 In
fantrymen on Texas ponies. The gen
eral plans to make this recommenda
tion to Secretary Lansing because the.
available forces of cavalry for patrol
purposes have become practically ex

that Texas ponies are suited for pa
trol work, being able to maintain them
selves on the scanty grass along the
Mexican border where the regular cav
alry mounts are hardly able to exist.
After Glenn Springs Bandits.
General Funston said he thought that
Major Langhorne and his troops of th
Eighth cavalry were well over the Rio
Grande into Mexico today and that th
Americans had a good chance of at
least overtaking part of the bandita
who raided Glenn Springs, as some ofi
them had loaded down wagons with;
loot which would retard their retreat.

Funston, representing the United

The conference, which may be the last,

Obegon Holding Negotiations.
Upon General Obregon depends to
day the outcome of the negotiations
between him and Generals Scott and
Funston some days ago. Unless he
signed the agreement entered into by
him and General Scott, or was pre

' appeared probable that the American

Washington the uselessness of further
parleys.
Mexican officers in Juarez did not
