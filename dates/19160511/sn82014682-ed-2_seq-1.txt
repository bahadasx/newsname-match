Attempted Attack With Knife
Last Night Rouses Resi- "
, dents to Action
Culminating a long series of hold
ups, burglaries and attempted assaults
In Manca valley,1 an unknown man last
night -seized and threatened the wife
of a well-known businessman of the
city and then, put to flight by the
woman's tqulckness and pluck, disap
peared In the darkness, v
1 Aa a result of this and" other Inci
dents showing that one or jmote law
less characters may continue depre
dationg In the valley, residents of the
section began today an organized plan
for measures of self-defense:5 ?
A group of husbands met this morn
ing 'and decided to contribute; to a
Jfjind to bring from the coast a blood
(bound trained In the pursuit of crim
V I tnoto' tri- t Anvr lr, thai a- 1
at, aiyme centra J spot where his ser
vices are Quickly available almost
anywhere in. the section; and to. em
ploy a keeper who will .wort: 'with the
animal in running down criminal tres
passers.- ; v'.
Furthermore, . representatives of
Mahoa valley residents called on Cap
tain Of Detectives McDuffie this morn-
ing iqt aia ana ne win Degin lnsiruc
tion of women of tbe valley in the use
of reyolvera.vTwIce a week, beginning
as eoon is it can be arranged, shooting
classes for. women will be held with
McDuffie as instructor. Hereafter it
is probable, that a large number, of
Manoa women if they go out at night
without male escort even for a visit
with the neighbor, will be armed with
a businesslike "gun." Police whistles
will also be supplied them. '
. Last Right's incident was one of a
number In the past two years which
have i thoroughly stirred 'up Manoa
folk. One of , the Manoa women went
to visit a neighbor only a few. rods
away, at about 7 -in the evening On
her way-home a small man approach
ed her and began asking questions
about . the ;"cook-man," his dialect
strongly suggesting, that he; was an
Oriental.-., Thinking. at first that he
was merely trying to find some friend,
the woman i antwered his ... questions.
Suddenly he drew and brandished a
large" knife; talking almost unintellig
ibly but leaving no doubt as to the
seriousness of his threats. ;
,Te. woman shoved him,, backward
with a quick push and screamed loud
ly and the man turned and fled. Neigh
bors heard the call and came hurrying
to the scene. - They found prints of
the man's shoes in. the mud. He is
described as a small man.
Telephone notice to the police
station brought four detectives to the
scene, but without result , Today oth
ers are combing the valley, but little
hope is expressed that they will get
the trespasser. As in several previous
cases he : has suddenly appeared,
threatened women and - disappeared
without leaving any good identifica
tion clue. "
That is the reason it is proposed to
get a bloodhound trained in tracking
men.' If such an animal had been
available last night the Manoa men
think it could have ..been put on the
man's trail In 15 minutes after he fled
through the dusk. . .
An 18-year-pld youth, Joe Joseph,
went to jail today for six months.' He
was found guilty' in police court of
second-degree larceny. Joe has been
in jail before and is a graduate, as the
prosecution put 1 1 4 of the . reform
school. ,vHis last, offense was stealidg
a shirt, a pair of pants and a pair of
shoes from George Richardson's
store on Kukui street on April 29. V
