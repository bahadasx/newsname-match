number deported from Ireland was
givenN^s 1,706. Those deported have
not yet Jaeen tried and are still in the

Irish affairs occupied today even a
more important position in the public
mind than they did at the time of, the
.home rule controversy,. Both houses of
parliament t*re again engaged with
them today.
John Dillon's motion for discussion
of the executions in Ireland comes up
in the house of commons and the house
of lords is considering Lord Loreburn's
motion expressing dissatisfaction with
the Irish administration
The debateUn the house of commons
is regarded' a& the more important, for
there the'government comes under-the
cross Are of the whole Irish party and
of a large numberXof liberal members
who are determined to not only bring
an 'end to executions In Irelam but to
martial law as well.
Arrests Number Thousands.

County Cork, althb it came before
Premier Asquith gave his assurance
that no further death sentences would'
be earrleM tiw^ebate,

the Irtslr members.
fbe number of arrests -have notryet'
been made known but' It must be sev

which 400 were killed. These flgiires
include soldiers, insurgents and civ
ilans. '.v'

since the insi£rection there has been
an increase in the rate of recruiting
there. -jj
Even while the controversy "over the
causes and .manner of handling the in
-surrection is still in progress efforts
are being made- to reach- a compromise
on the home rule question".
Thoae who most desire this are urg
ing that Lord Hardinge, after- he has
concluded his inquiry into the disturb
ances, shall be appointed lord lieuten

Premier Asquith announced in the
house of commons this-afterhoon that

GIVES $100,000 TO
FIGHT TUBERCULOSIS
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
Makes Cash Donation to National
Society—To Conduct Community Ex
periment.
Washington, May 11.—Announcement
was made of a gift of $100,000 to the
National Association For the Study
and Prevention of Tuberculosis by Dr.
E. R. Baldwin, president of that body,
at its opening session today. The gift
is from the Metropolitan Life. Insur
ance Company and is given for the
purpose of demonstrating by a com
munity experiment for three years that
tuberculosis can be controlled just the
same as any other Infectious disease if
right methods and adequate resources
re available. It la planned to select a
own or city of about. &,0W> inhabitants»
pro.bably.to "New York or Massachusetts
an d" to apply there' all-o^ the k*owled*e
on the treatment and prevention of tu
berculosis available, with a view to the
ultimate eradication of the diMgse. If
•the national association can demon
strate that tuberculosis can be con
trolled In one community, it will start
a campaign to apply this knowledge to
every city and town in the United
States.
Dr. Baldwin also emphasized the
most significant developments in the
anti-tuberculosis field during the past
year.
"In our educational campaign," he
said, "we are applying more Intensive
methods of group education in schools,
churches, lodges, labor union?and even
among physicians and nurses.
"The last year has aUo witnessed
'"some significant administrative devel
opments. The decided movement in the
direction of standardization of methods
of work Is highly commendable. The
Interest taken in the interstate or fed
eral relation to the tuberculosis prob
lem is most significant. Research, both
into the medical and social causes of
tuberculosis, is being emphasized anew.
The national association must answer
many Important questions before it can
go much farther with its work. More
research is needed to do this. It Is
gratifying to note the ever-increasing
amount of money being spent in the
anti-tuberculosis campaign. In 1905
hardly more than $5,000,000 was spent
in tuberculosis work, mostly for treat
ment. In 191-5 over $22,500,000 was ex
pended. From 1905 the percentage of
public funds expended in tuberculosis
has increased from 25 to 65 per cent,
indicating that the communities are
more and more realizing their responsi
bility in the fontrol of tuberculosis."
Dr. Charles J. Hatfield, executive sec
retary of the association reported new
organization in almost every part of
the country and an increase of more
than 3.500 in the number of agencies
engaged In the anti-tuberculosis fight.
The death rate in the larger cities has
shown a decline during the last ten
years—in somjg of them more than 30
per cent, and on an average of 20 per
cent.
The Red Cress Chrlitmas Seal sale
for 19IS reached a total of 80,000,000
seals sold, bringing in a gross revenue
to the anti-tuberculosis movement of
nearly $800,000.
