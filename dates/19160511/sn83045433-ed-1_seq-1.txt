TEXT OF GERMAN NOTE
Ambassador Gerard to the Secretary of
State.
American Fmbassy.
Herlin, May F.
Following to translation of the text of
note upon which ety telegramot numbter
thiry-eight fifty-eright, was based:
'Supplementing his note of the fourth
instant, con--erning the cooduct of the
*terman submarine warfare, the tder
signed han the honor to inform his ex
colency. the Ailtrican Ambassador. Mr.
James t Gerard, that the further in
resti ation made by the German naval
authorities concerned, in regard to the
French steamship Sussex, n the basis
of the Arneriat material, has been eon
luded in th mcantime. In conformity
with the result of thin investigation the
astutption ,xpressed in th- rote of the
undersigned of the tenth ultino. that the
damage of the Sussex was to he traced
back to a eause other than the attack of
a Grman submarine, cannot he main
tarn, d.
German stand Inplalnel.
'Such an asuption had to be ar
riveri at nith certainty from the material
in; the peeseeoion of the German govern
ment. for itself. and without future
knowledge of the circumstances con
neeted with the torpedoing of the Sus
' , th. mn re s., as apart from the points
.numerated in the note of the tenth ul
ttmo, th foll.n facto had come to
the attention of -i miralty staff of the
:avy through t-hail information;
.\lar,-h _4, 1'a,;, ap roxiinattelv at the same
time t the Pusx. an auxiliary warshti
left the port of Folkstone with a large
transport of iiriti h infantry on board;
on th.- sam~ day transport steamer was
torpedoed in th channH: : f,-w minutes
I rrceding the explosion on the cussex,
sh, had passed through a mass of ship
wreckage, whi h created the impression
that a ship hadt sunk at that spot shortly
tfote. All these facts justitled the con
cl Ision at the only rase of torpedoing
.thich 'o d he c onsidced under the cir
umstanccs. had struck the British war
Ness"'. whereas the Sussex had toet with
an accident in some other way.
ioweter on the basis of the American
material, the German government can
not withhold its conviction that the
snip torpedoed by the German submarine
is in fact identical with the Suscex. for
in accordance with this material the
plave the time. and the effet of the
explosion by which the Sussex was
dtamtaged, arer in the essential dotails
with the statements of the German com
mander. so that there cis no longer b
any h-pntion of the possibility of two
modepetirent oc-urrences.
Torpedo Fragments Fonnd.
An additional reason is constituted by
the fact that offi-er of the American
nay found fragments of an explosive in
the old of thi- Sussex which are de
ocr:ed by them upon firm grounds as
parts of a German torpedo.
Finally the counter evidence which
was dedlucdl in the note of the tenth
ultimo fr-tom the di'firenie in appearance
of the vesseo des tibed by the submarine
commnandrr and the only reproduction of
the Siisx then aailable, has proven to
he untenable, inasmuch as according to
a photograph of the damaged Sussex
now to hand. the characteriste gistine
tions no longer existed at the time of
the a-cident; while the Sussex In the
photograph of my Daity Graphic inctoned
in the note only carried one mast and
also showed the white gangway custom
ary on passenger vessels on the level
with the port holes 0. V. S.. the repro
duction of the damaged Sussex shows a
erond mast and a uniform dark color.
and thus approaches in her outer ap
nearance the description of the vessel as
ftrnished hr the submarine commander.
"In view of the general impression
of all the facts at hand, the German
government considers it beyond doubt
that the commander of the subma
rine acted in the bona fide belief that
he was facing an enemy warship.
On the other hand it cannot he denied
that. misled by the apearance of the
vessel. under the pressure of the cir
cumstan-es, he formed his judgment
too hurriedly in establishing her char
acter and did not therefore act fully
in accordance with the strict instruc
tion which called upon him to exercise
particular care.
Germany Exriesea Regret.
In view of these ctrcumtaces. the
German govern ment franhiy admits
that th exessurance given to the Ameri
can government, In accordance with
which passnenger vessels were cot to

hero adhered to in the present case.
