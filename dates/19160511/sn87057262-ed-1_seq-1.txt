proposal for a co-operative border

While negotiations stood at a dead
lock today the following things were
happening:
Militia of Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico hurried into concentration
camps to be assigned to border patrol
duty.
General Funston asked the war de
partment for permission to mount
2.000 infantrymen to assist in guard
ing the 2,200 mile line.
General Pershing contracted his
line to 150 miles with Colonla Oublan
the southernmost base.
Nearly 3.000 regular troops. Includ
ing coast and field artillery and in
fantry, started for the border, drain
ing the country of the last available
regulars.
American cavalrymen of the Eighth
and Fourteenth regiments crossed
the border of the Texas Big Bend in
search of Glenn Springs raiders.
The concentration of the army In
northern Mexico was closely veiled
by censorship, but it was generally
understood here the move is designed
to meet any Carranzista move that
'might follow breaking off of negotia

question which General Scott is pow

entire negotiations being switched to
Washington for adjustment by the
state department.
Despite the increased tension along
the border there was still a prospect
of peaceful settlement Friction, how
ever. between the military forces, has
reached the danger point and offi
cials believed peace will be hard to
maintain unless a settlement is speed
ily reached.
General Carranza is blocking a
settlement on the plan to which Scott
and Obregon tentatively agreed in be
half of their government in their sec
ond conference. Succeeding meetings
have found Carranza on the ground
with new demands and suggestions,
but the contentions have been turned

Scott. Carranza, however, stood pat

critical stage, the American troops, it
was believed here, have been ordered
to take no chances on an adverse
break in diplomatic developments.
Following reports of additional
raids in the United States, General
Funston today received messages from
nearly every point along the border
demanding more troops. The demands
will be met as far as possible with
the militia and additional regulars,
Funston said.
American Consul Edwards at Juarez
today denies he had ordered American
civilians out of Chihuahua state on
the advice of the state department.
He said, however, the policy of the
state department to discourage Am
ericans from entering the district was
still in force.
Another Raid.
MARATHON, Texas. May 11.—The
bandit raid at Blocker, Texas, today
convinced federal investigators along
the border that an organized system
of assaults of American border settle
ments is being carried out. Officials
expected further attempts on small
towns within the next few days and
laid plans to thwart the raiders.
Fifty bandits swooped down on
Blocker, near Eagle Pass, looted the
store of the Blocker and Ford ranches
and made off with a number of horses.
There were no fatalities, according to
advices reaching the base.
Civilians along the border banded
together for protection, when it be
came known that thore are two armed
Mexican forces not far from the Big
Bend border. One force was reported
between Boquillas and Ojinaga, Mex
ico. and another a short distance west
of Ojinaga. A number of small settle
ments within striking distance of the
Mexican camps were prepared to
fight to prevent the bands from cross
ing the border in their neighborhood.
Government agents believe the Mexi
can bands are working with one an
other, participating in alternate raids
and maintaining a central headquar
ters at a point In Mexico within a
short ride of the international line.
Every Mexican on the American
side was regarded with suspicion.
The so-called friendly Mexicans,
whom American residents have long
regarded as entirely trustworthy, were
regarded with suspicion as possible
agents of the raiders. Government
agents believe the raiders obtain in
timate information regarding the
settlements from Mexicans living In
the United States and divide their
loot with their informers.

CHALLENGE TO AIR DUEL
FOR WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIP
Navarre, a smooth faced French
youth, has fought more than tifty air
duels. Through each encounter he
wore wrapped about his neck a silk
stocking given him by a French
beauty for "good luck."
Navarre's methods of fighting are
entirely different from those of Lieu
tenant Immelman, who swoops down
upon his pr«y from a great height,
shooting as he passes, but failing to
return to the attack if the enemy
aeroplane Is not brought aown. The
French flier dashes straight for his
enemy, circles him. worries him with
a disconcerted fire and dives and
dips to avoid bullets. Navarre pur
sues if th« enemy flees, gyrating like
a bee over and above the enemy with
his machine gun popping.
A year ago Navarre battle victori
ously against five enemy aeroplanes,
bringing down two and escaped un
harmed. On another occasion he was
reprimanded for escorting a German
flyer whom he shot down behind the
French lines, to a nearby wine shop,
where he treated him to drinks.

strengthen their case against Mrs.
Amy 13. Areher-Gilligan, the pro

is to determine whether they died of
arsenic poison, now fixed as the
cause of the Andrews death.
In a statement issued through her
attorney, Mrs. Areher-Gilligan has
declared her innocence. The defend
ant said she is being persecuted.
Benedict M. Holden. her attorney,

FRANCE
•PARIS, May 11.—French troops re
pulsed with bayonets and grenade*
an attack delivered by the Germans
early this morning west of the Vaux
pond, northeast of Verdun. On the
west bank of the Meuse, only artil
lery activity occurred during last
night, the war office reported, the
Germans failing to return to the at
taok.
French artillery throughout last
night displayed unusual activity in
the Champagne region, concentrating
Its fire on German positions south,
east of Tahure. About 110 yards of
German trenches were destroyed.
Four French war planes bombard
ed the railway stations at Damvlllera
and Etain last night, setting fire to
a railway depot.
Though German artillery continues
active on the west bank of the Meuse,
evidently In preparation for renewed
attacks, the impression is again
growing in the French capital that
the Germans are preparing to aban
don the attack on Verdun. In this
connection the statement spread
broadcast by the German semi-of
ficial news agency yesterday with
referenoe to the number of troops In
volved was cited.
French officers ridiculed the state
ment that 800/XX) French troops were
engaged at Verdun. They said the
German government undoubtedly
caused such a statement to be pub
lished to prove to the German peo
ple that the crown prince was con
fronted with tremendous obstacles at
Verdun, thus explaining the failure of
his attempt to take the fortress.

NEW YORK. May 11.—It Is up to

Members of the progressive nation

today, following a conference yester

the party was "for peace" but not for
peace at any price. The executive
committee discussed convention ar
rangements and possibly the tempo

for suspicion that if the republican
party makes the right sort of a move
—concedes enough, in the direction of
the Americanism for which the pro
gressives stand—the progressive ar
rangements will simmer down to ths
proper way in which to make a tri

Rumor In Italy That Every Other
