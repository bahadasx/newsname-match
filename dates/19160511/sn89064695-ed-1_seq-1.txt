Senator Moses E, Glapp
In Accord With The
People Of Minnesota.
That Senator Moses E. C'app
has always beon in accord with
public sentiment, and that his
votes in the U. S. Senate have
been recorded as a majority of the
peoole of the State would have
registered their ov\n opinions, is a
fact clearly borne out by the offi
cial records.
In the bro-id struggle which al
wa.vs has existed, and exists today,
between the efforts of the few to

ATOR, MOSES E. OLAPP.
control the government in then
interests, and the welfare of the
many for whom government was
really instituted, a struggle which
formed an important part of those
great policies which came to be
known as "The Roosevelt Princi
pies," the Senator took an active
part, and was an advocate of those
measures vhich became laws, and
which were approved by the ma
jority of the voters.
The first thing of importance
taken up by Senator Glapp. when
he entered the Senate, was the
effort to ampnd the Constitution,
so that U. S. Senators should be
elected by a direct vote of the
people. He was an uncompro
raising champion of this amend
ment and the first U. S. Senator
from Minnesota to make speeches
in favor of popular elections of
Senators.
During his present term, on
July 31st, 1913, Senator Glapp
made this statement on the floor of
the Senate:
"During mv comparatively short
service in this body, I recall the
plea I made for the right of the
American people to elect Sena
tors of the United States, by di
rect vote, and I was met with
such scorn and derision by mem
bers of this body at that time, that
one distinguished Senator could
show his contempt in no other
wav than by arising in his place
and leaving this chnmber.*'
Passed The Anti-Rebate Bill.
In 1903, Senator Glapp, as a
member of the greit committee on
Interstate Commerce, had charge
of the anti rebate and anti-dis
crimination bills, and on February
3rd of that year he called up and
put through the anti-rebate bill
This law was attacked, and had to
run the gauntlet of the courts,
but was sustained at every point.

Subsequently nearly all the suits
brought against combinations were
brought under this law. In 1900,
when there was such a protracted
struggle in the Senate over the
Hepburn bill, which finally gave
the Interstate Commerce Com
mission the right to fix rates,
Clapp and Dolliver were the lead
ing advocates of this legislation
and its passage was largely due to
the efforts of Senator Clapp.
Agaij in 1910, when a great
effort was made to repeal railroad
legi&latioD, Senators Clapp and
Cummins brought in the minority
report condemning the action of
the majority of the committee, and
pointed out the reactionary feat
ures of the proposed legislation.
In the end, every item they op
posed was stricken out, except the
one providing for a Commerce
Court, and that was repealed at
the following session.
Opposed Free Trade With Canada.
When the attempt was made in
1911, to subject the farmers of
Minnesota to free trade with
China, Clapp was a vigorous
opponent of the bill, speaking
several times in opposition.
Meanwhile he had risen to the
position of Chairman of the com
mittee on Interstate Commerce,
and about the first thing he did
was to offer and pass a resolution
providing for an investigation into
trusts and corporations engaged in
interstate commerce. This was
followed by a far-reaching and ex
hiustive series of hearings and in
vestigation lasting more than a
year, and which finally resulted ^n
^he passage of the "Federal Trade
Commission Bill and the Clayton
Anti-trust Act.
A Historic Investigation.
All through the summer months
of 1912, when Congress was in
session, and when it was in recess,
Clapp, as chairman of a special
committee to inquire into the
campaign methods, and the con
tributions employed in the presi
dential and congressional elec
tions of 19041908, and the prim
aries of 1912, conducted one of the
most sweeping inquisitions in the
history of Congress. He sent sub
poenas to men who have played
big politics in a big way during
the past decade, including a form
er President of the United States,
and a former candidate for that
office United States Senators and
Ex-senators Members and Ex
members of Congress also men
most prominent in the business
and financial world, including the
elder J. Pierpont Morgan, John
D. Arch bold, head of the Standard
Oil Company, Thomas F. Ryan,
Ogden Mills, Chauncey M. De
pew, W. R. Hearst, William
Flinn, Roger Sullivan, John D.
Weeks, now a presidential candi
date, Postmaster General Hitch
cock, and former Secretary of the
Treasury Cortelyou, and hundreds
of other witnesses.
Ciapp's Bill Passes Senate.
Even before the investigation
closed, Senator Clapp presented a
bill, which provides that it should
be unlawful for anybody, person,
firm, committee or corporation, to
send money from one state to an
other for campaign purposes, ex
cept for traveling and ordinary
expenses of Speakers, thus cutting
out the large contributions which
have in limes gone by been sent
from New York City to help carry
"The Doubtful States." This bill
has parsed the Senate of the United
States. Another bill by Senator
Clapp forbjds any Senator, or mem
ber of the House, to solicit cam
paign funds for himself or any
political organization.

tion of a government armor plate
plant and thus relieve the question
of National Defense from the in
fluence of private gain, thereby
releasing the hold that the armor
plate and the steel trust have had
on Uncle Sam for years, Clapp
has been active from the start un
til the bill passed the Senate. It
was his vote in the Committee on
Naval Affairs that decided the
deadlock as between a govern
ment plant or allowing the trusts
to keep on, although after the
bill passed the armor plate people
immediately offered to sell their
products to the government at $30
a ton le?s than the price they have
been receiving. Clapp has been
actiye in reporting out of com
mittee the Child Labor Bill, the
Spanish American War Widows'
Bill, and is an ardent supporter of
a civil service retirement measure
beginning with employees of the
U. S. Postal Service.
The
During the past winter a decid
ed and noticeable change in favor
of the Chippewas at least has tak
en place in the Indian office at
Washington there has not been so
much quibbling over technicalities,
and every Indian has not been
treated as though he was familiar
with the legal questions which
would require attorneys to over
come.
During the past winter the
Chippewas in general have had* no
cause, so far as can be learned, to
find fault with their treatment so
far as the Washington Indian
office is concerned.
It has always been the field ser
vice where the principal sources
of complaints have arisen, and it
has been in the Indian office at
Washington that it was expected
that these complaints, or their
causes, would be remedied.
The Van Metre Bill Re
ferred To A Sub-Com-
mittee.
The Van Metre bill which Rep
resentative Seenerson introduced
in Congress to give probate courts
of Minnesota jurisdiction over In
dian estates upon this reservation,
was referred to a sub committee
of the House of Representatives.
With the strong opposition there
is to it in its present form it is
very doubtful if it can be passed
at the present session of Congress
if at all.
The Chippewa delegates now
at Washipgton will try and secure
some amendments to the bill as in
its present form it aims to legis
late out of both the United States
and the courts of Minnesota some
cases that are now pending there.
THE RIGHT OF NOMINATION
BILL.
It is learned that the Right of
Nomination Bill is still before
Congress in a more modified form
than it was when introduced first
by.Senator Johnson of South Da
kota.
The Indians who are still at
Washington, and throughout the
country generally, are urging the
bill, and if they will continue to
keep it up as persistently as they
are now doing, their efforts will
eventually be rewarded, and all
THE TOMAHAWK can say is, keep
op with the gpo4 work,

The Steenerson School
Bill Favorably Re
ported.
Representative Steenerson caused
the school bill, which he recently
introduced in Congress, to be fav
orably reported by the House In
dian committee.
A protest was m-ide against the
bill by the delegates who are now
at Washington to both the Indian
office and Mr. Steenerson, which
were published in a recent issue of
THE TOMAHAWK. The Indian
office immediately took up the
matter with Supt. Hinton here,
but had not received a reply from
him prior to the agreement to
make a favorable roport on the
bill.
The bill proposes to take from
the Chippewas the celebration
grounds here, and although Mr.
Steenerson led the delegates to be
lieve he would take into consider
ation the delegation's protests, he
failed to do this.
It is quite probable that further
efforts will be made by the dele
gation to defeat the bill entirely,
or have it referred to the mem
bers of this reservation to vote
upon for their approval or disap
proval.

Some Minnesota Con
gressmen Ignore Gen
eral Council Represen
tatives.
Whenever a tribe of Indians
appoint delegates to visit Wash
ington for the purpose of attend
ing to tribal matters, they do not
expect that the work of these dele
gates will be set a*ide or ignored
at the request of persons either of
the tribe or otherwise, but unfor
tunutely this has been the case
during the past winter.
There have been several mat
ters of legislation which effected
the Chippewas of Minnesota ex
clusively, but the Chippewa delo
gates had apparently no more in
fluence with some Congressmen
than the "kickers" from this res
ervation.
It is suggested that hereafter
whenever the Chippewas send
delegates to Washington, thot-e
who send them should protest vio
lently against the voices of two or
three persons receiving any recog
nition, and especially where those
persons are holding on to their
rights here by a thread.

"Indian Day" Set Aside By
New York Governor To Pay
Tribute o' First Citizens'.
Albany, N. V.A proclamation
has been issued by Governor
Whitman, de-ignating May 13 as
"American Indian Day" for ob
servance by the descendants of the
first Americans in memorial and
honor of their forefathers. The
governor invited the attention of
the citizens of the state "to the
history, the social institutions of
these people and especially to the
present and future needs of the
5,000 reservation Indians novv
resident in this state."
The day will be celebrated by
Indians throughout the country,
but as far as known, New York is
the first state officially to recog
nize the proposed observance.
Exercises will be held in Indian
schools and reservations, and
preparations have been made in
numerous white schools and com
munities for considering the mu
tual interests, friendship and des
tiny of the two races.
The idea of celebrating Indian
day was adopted by the national
conference of Indians in Denver
in 1913. The date for the cele
brationthe second Saturday in
Maywas not fixed, however, un
til the Lawrence, Kansas, confei
ence last October.
