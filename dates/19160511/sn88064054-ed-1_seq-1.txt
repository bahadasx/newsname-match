WHITE CARNATION
TO BE WORN SUNDAY
Western Union Have Spec
ial Blanks For Mothers
Messages
The second Sunday in May is
Mother's Day. This year it falls on
next Sunday May 14. It will be
observed in a most fitting manner
at Goodyear Park. The beautiful
thought of setting aside one day in
the year to be particularly devoted
to one's mother was first suggested
by Miss Anna Jarvis of Philadel
phia who founded the Mothers' Day
International Association to provide
the necessary organized support for
the fostering of the movement.
Thanks largely to her efforts Moth
er's Day has become a recognized
institution as the day on which
each of us should pause to acknowl
edge our debt of affection and grati
tude to "the best mother that ever
lived," on which we should be with
her if we can, and if we unfortu
nately can't should make a point of
sending her a message of affection
and cheer.
In co-operation with the effort to
foster the observance of Mother's
Day, the Western Union Telegraph
Company have provided special
telegraph blanks appropriately de
corated with an artistic design of
carnations and bearing the legend
"Mother's Day," on which all mes
sages of those who wish to send a
word of greeting to their mothers
on this occasion by day letter or
night letter, or in a short telegram,
will be delivered.
The emblem of the day is, the
white carnation and it is the hope
of the Mothers' Day Association
that it will be worn by everyone as
a tribute of respect, not only for his
own mother, but also for all of the
gentle and noble motherhood of the
land'

Frank Hosey, a deputy sheriff of "

Mood? a successful farmer, is
at his h;.me near here as a
result of a shooting affray which
occured about 4 miles from Boga
lusa, in Pearl River county, Miss..
at 5:20 Monday afternoon. The
cause of the shooting is said
to have dated back for several
months, but renewed Monday.
, Moody and Hosey have not been
on the best of terms for several
months. On Sunday Mr. Moody
entertained some friends who had
intended fishing but owing to high
waters were unable to do so. Ac
cording to the most reliable infor
mation, when he returned home
from Bogalusa Monday afternoon *
he was told that Hosey had passed
some remarks about his company,
Moody decided to correct the mis

drove to the home of Ward
Wheat. Before any words had
passed between Moody and Hosey,
so the story is told by friends of
Mr.' oody, Hosey ran behind Na
wagon in front of the Wheat home
and begun to fire with an automatic
shot gun. Moody then returned the
fire and Mr. Seals then drew bi
revolver. The first shot struck
Hosey, breaking his arm. Thirty
six shots were fired in all, several
taking effect in Hosey's body. Al
most a full charge of the gun shot
struck young Seals in the abdomen.
at the same instant Hosey was
shot in the abdomen by Seals.
Hosey and Seals were brought to
the Bogalusa Hospital where Hosey
tdied at one o'clock Tuesday morn
[ing and Seals expired at 5:10 the
same afternoon.
SLittle is know of Hosey except
that he came to that vicinity about
three years ago. A few weeks ago
he was appointed as a deputy sher
iff. He was living on a farm owned
by Will Straham only a short dis
Stance from the Moody farm. He
twas joined by his wife several
Smonths ago but neither have dis
r cussed their past residence with the
t neighbors and friends. The remains
I were laid to rest in Bogalusa Tues
I day.
J. B. Purvis, of Bogalusa, stated
i Tuesday that he had known Hosey
) forabout 12 years and that Hoaey
had worked for his relatives, and
one time told them that there was
Sa big reward out for him. He would
Inever tell where he was from or
why he was wanted by the oficials~
Ja. Seal was married and about
24 years of age. He was consider
ed an industrious and poUlar
I voung man. Mr. Moody owns a
g large farm about a mile from the
it Mississippi line and is well and
L- favorably known in Bogalusa. His
e injuries consist of five buck shot,
. two are thought to have penetrated
the lungs, but Mr. Moody stated
Tuesday that he was not suffering
to any great extent and would be
alright in a few days. His friends
are considerably worried over his
condition however.
1 The remains of young Seals were
h laid to rest at White Sands Miss.,

crowd attended the services.
t Sheriff Tate arrived at the scene
id of the shooting early Tuesday to
make an investigation.
