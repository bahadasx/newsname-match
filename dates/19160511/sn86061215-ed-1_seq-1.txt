CALLING ON GOVERNMENT
TO END BORDER WAR.
Austin, Tex., May 10.—Governor
James F. Ferguson of Texas on his re
turn- to Austin last night Issued a
signed statement in which he declared
that now was the proper time for
United States intervention In Mexi
co to restore order in that country,
"if it takes ten or fifty years."
The statement says in part:
"Since we have started we may as
well finish the Job. A temporary pro
tection of the border will accomplish
nothing. If we catch a^d punish one
bandit horde another takes its place
tomorrow. If a ruler is put in power
today he is betrayed tomorrow. Loy

soil now gives us Justification and it
is now our duty to do whatever Is
necessary to permanently prevent a
recurrence of further outrages against
our people. To do less will be to
shirk our duty to our national honor
and our duty to the Mexican people."

CATCHES THIEF
G. W. Killinger Frustrates
Attempt of Dip to Get
Away With His Purse
GRABS HAND OF ONE
TAKING WALLET
Plain Clothes Officers on
Street Car Arrest Pair
Without Any Trouble
Two Chicago dips were unsuccessful
in their attempt to relieve G. W. Kil
linger, manager of the Ottumwa
Moline Pump & Engine Co., when in
the Illinois metropolis Tuesday, of his
purse with a 'large sum of money in it.
Mr. Killinger returned Tuesday night
from a business trip in Chicago and
\his morning the press of that city
carried the following story on the at
tempted robbery of the Ottumwan:
G. W. Killinger from Ottumwa, la.,
viewed the passing landscape from
within a west bound Madison street
car yesterday. One hand was holding
a strap and the other a suit case, and
he was minding his own business.
Two men worked their way from the
rear platform and one touched Killing
er on the elbow.
"Here's your purse,'' he said.
"By cracky!" said Killinger. "It's
got $1,000 in it. Wait here till I call a
policeman."
"We're policemen,"
waB
the re­
joinder.
"Well, say can't you catch them
pickpockets
"We've got 'em.**
And Detective Sergeants Crowley
and Lavin escorted George Williams
and Charles Hoffman to a place with
steel bars around it. Williams and
Hoffman said they were just in from
New York.
"I thought I didn't recognize 'em,"
observed Lavin.
Catches the "Dip" in the Act.
Mr. Killinger when seen relative to
his Chicago street car experience, said
that his purse had not been taken
from him, but that instead he had dis
covered the pair of "dip#" at work on
him and caught the hand of one while
it was in his pocket. He tells the fol
lowing story of the incident:
"I was on a street car bound for
the Northwestern station and having]
to stand up owing to the crowded con-i
ditlon of the car, felt myself jostled I
about, especially by a man before me
and one behind. The fellow in front'
seemed to be awfully nervous and his
twitching about was apparently a:
means to attract my attention while
his pal operated on my pockets. Scent- jng 1135
ing their purpose, I worked my way
toward the door of the car determined
that they would not get off before we
got to the station where I was siire
some officers were available.
"To better guard my person, I
changed my grip from the hand I had
carried it in, to the other hand and
feeling the man behind me trying to
get into my pocket, I grabbed his hand
before he got my purse.
"It happened that two plain clothes
men were on the car and they caught
sight of the two pickpockets and com
ing up arrested both of them.
"That Chicago paper story is all
right only it deals too strongly in
puffery of the police force. My money
had not been taken because I caught
the hand of the thief. It is true that
they arrested the men whom I was
determined would not leave the car
until I could get an officer. When they
made known to me that they were
plain clothes men, they asked if I
would come to Chicago to appear
against the men if needed and I told
them I would because I believe society
Is best rid of their kind."

OWANS TO BARE HEADS
Governor Clarke Encouraging Move
ment for Unusual Observance of
Memorial Day.
Des Moines, May 10.—Governor
Clarke is encouraging a movement for
a general observation of Memorial
day in Iowa. He is urging that from
12 o'clock to 12:05 at noon on May
30, all Iowans stand with heads bared
in silent contemplation of the nation's
dead and the ideals for which they
died.
The governor was asked' to incor
porate this provision in his Memorial
day proclamation. It has not been the
custom to issue such a proclamation
but the governor feels it is a good sug
gestion and that it should be taken
up throughout the state.
George A. Newman, adjutant gener
al of the G. A. of Iowa, says that
although the order for Memorial day
issued by the G. A. R. did not include
the suggestion that five minutes at
noon on May 30 be given to silent
tribute to the soldier dead he be
lieves It is a good idea and is in favor
of carrying it out.

OVER THREE HUNDRED ROADS GO

Chicago, May 10.—All railway safety
records were broken in 1915 when
325 American roads, reporting to the

161,948 miles of line. It is stated that
this record of safe operation has never
been equaled by the railroads of any
other country in the world.
All American roads/ in 1915, operat
