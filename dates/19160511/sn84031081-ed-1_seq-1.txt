Com of tho FA I'aso conference be
tween Generals Scott, Funston and
obregon. Officials of both the War
and state departments aptJred con
fident that an agreement satisfactory
to both sides would be negotiated, al
though they hesitated to predict how
much more time might be requited.
Klisio Arredondo, Mexican ambus
sudor-designat culled on Counselor
Polk at the state department late in
the day. Both he and Mr. Folk said
tho visit had no significance and was
merely a general discussion of the
situation. Mr. Arredondo had 00 ad
ditional advices from his (overnmeBt
to present and Mr. Folk could give
him no news as to the conference, at
Kl Fuso.
Xo Formal t'ropoaltion, ,
Secretary Maker received a report
from General Scott on the long dis
cussion with General obregon last
night. It stated that while the Mexi
can war minister had talked oyer a
suggestion for co-operative border pa
trol, the proposition was not present
ed formally as a substitute for tho
protocol worked out previously. Gen
eral Scott did not transmit details of
the new discussion but indicated, that,
he expected General I ibregon to sub
mit his new plan later.
officials here thought It unlikely
President Witoon would accept any
agreement which looked to the with
drawal from Mexico of the American
troops, even with promises that a
complete patrol of the Mexican side
would bo established by the de facto
government. There was nothing to
indVcatH that (the president was in
clined to change his decision that
General Pershing's forces will remain
In Mexico until tho de facto govern
ment has demonstrated beyond ques
tion its ability to control the situation
there.
Mere Prouiisi-s BumfflOSMtt.
No official has been willing to dis
cuss just what such a demonstration
must be; but it is certain that a men
assertion by General Carranza or Gen
eral Obregon will not be sufficient,
The course of General Obregon at
Kl Faso has been puzzling. Adminis
tration officials have had reuson to
believe that General Carranza has
given hin assent to the agreement as
Originally framed except In minor de
tails. The plan was suggested in part
at leasst by Oenerai Obregon hlmeir
when tbe cmiterees first met; yet Ob
regon has 'refused thus far to ex
change nttiflcations with General
Soott.
Optimism Prevsils.
In some quarters it was thought thl
Mexican war minlsster might be seek
ing political benefit from the tactics
he has adopted. There is no official
information tending to support tills
view, although intimations of friction
between Carranza and his wnr min
ister have been published frequently.
It is not believed here that political
manipulation of this sort, if it does
exi'f, will be prolonged to the point,
of causing a break with the Fnited
States. A feeling of optimism as W
the final result of the conference is
based largely upon tills view and also
upon the fact that General Scott has
giyH no indication that he thought
an agreement could not be reached.
Secretary Faker eaid the delay prob
ably was due to the difficulty of re
viewing incidental points in finding
a common ground o which the con
ferees could agree.
Mohili7atloii Continues.

messages dealing with the movements

tlie following facts had come to the
attention of the admiralty of the navy
through reliable information
"March 24, I9F!, approximately at
