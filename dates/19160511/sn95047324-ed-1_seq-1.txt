Reports 'indicate that mole
crickets are damaging gardens
and vegetables. These pests arc
similar to other crickets except
that they are lighter colored and
their front legs are adapted to
burrowing. They live in the
ground during the day and come
out at night to feed on vegetab
les while the unsuspecting gar
dener is asleep. '
J. R. Watson, entomologist to
the University of Florida Experi
ment Mation, recommends poi
son bait for them. A mixture in
the proportion of 100 pounds of
low grade flour to 2 or 2 1-2
pounds of paris green will at
tract many of the posts. Place
the bait in a small ring or furrow
around the plant.

Board Plans to Furnish"
Wbitefly Fungus
The fungi which prey on white
fly are among the best friends
which the citrus grower has. But
it will not be possible -to distrib
ute these fungi from grove to
grove this year because the State
Plant Board has restricted the
transportation of parts of citrus
trees. Dr. E. W. Berger, entomo
logist to the Board, is planning
to furnish one of these fungi, the
red, to citrus growers. A charge
sufficient to cover cost of produc
tion will be made.'
About 1000 pure cultures are
growing in the laboratories now.
It is planned to supply this fun
gus to those who .desire it by the
time the rainy season begins. The
office has no means of knowing
how many cultures will be reauir-
ed. Consequently,, A. C. Mason,
assistant entomologist, suggests
that growers place their orders !
immediately so that plans can be
made for supplying them. Ad-

Board, University of Florida.

Somebody is always calling at
tention to that old story about
the chain and its weakest link.
Well, it is a good story in some
cases. Take the citrus tree for
instance. Suppose a grower be
lieves in raising good fruit and
spend considerable suins of mon
ey in putting his grove in good
bearing condition. Suppose that
ho cultivates and prunes, and
raises cover crops, and fertilizes
and does everything but take
care of the whitefly. Now, what
is the use of doing anything at all
to that grove if the whitefly is
given free reign? 1
The damage caused fy white
flies is threefold, according to J.
R. Watson, entomologist to the
University of Florida Experi
ment Station. First, they draw
sap from the tree and weaken its
ability to produce fruit. Second,
they excrete honeydew which
serves as a medium for sooty
mold which in turn shades the
leaves and reduces their function
and necessitates washing the
fruit. Third, they indirectly fos
ter purple scales.
Each method of damage is seri
ous and may singly or in combi
nation neutralize any previous
precautions for a good crop. Any
grower who has whiteflies in his
grove and has not sprayed should !
do so ' at once. This is the first
brood. There will be two others
which will need attention, but
they can be controlled more easi
ly if the spring brood is taken
care of. Spraying is especially
important this spring because re
strictions have been pfciced on the
shipment of fungous material
from groves. The dry weather has
probably injured the fungi which
are already in the grove so that
importations would be necessary.
J he paraffin oil sprays are rec
ommended for this brood. In
st ructions can be found in Bulle

At a meeting held in Jackson
ville on April 25 an organization
to be known as the "Florida Cat

completed, and will begin active
operations. The committee is
composed of, J. M. Burguieres,
chairman; J. E. Ingraham, vice
chairman; Arthur C. Cummer,
treasurer; W. F. Coachman, sec
retary;, Clement S. Ucker and
Robert M. Pindoll, jr.; the last
named, being vice-president of the

Fort Ogden special drainage dis
trict under the provisions of sec
tion 956, general statutes of Flor

that the county attorney be di

Moved by D. L. Skipper, sec

carried, that the bond trustees of
the several special road nnrl
bridge districts of the county are
hereby required to render a re
port as required by section 801,
general statutes of Florida, on the
first day of June, 1916. and annu

Certainly does seem queer, that
Mexico can be a live issue and a
grave issue at the same time.
Flies May be Poisoned
Sometimes it seems impossible
to keep flies out of the house.
Even where the house is screened
a few flies will creep in occasion
ally. J. R. Watson, entomologist
to the University of Florida Ex
periment Station, suggests that
these flies be poisoned. The fol
lowing mixture will be found
helpful: formalin, 15 per cent,
milk, 25 per cent.; water 60 per
cent. Add a little sugar. A
piece of bread for the flies to light
on can be placed in the vessel con
taining the mixture.
Manure piles should be sprayed
with a mixture of 8 ounces sodi
um arsenite, 20 gallons of water
and one half pint of molasses
Borax is also recommended for
treating manure piles. Two-thirds
of a pound should be allowed for
each ten cubic feet or eight bush
els. It is used dry.
Manure piles are favorite
breeding places for flies and pre
cautions shOjMld be taken to kill
the larvae before they emerge. If
neighbors would cooperate in
treating manure and in destroy
ing filth, flies could be controlled
in any community.
In some sections of the state
cattle men are dipping all cattle
regardless of ownership. They
find that it is easier to dip them
than to cut them out. That would
be a good plan to follow in eradi
cating ticks from a county. Vats
could be built at intervals over
the county and it would not take
long to dip the entire cattle population.
One of the biggest cattle men
in the state made the statement
the other day that Florida would
be free of the cattle tick within
three years. He may or may not
be right, but it looks now as if
the tick's days were numbered.
Vats are certainly enjoying a
mushroom growth.

Potash in surprisingly large
proportions is present in the brin
es and muds of the Salduro Marsh
a sink in the Salt Lake Desert, a
bout 60 miles west. of the south
west edge of Great Salt Lake.
From the clays underlying the
salt body which covers the marsh
the U. S. Geological Survey col
lected samples at depths of 8 to
12 feet, in which the dissolved
salts were found to contain from
2 to about 3 1-2 per cent of potash
and 2 1-4 per cent was found in
the soluble salts at a depth of a
bout 4 feet. Of the dissolved
salts contained in the brines occu:
pying the spaces between the salt
crystals in the crust overlying
these muds 3 to 4 per cent, was
found to be potash.
Singularly enough the salt
crust left at the surface of the
desert through the evaporation
of the brines contains little nvVe
than a trace of potash, most Mf
the potash being confined to th
brines and to the muds underly
ing the salt crust. The success
ful extraction of this potash is a
fascinating as well as most press
ing problem for the chemical en
gineer. According to analyses
made by the Survey, the brines
and i muds from the Salduro
Marsh contain considerable mag
nesium chloride, as well as chlo
rides of potassium and sodium,
and so are somewhat similar in
composition to the deposits from
which potash is manufactured in
Germany. Therefore, it appears
that success in methods for manu
facturing potash at the Salduro
Marsh should prove comparative
ly easy. While no extensive ex
ploratory work has been done by
the Survey to show the area of
the deposit it is believed that the
amount of potash present in the
region, if it can be extracted with
commercial success, is sufficient to
provide a valuable source of sup
ply to the country.

Five hundred and nine Florida
girls made an average profit of
$67.58 from one-tenth of an arjrc,
cultivated by them in garden pro
duce last year. At this rate one
acre would produce $675. 80. Of
course' some of these girls made
considerably in excess of this a
mount, while others did not do so
well, but when we consider the
average made by this number of
girls, the results seem marvelous.

statewide campaign of informa
and education in cattle tick eradi
cation, and to bring to its aid
and assistance, as far as possible,
every organization and individual
in the state of Florida interested
in a bigger and better Florida.
The warm co-operation of the
federal department of agricul
ture, the state department of agri
culture, the state agricultural col
lege, the state board of health,
and the Florida Livestock associa
tion have already been assured,
and resolutions were recently a
dopted by the State Bankers' as
sociation at Daytona, and the
State Press association at Kissim
me( offering definite co-operation
in the proposed campaign
and characterizing it as the prin
cipal business issue before the
state.
The first concrete step in this
movement was the Florida Cattle
Conference held at Tampa on
February 7 and 8. This was de
signed to bring out as far as pos
sible the real conditions in Flori
da, whether advantageous or oth
erwise, with respect to the cattle
industry. Much of a useful and
interesting nature was disclosed
in this meeting, and it was shown
by speakers of experience and ex-
pert knowledge that until the
Texas fever cattle tick is entirely
eliminated from the state and the
federal quarantine restrictions re
moved the cattle business can
never reach that high state of de
velopment which is justified bv
the conditions of Florida soil and
climate.
Since the Tampa, conference
there have been a series of meet
ings in Jacksonville of represen-
tatives oi targe interests through
out the state, for the purpose of
discussing the method which
ought to be pursued to obtain the
most satisfactory results. The
earnestness of these discussions
has been striking, and as a result
a large fund has been placed, at
the disposal o'f the committee for
the purpose of prosecuting the
work.
Manager Sutherland is engag
ed in preparing a plan of cam
paign for submission to the execu
tive committee at its next meet
ing, which will be held earlv in
the month of May. It is the de
sire and intention of the commit
tee to seek all the advice possible
in the preparation of its plana.
and when these plans are finally
agreed upon to press the work
with the utmost vigor. The com
mittee has already been assured
by those in position to know that
the methods thus far followed in
completing its organization are,
by far the most effective and far-
reaching of anv movement, nf thn
kind heretofore undertaken if the '
quarantined area.
