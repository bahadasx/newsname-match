The great Charles Sumner is said
to have affected a picturesque style of
dress, wearing colors brighter than
those which predominated in the sen
atorial garb of the period. His appear
ance In hiB seat in the senate was
studiously dignified. He once re
marked to Noah Brooks that he never
allowed himself, even in the privacy
of his own chamber, to fall into a po
sition that !ic wouM not take in the
senate. "Habit is everything," he was
wont to say.

the city administration have each been
requested to attend the "Safely First"
meeting.at Walker's siding.on the Bal
timore and Ohio next Monday, May

as death-dealing paraphernalia which
is being used In the present catas
trophe In Europe. A wireless tele
gram station will accompany the train
of twelve cars and will receive and
send messages during it's stay here.
Its operation will be shown and ex
plained to the curious.
Torpedos which cost the United
States government, and other govern
ments as well, the neat sum of $8,
000 each will be shown, together with
exact models of immense battleship
guns. The "Vermont," Uncle Sam's
super-dreadnaught, will be exhibited
in models. The same is true of the
commercial raider "Columbia."
Besides the many objects of inter
est to put on display the government
will take up considerable time in ex
plaining the findings of the Bur/iu
of Mines. This will be one of the
vital studies for all Falrmonters Tor
over 60 per cent, of the populace here
is either directly or indirectly inter
ested in the Safety First work being
done by the local companies in this
section. Life saving canaries which
?^re used to detect chlorine gas will
be shown at their work. Oxygen
pumps, saifety lamps, barometers, gal
vonometera and other devV.es used in

It is boyoncMhe concoptton oMhoae
who have never taken any great
what is dime and hbw it is done each
time miners enter a mine for (he day's
work. There arc many laws on our
statute books providing for. tho care
and safety of miners but- these lafws
cannot bp enforced until tho miners
have been instructed in tho uses of
many sajfoty devices which devices
are being continuously replaced by
better and newer ones. The railroads
also come in for their supply of ex
hibits, displaying the many "Safety
First" appliances which are at present
in use on all railroads in America. De
vices which absolutely prevent eith
er head-on or rear collisons which are
in use on the electric roads entering
the larger cities, will be shown and
described in detail.
All persons within reach are in
vited to attend this free exhibit and
to see Just what is being done by the
government and large corporations in
the matter of taking care of their em

Fire Dangers.
Most everyono who has had any
dealings with machinery knows about
the liability of oily rags and waste
that have been used for cleaning pur
poses to ignite from spontaneous com
bustion; but few are aware that saw
dust, when soaked with oil drippihga,
will act in the same way. Sawdust is
sometimes seen scattered over garage
floors, but this practice should be
prohibited. Sand is the safest for ab
sorbing drippings.
Lines Hardly Appropriate,
The lines in the Dutch national
hymn, "Preserve, O God, the dear old
ground, thou to our fathers gave,"
seem to indicate a considerable mod
esty on the part of Netherlander, the
supposedly coirect fact being that they
reclalmnd the ground themselves.
Providence actually being something
of a hindrance, both to its acquisition
and Its "preservation" for which they
pray.
