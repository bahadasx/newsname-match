LETTER TO VOTERS.
Williamson lias Something to Say in
Reply to roclit's "How Much
Is Enongh r
This letter is inspired by the
outrageous mistatements appear
ing in an article in your paper
ast week entitled "How much is
enough?" The said article was
not written by a Huntingdon
County citizen, for he would
have known better than to make
such misstatements. It rants
about my being a bachelor, as if
that were a crime. Everyone in
luntingdon knows that I bor
rowed the money and built a lit
tle homo for my Mother, shortly
after the cleaty of my Father in
1)01, where she and I lived until
she was called Home in March
911. I therefore, have some
reason to know something of the
hi.?h cost of liv;ng. Here in
luntingdon it is public knowl
edge, through no fault of ours,
that my two brothers and I, by
means of our savings, paid the
sum of $11,187.23 of debts which
our Father left, we paying the
interest on the same at 4 per
cent. Ask Editor Butz, of the
Huntingdon Globe who was a
creditor of my father and was
paid the sum of $373 VS. This i.i
the sam'? Butz who is currently
reported to have p:tid a note of
$1000.00 in the First National
Bank of Huntingdon which Butz
had endorsed for Focht while
Jutz was Postmasterof Hunting
don. The Globe is supporting
Focht, perhaps expecting to get
the money back, or to again be
appointed Postmaster of Hunt
ingdon, although he has already
served 16 veai'3 a- Postmr.stf.'r of
Huntingdon, at a profit of over
$40.0(10.00.
I am not now filling any office
by appointment or election nor
have I been attorney for the
Huntingdon Reformatory since
October, 1915. The salary I re
ceived was trifling. It was for
professional services as a lawyer.
The fact that the Honorable
Member of the Board of Mana
gers of that Institution would
employ me as attorney is the
highest possible tribute to my
ability as a lawyer.
There are 435 members in Con
gress, 34 come from Pcnnsylva
nia. What a ridiculous compari-
son to argue that you keep your
tried and true family physician,
your pastor, or your (ble lawyer.
Of course you do. But if you
had 435 physicians, pastors, or
lawyers, would you not want fre
quently to replace some of them
with some new up-to-date phy
sicians, ministers, or lawyers?
Certainly you would. Are the
voters of the District to be in
suited with the preposterous state
ment that Mr. Focht is a States
man? I may not be much of an
improvement on him, but give
me a chance. I certainly can
measure up to his standard and
I hope to make a Representative
who will be a credit to this Dis
trict
I have made no pledge to any-
one or have I given any person
authority to pledge me in any
way. Elect me and not a Bank
in the District will be asked to
discount any of my paper nor
will I promote any get-rich-quick
or fake stock schemes. No man
ever lost as much as a postage
stamp through any dealings with
me. - '
I have always been a Republi
can and believe my nomination
will have a tendency to unite the
factions of the party.
Respectfully yours,
Richard W. Williamson.
Huntingdon, Pa.
May 6, 1916.
It wa3 impossible for George
A. Harris candidate for Congress
to make a canvass of hi3 home
County. Every person knows
him and as the district is so large
he was compelled to spend his
time in the other counties getting
acauainted with the voters. Let
us all boost a little and this nom
ination will come to Fulton.
J. C. Benedict, Waynesboro, Pa.,
For National Delegate.
The Herald. Waynesboro, re
cently stated th at the political lead
ers of the county, friendly to Gov
ernor Brumbaugh, had agreed
on John G. Benedict, secre
tary and treasurer of the Landis
Mch. Company, this city, a3 one
of the delegates from this Con
gressional district to the Rupub-
ican national convention at Chi
cago, June 7.
That Mr. Benedict is highly
qualified for the distinguished
ionor of representing the district
at the great party conclave, goes
without saying here, where he
resides and where he is so well
and favorably known. He has
all the prestige of an honored
name, a brilliant business record
and personal qualities that com
mend him to popular confidence,
support and esteem. He was
born and reared in the east side of
the county and has a large fami-
y connection that has always
been prominent in the county
citizenry. Since coming to Way
nesboro he haa had a brilliant
Ft t 1.1
career. He nas to a large extent
made the business of the Landis
Mch. Co. and brought it to the
front rank in our mott prosperous
industrios. His name will carry
and command respect in every
part of the congressional district.
No happier choice could have
been made on personal grounds.
Politically the election could
not bave been more adroit. Mr.
Benedict has never been a "fac
tion" man, -he has been just a
plain, modc'it, straight Republi
can without becoming involved
in the rancorous contentions of
the factions. Whilst naturally a
friend of the governor, his can
didacy should appeal just as
strongly to the partisans of Sen
ator Penrose, with whom he has
affiliated just as much as with
the Progressives.
There would seem to be no
reason in the world why the Re
publicans should not unite on
John G. Benedict and make this
election unanimous.
Since The Herald announced
Mr. Benedict's selection, expres
sions of the warmest approval
have been heard here from all
sides of the political household.

Pa. Iof. Reg't Reunion.
The Committee for arrange'
ments for the twenty sixth annu
al reunion of the 158th Penna In
fantry Regimental Association
has completed arrangements for
the next reunion to be held in
Chambersburg on Thursday, May
18th in Housum Post Hall No.
309. G. A. R. In the forenoon at
10 30 o'clock, a business session
will be held. In the afternoon

Welcome will be delivered by Ed
mund C. Wingerd, Esq., Burgess
of Chambersburg; Response by
Serg't S. D. Zeigler, of Newville,
Other addresses will be delivered
by the Rev." Henry W. Snyder,
pastor of Memorial ' Lutheran
Church, of Shippensburg, and
Norman L. Bonbrake, Esq., of
Chambersburg. Good music will
be rendered by the excellent
quartette composed of Miss Jessie
C.- Nead, Mrs. Charles B. Brand,
and Messrs. A. Vinton Vogel and
Elmer E. Martin. All old soldiers
and ladies of the Circle, and citi
zens are cordially invited to be
present.
It is the duty of every Demo
ccat to mark an X opposite the
name of George A. Harris for
Congress. He has conducted a
clean and dignified campaign as
ha3 been attested by the news
papers from all over the District.
If nominatqd he will command
the respect and support of a ma
jority of the voters of the district
at-the election.
John Pine residing in the Mead
owgrounds says he has a fine
healthy boil-of course, worth
five dollars that he will dispose
of at a reduced price of twenty
five cents,
I
BENJAMIN K. FOCHT
Your champion, your friend,
be you business man, teacher,
farmer or manufacturer, doctor,
dentist, soldier or soldier's wid
ow, mechanic, laborer, railroader
minor or fireman. He has enact
ed legislation for you all, and he
knows how because he is a busi
ness man trained in Legislative
practice. Of broad humanity
and a battler for justice and
equality, he has aided all modern
constructive legislation including
that for free school books, free
roads and free bridges, rural free
deli very, parcels post, ample pro
tective tariff and adequate pre
paredness, and better reward for
labor free from the menace of
competition with Europe and
Asia. You have seen him, you
have heard him before many au
diences. You Know Him, and
need him and his experience and
tested fidelity in Washington dur
ing these times when the strength
of the Nation is being weighed.
His work and his worth are not
in promises alone. You have
seen him courageously meet ev
ery trial squarely before the peo
ple, and in the darkest hour the
Republican party ever had, he
met every challenge in every
county and will do it again. Hav
ing shared the bitterness of par
ty defeat, now that the high
priests of free trade and a bun
gled " Democratic administration
are about to sound a retreat, Mr.
Focht asks that you let him share
with you the coming victory and
permit him to return to Washing
ton with a triumphant Republi
can party that will give the coun
try much needed and substantial
and sustained business prosperi
ty. He comes clean and a gen
tleman without a word of deroga
tion or otherwise concerning any
opponent. Having been ever
faithful to his trust and a dili
gent public servant, he asks to
win because he reflects your view
and your principles, and he offers
his public record as his best ad
vocate.
Vote for Benjamin K. Focht
for Congress at the Primary
Election, to be held Tuesday,
May 16, 1916.
Painful Accident.
Last Saturday Preston Croyle,
who was employed by the Breeze
wood Telephone Comyany to help
construct a branch in Licking
Creek township from the main
line at Harvey M. Strait's to D.
E. Mellott's. Howard Hann's and
Eagan's residence, fell from a
telephone pole 18 feet, to the
ground, fracturing the patella in
one of his legs, cutting an ugly
gash in his face, and bruising
himself up generally. Dr. Mos
ser was called and rendered nec
essary aid, but it will be some
time before he can shin up a
pole.
Jamea E. Lyon, of West Dub
lin, and Anderson Mellott, of
Needmore, went to Sunbury on
Monday to attend the United
States District Court as jurors.
As this is a busy time for farm
ers, they had no difficulty in be
ing excused from service and
they returned to their homes on
Tuesday. They were accompani
ed to Sunbury by Hon. Geo. B,
Mellott.

"The Birth of A Nation."
"The Birth of a Nation" is the
name of a moving picture show
that gave three exhibitions in
Chambersburg last week at $2
top price, with a total attend
ance of 2,523 people. It's a great
show, and cost a half-million dol
lars to produce. If you want to
see a real battle, see the men
life size in action, see the fire
and smoke of battle, hear the
patter of musketry, and the roar
of cannons, see the wounded and
dying and all the hellishness of
modern warfare, and at the same
time, have the sense of perfect
security from any harm to your
self, you want to see this great
exhibition. Among those who
went from this community were
Mr. and Mrs. Leslie W. Seylar,
Mr. and Mrs. H. U. Nace, Mr.
and Mrs. W. R. Sloan, Mr. and

Water Class Preserves Eggs.
It i3 during the spring of the
year when eggs are plentiful that
they should be put down"or'pre
served for winter use. Water
glass has been found to be the
best means of preservation.
Only fresh, clean eggs should
be used and they should never
be washed. Crocks, jars, and
galvanized iron or wooden vessels
may be used. Crocks, however,
are considered best. Any vessel
used should be clean and sweet
and wooden vessels should be
thoroughly scalded before eggs
are packed in them.
The liquid rather than the
powdered forms of water glass
is preferable. The home eco
nomics extension , department of
the Pennsylvania State College
School of Agriculture and Ex
periment Station recommends
using one part of the liquid wa
ter glass to ten parts of water.
It is advisable to boil the water.
When the solution has cooled the
eggs should be placed in it as
they are gathered and the vessel
containing eggs and solution
stored in a cool place. There
should always be one or two inch
es of solution above the eggs.
The solution made from one
quart of water glass will preserve
about twelve dozen eggs.

PRECAUTIONS AGAINST TYPHOID.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., Li. D.,
Commissioner of. Health.
Now that the vacation season
is approaching, when the town
folks will seek rest from their
daily toils, in tho realms of Na
ture, a word of warning against
indiscreet drinking of the waters
of the State.
While thousands of pollutions
have been removed from our
streams, it will take years to cor
rect the evils that have been
growing ever since our civiliza
tion began in this country. If
you desire to avoid typhoid fever
this coming season, co-operate
with those working to improve
health conditions. In your trav
els never depend upon the cele
brated town pump, the clearness
of a stream or the sparkling wa
ters offered by the wayside dwell
er to quench your thirst, unless
you know of the purity of the
water. Depend upon what you
carry with you, or if camping,
boil the water before using it for
domestic purposes. It is better
not to indulge in water cooled
with natural ice from an unknown
source. Do not clean your teeth
rinse your mouth or wash vege
table's or fruit to be eaten raw,
in unknown waters without first
boiling it for ten or fifteen min
utes. There are hundreds of deaths
and thousands of cases of ty
phoid fever in the United States
each summer and fall because of
failure to observe these precau
tions. If you send your family to a
summer resort without assuring
yourself of the purity and safety
of the water supply, you may be
risking their lives.
