El Paso. May 11. A reie-s was
taken at 1 oVIork ami ticmo-al Scott
announced the conf-fi-cnee "had made
progress and we may have something
to hay when we meet ajrain at 4
o'clock." General tJbrejron went to
lunch with a friend.
El Paso, May 11. General
Obregon called on Chief of Staff
Scott at 10 a. m. today for a
conference at which he was ex
pected to formally submit his
co-operative border patrol plan.
The meeting was held in Scott's
private car in the El Paso rail
way yards. Juan Amador, Under-Secretary
of foreign rela
tions, accompanied Obregon to
the meeting. ' ...
Obregon Has New Scheme.
War Minister Obregon is expected to
submit to General Scott in writing a
further proposal for a co-operative
border patrol involving withdrawal of
the American expedition from Mexico.
The plan is the last hope of the Car
ranzistau to gain their insistent de
mands, which to date deadlocked the
conference on international relations.
As the proposal involves a question on
which Oeneral Scott is powerless to
decide the expedition's withdrawal
there was a possibility of the entire
negotiations being switched to Wash
ington for adjustment by the state de
partment. .
Friction at Danger Point.
Despite the increased tension along
the border there was still a prospect of
peaceful settlement. Friction, how
ever, between the Mexican forces has
reached the danger point and officials
believe peace will be hard to maintain
unless a settlement is swiftly reached.
Oeneral Carranza is blocking a set
tlement of the plan to which Scott and
Obregon tentatively agreed on behalf
of their governments in the sec
ond conference. The succeeding meet
ings have found the Oarranzistas
on the ground with ew demands and
suggestions and one by one the con
tentions have been turned down with
out hesitation by Gfeneral Scott. Car
ranza, however, has ?ood pat through
out on his demand that a time limit
be set on the stay of the expedition in
Mexico and this point is presented in
new form in the joint border patrol
proposal.
Washington Marking Time.
Washington, May 11. Administra
tion officials today were hopeful that
Oeneral Obregon, Carranza war min
ister, would settle immediately the
agreement presented at Kl Paso by
General Scott and Funston, on behalf
of the United States. Despite the long
delay of Obregon it was pointed out
that General Scott had made no re
port indicating the agreement might
not be signed. Consequently officials
were not inclined to believe the nego
tiations would reach the point where
a break would occur between Mexico
and the United States.
General Obregon's informal propos
al for a Joint border patrol of Mexi
can and American troops, telegraphed
by General Scott apparently was not
considered seriously. It was said here
that President Wilson has indicated
no change in his former attitude that
the United States troops should re
main south of the border, until the
Carranza government can demon
strate beyond doubt its ability to pre
vent future bandit raids on American
border towns.
Sleep on Their Arms.
Columbus. N. M., May 11. Fears
expressed by some of the more credu
lous residents of Columbus were al
layed today by Major W. R. Sample,
base commander, who assured the
towns people that the defensive meas
ures being taken here by the troops
are merely precautionary. Despite
these assurances however, a few of the
citizens left town.
A company of infantry continued to
sleep on their arms last night that
they might be prepared for action If
trouble should develop. Construction
of trenches and earth works about the
camp continued today. These all are
being dug at some distance beyond
the camp lines.
Kverything was in readiness for the
arrival of the New Mexico national
guard 1,200 strong, some of the com
panies of which are expected tonight
or tomorrow.
It's Up to Obregon.
El Paso. May 11. Upon General
Obregon depends today the outcome
of the negotiations begun between him
and Generals Soott and Funston some

If . Oil Is Found at OverbrooR,
Booh Is On.
Leases on Six Thousand Acres
of Land Sear Topeka.
IF NOT OILJHEN FIND GAS
Senator Overfield Tells of Con
ditions in Shawnee.
Cudahy Oil and Refining Com
pany Ready to Purchase.
Should oil be discovered at Over
brook, the Cudahy Oil and Refining
company, now a part of the big Sin
clair syndicate, will close options on
6,000 acres of land held in this vicin
ity and obtain oil leases. Following
the securing of these leases oil drill
ing on an extensive scale will begin
at once.
Senator J. L. Overfield of Independ
ence, producing representative of the
Cudahy concern, admitted that much
today at the National hotel. A care
ful study of geological conditions in
this section has been made and Is
leading oil men to believe the territory
surrounding Topeka will become a
productive field, Senator Overfield de
clared. Gas At Least,
"If oil is not discovered," said Sen
ator Overfield, "I am quite certain
they will find gas."
Sweeping changes in the operation
of oil concerns as a result of the Sin
clair merger, were predicted by Sena
tor Overfield. Like all others in the
oil business Senator Overfield is un
certain as to the future course of op
eration of the gigantic syndicate.
Yet. from advices already received
he believes many important transfor
mations in the management of the oil
and gas business will be noted in a
short time. W. H. Isom of Chicago,
representing the refining interests of
the Cudahys, and Senator Overfield,
representing the producing interests,
will remain actively in the oil busi
ness in Kansas and Oklahoma that
much is certain, the senator stated.
Whether Senator Overfield will re
main in politics, or not, depends large
ly upon the final word received from
New York regarding his activities in
the future.

Dutch Anti-War Council Starts
Peace Proposal.
Solicits Aid of U. S. Organiza

New York, May 11. In response to
an appeal from, the Netherlands anti
war council, a meeting at which will
be considered a proposal that Presi
dent Wilson be urged to promote a
conference of neutral nations, at a
date to be named, to offer mediation
in the European war, will be called
soon in this country. This was an
nounced today by Hamilton Holt,
chairman of the American branch of
the central organization for durable
peace, the recipient of the appeal.
The appeal of the Dutch council, ac
cording to Holt, indicates belief by
many persons in the Netherlands that
Emperor William, through Germany's
reply to the American note in the
submarine controversy, made an in
direct bid -for peace. Mr. Holt said 1
that no definite plana had been out
lined except that the purpose of the
meeting would be to analyze the ap
peal and set in motion whatever forces
it might hope to direct toward peace.
Hope for World Peace.
The Dutch communication after
pointing out that the Dutch govern
ment and Switzerland are strong for
equal action and that "recent speeches
of Bethmann-Hollweg and Asquith
open possibility of conciliation," says:
"The Dutch committee hopes you
will deem possible co-operation of
American peace organizations, and
eventually the Mohonk conference in
urging President Wilson to promote a
conference of neutrals' to offer media
tion for durable peace and an interna
tional system which will secure the
principle of equal rights for all civil
ized states as Asquith has described
the purpose of the allies-."
