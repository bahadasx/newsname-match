of Texas, and taking in three little
settlements near the border Glenn
Springs, Boqulllas and Deemers took
place on Friday night and Saturday
morning, but news of It did not reach
here until Sunday.
Within an hour preparations had
been made for adequate action. Major
General Funston ordered that in all
four troops of cavalry should proceed
to the raided section to reinforce small
detachments already on the scene from
Presidio and other convenient points.
These troops got under way at once,
It was said here that if the exigency
or the case demands sucb action they
will cross the border In order to run
down and disperse the bandits.
In a little adobe house nine cavalry
men made their fight for life against
the 70 or more Villista bandits at
Glenn Springs. A hail of shot poured
for more than two hours Into the
single window of the mud adobe, but
the Americans refused to give up,
The cavalrymen kept up a steady rifle
fire In defiant answer. Then the Mex
ican leader ordered Are balls to be
thrown on the roof, thickly thatched
with candelaria.
The blazing weed tortured the sol'
diers below and burnt their heads and
bodies. Then, smashing the door, the
troopers broke for the open, firing
they ran. Two were shot and killed
as they fled. One is missing and it is
believed 'he is dead. Another was
kijlod as he tried to , climb through a
window.
According to the story brought here.
the Mexican bandits first attacked a
tore and one or two houses in Bo
qulllas, where they made Deemcr and
Compton prisoners, and then sped 15
miles northward to make their attack
on Glenn Springs, which Is fringed by
rugged hills. At Glenn Springs they
wrecked a wax factory belonging to

BERLIN'S CHARGE Of DISCRIMINATION
TO BE DENIED BY PRESIDENT WILSON
Washington, D. C. Study of the
German submarine note is convincing
President Wilson's advisers that an
other reply must be made in order to
answer certain charges against the
United States made in that document
These charges are :
First That the United States had
discriminated against Germany and in
favor of Great Britain in its demands
that international law be obeyed.
Second That the United States
would have brought freedom of the
seas bad it insisted on its rignts
against Great Britain.
Third That he United States has
aided Germany's enemies by supply
ing them with all kinds of war mater
ials.
The President and his advisers de
clare there has been no discrimination
for or against any belligerent since the
war began.
To bring about the adoption of a
submarine policy based on the recog
nized basis of international law, it was
necessary for the United States to con
duct negotiationa with Germany which
have extended over a period of 13
months. For IB months the United
States has been negotiating with Great
Britain and her allies to put a stop to
violations of international law leveled
against neutral commerce.
Mr. Wilson holds, his advisers de
clare, that it was far more important
obtain protection for human life
than it was to arrange for protection
for dollars, and it was for this reason
that he proceeded with such vigor
gainst Germany. Attention is called
the representations and protests
which have been made to Great Bri
tain and France as proof of the effort
of the administration to prevent the
seizure of innocent goods by ships of
the allied powers.
If Germany will give the government
here a chance, it is declared, Germany
will have no reason to complain of the
lack of vigor of the President
ondon Rejects All Peace Talk;
Allies Willing to Wait Better Time
London The London morning news
papers Monday laid great emphasis on
Germany's alleged desire for peace.
If President Wilson accepts the
German note as a basis for further dis
cussion," says tne Daily cnronicie,
his motive must be sought not in the
terr.is which Germany offers, but in
the wider suggestion which was ex-

pressed by only a hint in the document
but was presumably amplified in verbal
communications with the American
ambassador. Germany now is at the
top of her military achievement If
she can make peace now it would be on
terms more favorable than later. If
she can strongly enlist American pub
lic opinion that is a great step toward
the accomplishment of this object
" "In such a situation the allies' cause
needs a plain declaration by the allied
statement that no peace negotiations
are admissible at the present stage.
Public opinion in the allied and neutral
countries needs to be clearly reminded
of the essential issues underlying the
present struggle."

Holding of Oats Raises Price.
Not enough oats are offered to keep
up with the present demand and the
holding back of supplies is slowly but
surely forcing up prices. There is a
difference of opinion in the trade as
to the quantity of oats remaining in
the country, some dealers declaring
that stocks have been reduced to a
point much below expectations, while
others assert that the unsold supply
is heavy and that the carry-over into
the new crop will be of record size. ,
Whichever side is right there is no
question as to the bullishness of hold
ers, and their refusal to sell has
brought about a stronger market For
prompt delivery, $26.25 was offered at
the - Merchants' exchange yesterday
and $26.75 was asked. The same price
was bid for June oats and $27.60 was
asked. On the Sound, the demand for
oats was stronger than here. A part
of the strength of the market Is cred
ited to the pending government order.
The barley market derives much of
its strength from California, where
continued dry, warm weather is each
day lessening the chance of a good
crop. '
Raise Tanbark in Northwest.
Efforts are to be made through the

of commerce, agricultural college and
John Hall, special representatives of
the New Zealand Dominion govern
ment in Portland, to develop the culti

tanning purposes.
The Australian government is con
ducting a systematic campaign to fos
ter the growing of wattle in New
South Wales, because of the scarcity
of suitable tan barks. Mr. Hall calls
attention to the similarity of the clim
ate in New South Wales to that of
Oregon and believes the culture of
wattle can be made profitable In this
state.
