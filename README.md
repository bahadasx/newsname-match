A tool for finding name frequency in unstructured text

About
-----

This project is part of the District Data Research Labs on Entity Resolution

Data
----

This dataset contains OCR text extracted from the front page of newspapers in 1961.  It has been gathered from http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov

Goal
----

One of the problems with this dataset is that there is no way to currently rank them according to the frequency in which a particular candidate's name appears within each front page of a particular newspaper.

The goal of this project is to provide a method in which to identify the occurrence of these candidates within a particular newspaper from a particular date, as well as how frequently these names appear.
