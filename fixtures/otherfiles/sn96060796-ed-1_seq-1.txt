ACCOUNT BECAUSE
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The Tom Reed mine has been
one of the most persistent pro
ducers of gold in the state, hav
ing sent to the mint every year
during the past four years more
than $1,000,000, from which div
idends aggregating better than
6 J per cent yearly were paid to
the shareholders.
At the late Arizona state fair
Coconino county won a small
prize that is worth making a big
noise about first on a sheaf of
alfalfa. This was against the
competition of Yavapai which
won first on general county ex
hibit, and of Maricopa, which is
supposed to have the others so
far out classed she is not allow
ed to compete for the county
cup. Coconino also got a big
fist full of blue ribbons on other
things, but up to this time has
never been touted as an alfalfa
section.
The Plomosa district, lying
east of the Colorado river be
tween the Plomosa mountains
and the Castle Dome range in
Yuma county, contains large
beds of gold hearing gravel,
which has been quite thorough
ly tested. Very complete in
vestigations have been made on
these beds, and samples gave
an average run of 64 cents per
cubic yard. Nuggets have been
found running to $25. This dis
trict covers an area of approxim
ately 7,500 acres, and in 1912
produced almost $10,000 by pan
ning after rainfall.
It is reported that Colorado
mining men are making an in
vestigation of the Old Peck mine
in the Bradshaws, with the
object of finding out the tung
sten values which have been re
ported to be good. What the
outcome will be is of course pro
blematical, but at any rate it is
quite probable that if upper
workings justify it, the lower
levels will be pumped and ex
aminations will be made. Sev
eral old timers of the district
maintain that this famous old
bonanza, like the Tip Top, has
good values in tungsten.
It is now generally conceeded
that mining is firmly establish
ed upon a legitimate basis, and
that the industry is as safe
as any other investment and
much safer than many. This
recognition is certainly gratify
ing and it is pleasing to note
that when success crowns any
mining venture that the profits
are often a thousand times great
er than that accompanying a re
alization from any other legitim
ate occupation or pursuit; ex
cepting, possibly, in times of
war, when certain lines enjoy a
rather spasmodic season of pros
perity. In 1914, owing to the depres
sion preceding the great war,
the production of copper in Ari
zona fell from mote than 200,
000,000 pounds to 158,000,000,
and many of the mines curtailed
production and the little fellows
went out of commission. Late
in 1914 the mines began to re
vive and by May of this year
the larger properties were up to
normal and since that time have
made a record production. The
estimate for the United States
for 1915 is 1,600,000,000 pounds
of copper, a record production,
with Arizona at the head of the
list with over 300,000,000.
Kingman postoffice has been
one of the busiest places in the
county the past few weeks.
Great truckloads of mail are now
being taken from and sent to
trains at all times of the day.
The office, which a few months
ago was considered adequate for
all needs of the town, is now too
small to accommodate the chang
ed conditions. The postmastei
has been getting the mail mov
ing all the time, although 10,000
to 30,000 pieces of mail are
dumped into the office at a time.
These have to be either cancell
ed or counted, which requires a
large amount of work. Nearly
a carload of mail has been dump
ed into the waiting room of the
postoffice, while the assorting
room contains as much more.
And this a daily occurrence.
Mohave County Miner.
As a constant increase in con
struction operations in the Paci
fic Coast region, there has been
a gradual advance in the price
of building material.
Reports from Seattle state
that lumber and shingles have
moved upwards in price during
the past few days. Fir lumber
is now selling at from $1 to $3
per thousand higher than sixty
days ago.
Conditions in the market are
reported to be better than for
two years. Drop siding, quoted
a short time ago at $13 to $13.50
per thousand feet, is in demand
at $16 and up. An advance of
$1 per thousand has been made
on all lines shipped from Wash
ington and Oregon coast-wise
to California points.
Logs are reported very scarce
at Puget Sound mills. There is
a limited supply of number 1 logs
and Puget Sound mills nave
about quit selling to brokers and
middlemen. Los Angeles Examiner.
Option Taken on Blue Lead Mine.
Chas. N. Hoffman, a mining
engineer representing the Lone
Star Mining and Development
company, a Texas corporation,
this week closed an option for
the Blue Lead mine in Wright
son district, the property of the
Washington Trading company
of Patagonia, says the Santa
Patagonian. The Blue Lead is
located about six miles north
west of town, and has produced
considerable lead-silver ore. For
the past several months the
property has baen idle.
Mr. Hoffman is to start work
at once and development is to be
continued from the three tunnels
which have been run on the
claims. At first the force will
not be large, but according to
the terms of the option, a good
sized crew will have to be added
as the work progresses.
With the present prices of
metals the Blue Lead should
-prove a winner to its new own
ers, as there is no question of
the ore bodies. Formerly the
property was a regular producer
when silver and lead were not
quoted at anything like present
figures. When lead went down
to a little over 3 cents and silver
was in the 40's the mine was un
able to pay much above the cost
of operation, but with lead sell
ing at $5.40 and silver at 55 cents
an ounce and Blue Lead will be
a valuable addition to Patago
nia's list of shippers.

The ore from the Buffalo carries
a good per cent of silver values.

doing some development on a
large scale. .

prices. The ore gets better as
depth is secured.
Jake Johnson came in this

put the Dixie in the shipping
class within a short time.
Mike Hannon, the well known

Harvey P. Greene, who has
edited The Patagonian for the
past year, left Friday of last
week via Nogales for Phoenix,
where he will pass the winter.
Mr. Greene is a newspaper man
of wide experience. He made
many friends both for himself

knows how much, Prescott is to
have a court house to cost more

tlake is to have electric lights,
the United States army is spend
ing the winter at Nogales and
Douglas, and for the first time

deficit. Williams is planning,
bigger waterworks and a sanit
ary sewer, and a Flagstaff man
will build a road next summer to
the top of the San Francisco
peaks, the highest toe-hold in
the state. A Flagstaff bank is
almost doubling its capital stock
and both banks are preparing to
open branches in Oatman, where
one is now doing business and
the fourth has been chartered.
Mohave county has Oatman it
self, which as a gold camp pro
mises to rival Nevada's best.
Before these words get into type
it is probable Coconino county
will move for a good roads bond
issue of $200,000. People say
the Magma mine in Pinal county
to which a railroad was recently
built, will be the biggest single
mine in the world and the steel
rails are reaching out to Ajo
camp in Pima county, which
hopes to go it one better. Bis
bee mines are humming full
time, Tombstone is being re
juvenated and everything is go
ing smoothly at the Mascot mine.
Graham county's fertile fields
are attracting attention and a
big mining venture has just been
launched with a Phoenix man at
its h&ad. Globe is working over
the court house, Miami is boom
ing and the oil men are just
about to bring in the gushers at
Roosevelt. Ray and Jerome are
too busy to talk making copper.
Payment for Parker lots has
been extended another year
pending the opening of the ad
jacent Indian reservation, and
payments on the Salt River re
clamation project have been de
ferred a year. The Navajo red
skins are making blankets and

making garden and building
school houses. Hay in the Salt
River valley is selling for $12 a
ton and deposits in the banks of
Arizona are eight or ten millions
in excess of this time one year
ago. Thanksgiving is past but
there is no legal restriction
against acknowledging gratitude
at Christmas. Arizona.
This week there have been
great doings at the porphyry
copper mines of the Copperfield
Porphyry, the tunnel having
been driven about fifteen feet in
to the richest ore ever found in
the vein. The whole breast of.
ore is said to run 25 per cent.
Large chunks of pure copper
show throughout the mass, while
the run of glance ore is much
greater than toward the portal.
