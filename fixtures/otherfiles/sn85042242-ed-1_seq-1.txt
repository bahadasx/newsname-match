Approximate increases for leading
manufacturers iu 1915 were given as
$6,773,039 for iron, steel and heavy

beet1, malt, tonics and liquors were
$'3,674,770 less iu 1915 and in 1911.
Assaults of prohibitionists, increased
rail rates, the federal emergency war
ax, au unusually cool summer and
business depression in the first pari,

Washington, Dec. 31.—Oilicial gov­

crude petroleum during the last year
was greater than in 1914, although
"production was purposedly retarded
sis far as practicable that reserve
stocks of crude petroleum now being
held in the country are the largest
ever recorded, and that exports of
gasoline to which the rise iu prices
frequently has been attributed were
in the last ten months of 1915 less
than the exports during the corres­

starting from in. unknown source at
5:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon caus­
ed a loss of :ibout $50,00•'),1HJ aud
threatened for a time, lo wipe the
town off 'the map.
The lire started iu the Uosendahl
and Nyhaken hardware store located
in the spledid brick block recently
erected, and spread rapidly to the
postofiice and the John Thompson
genera! merchandise store, all of
which were in the same building.
The loss 1o the Rosendahl & Ny­
haken company is estimated to be
around *12,000 and the loss to the
Thompson grocery store is climated
at $10,000.
The brick building was owned
jointly by Thompson and Nyhaken
and cost $!),000, covered by $4.0W in­
surance.
The fire spread so rapidly that it
was impossible to save any of the
mail from the postofflce, and as a re­
sult the damage there was consider­
able. no correct estimate being pos­
sible.
An old frame building, the first
ever erected in Dunn Center, and for­
merly used by Rosendahl & Nyhaken
as ?. hardware store, was also com­
pletely destroyed by the fire. This
building was at the rear of the new
hardware store and was filled with
farm machinery. The total loss to
fhis building and stock is estimated
at $4,000.
The volunteer tir^ department aug­
mented by practically all of the r\
in town worked like mad and in the
face of inadequate equipment and
cold and a high wind accomplished
the seemingly impossible by prevent­
ing the spread of the fire

The Holt pool hall, only fourteen
feet from the burning brick bloc
was saved, but, was badly scortched.

AUSTRIA'S REPLY TO
AMERICAN NOTE
Vienna, via London, Dec. 31.—The
Austrian government had delivered
to American Ambassador Penfield its
reply to the second United States
no'.e on the sinking of the Italian
.steamer Ancona by an Austrian sub­
marine.
The note discloses that the sub­
marine commander has been punished.
The Vienna government "agrees thor­
oughly with the American cabinet
that the sacred commandment of hu­
manity must be observed also in
war," and private ships not sunk
without persons aboard being brought
to safety unless vessels flee or offer
resistence. The indemnification of
Americans for losses sustained in the
disaster is the chief point at issue."
Meets American Demands.
Washington, Dec. 31.—Austria's re­
ply to the Ancona note not only
meets the cardinal points of the
American demand but gives assur
p^fes for the future, which are con­
sidered more satisfactory in their ex­
tent than those which were given by
Germany.
The full American official view will
not be known until after President
Wilson has studied the Austrian re­
ply which was received today from
Ambassador Penfield, and -was im­
mediately dispatched to Hot Springs,
Va., bv a White House messenger. It
may be' stated authoritatively, never­
theless that danger of a rupture of

British Claim.
London, Dec. 31.—•
According to of­
ficial information supplied to tho Ab~
sociated Press, the British govern­
ment takes the stand thai any par­
cels sent by mail, no matter what
class of postage is paid on them, aro
liable to seizure, if they contain
goods, which under the orders in,
council, may not be shipped to or
from Germany or her allies.
First class, actual postal corres­
pondence, according to this stand, i»
inviolable on vessels stopped on the
high sea's and is only subject to Brit­
ish municipal law when carried on
ships which voluntarily call at those
ports.
May Censor Letters.
Mai'l on ships calling at British
ports, however, will be subject to
municipal law, which means that un­
der the present war conditions the
government reserves the right to ex­
tend the censorship to such mail.
(ireat Britain takes her stand on'
the Hague convention of 1907, which
according to the British contention,
gives no protection to parcels, no
matter under what class of postage
they may be carried. The resolution
passed at that convention, printed in
French, explicitly states that the onjly
form of mail not liaDle to seizure is
"correspondence postal."
Official circles here give assurance
to neutral powers that letters p^st
found on vessels seized or searched
on thefhigh seas will not be disturbed
unless it is directed to a belligerent
power* which i? nndf*r «rtnal biock^i
