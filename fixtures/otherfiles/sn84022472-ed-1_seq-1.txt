London, Jan. 1 The Amsterdam
correspondent of Reuter's Telegram
Ca. says that. Emperor William, ac
cording to a despatch from Berlin, has
sent the following New Tear's mess
age to the army, navy and colonial
troops.
"Comrades: another year of severe
fighting has elapsed. Wherever a su
perior number of enemies has stormed
our lines they have failed before your
loyalty and bravery. Wherever I
have sent you into battle you have
gained a glorious victory. Thankful,
we remember today, . , above all, our
brethren who Joyfully gave their blood
in-order to gain security for our be
loved at - home and imperishable glory
for the fatherland. What they have
begun, we shall accomplish with God's
gracious help.
"In impotent madness enemies from
the west and east, from the north and
south, still seek to deprive us of all
that makes life worth living. . JThey
long ago buried the . hope to conquer
us 4ni honest-fighting... On fche weight
of . their, masses; on the starvation of
our entire people, on the influence of
their campaign of caluminatlon, which
Is as mischievous as it is malicious,
they Ibelieve they - can still reckon.
Their plans will not succeed.
- "Before the spirit of determination
which imperturbably unites the army
and those at home their hopes will be
miserably disappointed. With : a will
to discharge the duty to the father
land to the last breath and determina
tion to secure victory, we enter, the
new year with God for the protection

.v ' s y
Rome, Jan. 1. The annual New
Tear's ceremony of the presentation
of the greetings to the King by the
cabinet ministers, senators, deputies
and high state officials - is occurring
at the war front this year instead of
in the Quierinal palace .at Home! This
is i the greatest change noticeable- in
the capital and it adds to the popu
larity of the sovereign who, since the
warv began, irrespective of the great
heat in the Isonzo In July and August
or of the extreme cold at this season
on the crests of the ' Alps, 10,000 feet
high, has refused to leave his soldiers
even for a day. ' . -
Rome has virtually the same, gay as

ticeable difference Is the larger num
ber of men wearing military uniforms.
All amusements are proceeding as in
past years. '

BASCULE DESIGN
IS PLANNED FOR
DRAW J)F BRIDGE
East Washington Avenue
Structure Will Be of Mod
ern Lift Type.
OBVIATES TROUBLE
IN SHIFTING SANDS
Grand Street Crossing Will
Be Ready Before Work
Starts on Other.
Instead of the present style of
swinging bridge on a central pier the
proposed new East Washington ave
nue bridge will have one draw open
ing of the bascule lift type operated
from the west pier of the bridge. This
design has been decided on so that
nomore trouble may be experienced
from the shifting quicksands and mud
that have disturbed the foundations
of the central pier of the present
bridge and caused It to be unsafe for
trolley car travel. )
The new bridge will be designed for
trolley car travel of the heavier type
of street cars, which were not in use
when , the present bridge was built.
In fact, It was not thought that 'street
car traffic would go( that way at all,
when the bridge was built, more than
3 0" years ago.
Designs and plans of both the East
Washington avenue and the Grand
street bridge may be seen at the city
engineer's office in city hall. A public
hearing for the approval of the plans
for both bridges will be held in the
common council chamber of the city
hall at ,2; 30 on the afternoon of Jan.
10. The arrangements were ordered
by MaJ. George B. Pillsbury, Corps of
Engineers, TJ. S. A. The latter, how-
er, ' has Been transrerrea to a new
post and hi3 successor will conduct
the hearing.
The East Washington-avenue bridge
will occupy substantially the site of
the present bridge . IjutE. will be about
10 feet wider. It will nave only one
draw opening with a bascule lift. The
east fender of the new : bridge draw
will be on the same line'.- as the east
fender of they present west draw open
ing. The west fender will- he about
1 0 feet west of the present west fender'
of this opening. The new draw will
have a 70 foot horizontal clearance
Between renders, as compared wixn
60 feet in the present bridge. ,-
. The proposed bridge at Grand street
will have a draw span with a 70-foot
clearance -between fenders, measured
at right angles to the channel line.
The draw will be centrally located
with respect to the channel, which is
straight in this locality. The draw
will be a double-leaf bascule lift.
This bridge will not be destined for
street car traffic. vWork will begin
as soon as the plans are approved and
the, contracts , awarded. The new
Stratford avenue bridge ' and the
Grand street bridge will be completed
before) work is started on the proposed
East Washington avenue bridge.
No street widening is contemplated
at the approaches to the East Wash
ington avenue bridge, which will cost
$130,000.
Bonds of $200,000 were voted for
the Grand street bridge and the streets
and sidewalk committee of theNjon)
mon council is asking for $50,000 ad-
ditonal for land ' damages for , widen
ing on the Grand street side of the
bridge. . The span- will cross the l'e-
quonnock, the eastern- approacn to d
at Arctic street.' ' .
