AUSTRIA BELIEVED YIELDING
Sincere Desire to Preserve Friendly
Relations May Cause Dual Mon
archy to Sacrifice Much In
Her Next Reply.
Washington. An Impasse, In tho
opinion of officials here, may soou
be reached In tho negotiations be
tween the United States and Austria
Hungary over the Ancona affair, If
tho dual monarchy, as reported In
press dispatch, Is to aBk that tho Is
sues be submitted lo nn International
court of arbitration.
President Wilson refused In all of
tho German submarine cases to arbi
trate questions Involving the ruthless
destruction of American lives. He has
consented to arbitrate only matters of
Indemnity. It is not believed here that
ho will yield more to Austria-Hungary
In this regard than he did to Germany.
According to dispatches from Vien
na, Baron Zwledlnek, the Austrian
charge d'affaires here, last week,
sought to learn from Secretary of
State Lansing how tho administration
would regard an arbitration proposal.
Secretary LniiBlng Is said to have
told the Austrian diplomat that this
government could not consent to ar
bitrate the primary Issues. To do bo.
It Is assorted hero, would be to admit
that there might bo some doubt ns to
the right of a submarine commander
to fire upon an unresisting merchant
ship carrying American passengers.
Austria can appeal to arbitration
with greater proprlely than did Ger
many in the submarine controversy
last summer, for there Is a convention
of arbitration between tho United
States and that country, wiilch was
concluded In 1909.
Austria May Yield.
Berlin. From a highly competent
non-Austrian source in Vienna, pri
vate advices have been received by
a press agency, taking an optimistic
view ot tho Austro-Ameilcart slida
tlon. The Austrian government, it Is de
clared, appears to bo actuated by a
sincere desire to preserve friendly
relations with tho United States,
even at a considerable sacrifice, nnd
In endeavoring to formulate a reply
to tho second American note on 'he
Ancona which the United Stales may
deem satisfactory.

MILLION FOR ROADS
Clay County Comes Out in Fa
vor of Complete System of
Rock Highways.
NO OPPOSITION IN COMMITTEE
County Court Petitioned to Have Sur
vey Made by Federal Engineer
A Graduated Tax,
Clay county ratnA oit In no uncer
tain terras the othff- d u In favor of
a system of rock road that, will put
every farmer In Its boundaries within
at least three mlleq of a 365-day high
way. The executive road committee, com
posed of two men from every town
ship In the county, was practically a
unit In deciding to ask tho county
court to call a bond election and give
tho voters a chance to Indorso tho
plan for building 180 miles of rock
roads. Such opposition ns developed
was due to the fear of representatives
of sorao districts that the proposed
roads would not reach their territory,
nnd it was emphasized that any rock
road plan that could bo dovised and be
fair to all would be supported in all
sections of the county.
The committee mot in the sheriff's
office at tho courthouse while the coun
ty court was meeting In the courtroom
across the hall. The court was peti
tioned to ask a federal engineer to
come to Clay county and, with tho
county surveyor, to go over tho roads
finally selected to bo rocked and to
estimate tho cost. It Is now figured
the roads can bo built for about $6,000
a mile, which would make tho bond
issue to be asked about $1,080,000. Ono
hundred interested citizens met with
the committee.
Petitions from every township, each
bearing two hundred names of prop
erty owners favoring the improvement,
were handed In at the meeting and
turned over to tho county court. This
body is composed of Judge H. D. Mil
ler, presiding, and Judge J. B. Walker
and Judge J. D. Mlnter, all road en
thusiasts. So that it Is oxpected tho
rock road program will go through
without a hitch oven though a two
thirds majority voto Is necessary to
cany tho bonds.

COUNTY ROAD BONDS LEGAL
Rocked Highways Insured at Many
Points by Recent Ruling of the
Attorney General.
An opinion has been given by the at
torney general's office that Missouri
counties with township road organiza
tions have the constitutional power to
Issue county bonds to be used In build
ing rock roads.
Fifteen counties in the state have
township organizations: Cass, Barton,
Bates, Caldwell, Carroll, Charlton, De
Kalb, Dent, Henry, Linn, Livingston,
Mercer, Nodaway, Sullivan nnd -Vernon.
Rock road boosters in these
counties, several of which aro discuss
ing tho adoption of the county-wide
system of rock road building, had be
lieved tho township organization would
he a bar in tho way of voting county
road bonds. The opinion given by tho
attorney general's office, which fol
lows, removes that doubt;
Under tho provisions ot section 12,
artlclo 10, of the stato constitution,
any county, city, - town or township,
school district or other political sub
division of tho stato may becomo In
debted to an amount not exceeding 5
per cent ot the taxable wealth of such
political subdivision, to bo ascertained
by tho assessment next before the last
assessment for state and county pur
poses previous to tho Incurring ot such
Indebtedness. Thero Is tho proviso,
however, in this section of tho consti
tution that with the assent of two
thirds of he voters of the county voting
at the election, any county may bo nl
lowed to becomo indebted to a larger
amount for the erection of n court
houso or Jail, or for the grading, con
structing of paved, graveled, macada
mized or rock roads and necessary
bridges and culverts thoreln.

Cannon Still Poses as Treasury
Watchdog.
With the Administration, of Course,
In the Matter of the Country'o
Preparedness, Only There la a
String to His Vote..
The Old Guard is mostly all gone,
but It would bo a pity to forget what
was at all events a plcturesquo group.
Of them nil, who wall more plcturesquo
than Uncle Joo? But ho was moro
than picturesque, and his first Inter
view upon his return to Washington
for'hls-tNvcirtlctS oonxriET ebows him
still tho watchdog of tho treasury,
with a penchant for apt quotations.
While presidents and ex-presldents are
citing Scrlpturo tho speaker displays
his versatility by turning to Tacitus
for nn observation that is right to the
point: "The peace of nations cannot
be secured without arms, nor arms
without pay, nor pay without taxes,"
How fortunate that tho economy-loving
Democrats (when the Republicans
are In) havo lo lay tho taxes for pre
paredness! Uncle Joo has a note ot
commiseration In his voice as ho con
templates their difficulties. His voto
Is at tholr disposal patriotism bo
fore partisanship for Danville only
there is the distressing disagreement
between McAdoo and Kltchln aB to
tho condition of tho treasury, which
Is qulto beyond his powers of com
posing. Thero was a tlmo, to be sure,
when congress voted $50,000,000 for
defense In a lump, and the treasury
stood tt without a quiver, but that
was long ago. McKlnloy was In the
Whlto House, nnd McKlnley was a
Republican, wasn't he? That ex
plains a lot.
PROSPERITY AFTER THE WAR
Country's Interests Will Be Safe
guarded With a Democratic Ad
ministration In Power.
Tho Republican party will find It
difficult to creato any special dissat
isfaction with the Democratic tariff
law. It has not encouraged such a
volume ot Imports as could possibly
affect tho American manufacturer
and laborer, and thero Is no prospect
of any flood of Imports from Europe
such as tho campaign prophets are
predicting. For some tlmo after peace
Europo will have to feel Its way. It
will have to count Us money, cstimnto
Its debts, take note ot its remaining
available energy and survey tho area
of ruin that It will havo to rebuild
through years of toll and sorrow.
There will bo homo problems for
Immediate consideration too complex
and vital to cnablo It to pitch In to
flood the markets ot the world with
pauper-made products.
Tho primacy ot tho United States
after tho war will not bo hard to
maintain If tho people will only keep
their heads. And retaining in power
the present administration will to the
first and most essential manifestation
of the ability to keop their heads.
Houston Post.
Safer In Democratic Hands.
The Monroe doctrine Is safe bo long
ns wo havo a Democratic administra
tion. That has been tested. It had
almost lapsed Into Innocuous desue
tude nt least In the public thought
until It was vigorously reasserted
by the first Democratic president
elected and seated sinco tho Civil war
Grover Cloveland. It remained to
Woodrow Wilson to emphasize tho
doctrine In its largest and most po
tent reaches In his third nnnual ad
dress to congress. Doubtless It would
bo safe under Republican administra
tion, but In view of tho fact that It
has found Its chief support and em
phasis under Democratic presidents,
tho country feels that tho doctrlno Is
safer when foreign complications
arise It a Democrat Is In tho White
House.
Lo, the Poor Steel Trust.
Tho steel trust has unfilled orders
for 7.1S9.4S9 tons of metal. This Is
an Increase In ndvanco orders of 1,
024,037 tons during tho month of No
vember. It will be pretty hard for the trust
to persuade tho American people that
It needs "protection" undor such cir
cumstances. Tho good.old tariff graft
hogging sounds rnther' unconvincing
these days.

Colonol Roosevelt Is getting old.

Democrat, Bad Outlook for Republicans.
Tho noxt tariff Ibsuo Is going to be
somewhat different than It has been
In tho past, so that tho Republicans
will not be ablo to say that a Dem
ocratic tariff has Injured American
Industry, They will simply havo to
assert that unless the schedules are
raised thoro will bo a flood of chenp
goods from Europo after tho war to
depress American trade and lower
American wages. And tuoy will havo

Two or threo months ago the com
pany had $23,000,000 In cash and
looked for investments. Tho directors
appointed a committee to invest tho
money. Tho treasurer was intrusted
by the committee with the job and
bought largo blocks of stocks !n com
panies that have been turning out war
material. Theso largo investment pur
chases havo so reduced the floating

Peculiarity of French Flag.
It Is not genorally known that tho
threo strips of color that make up tho
French national flag aro not equal in
width. When tho tri-color was first
authorized, 1792, the positions and
proportions of the threo colors wero
not Btated, and such a variety ot flags
was seen that two years later tho na
tional assembly declared that tho na
tional standard should be formed of
"the three national colors in equal
bands placed vertically, tho hoist be
ing blue, tho middle white, and tho
fly red."
For years tho flag was mado In this
way, but though the bands wero equal,
they never looked equal owing to an
optical Illusion, tho bluo appearing
wider than the whlto, and the whlto
wider than tho red.
At last, after many experiments, it
was officially decided that In every
hundred parts tho bluo should be
thirty, whlto thirty-three and red thirty-seven.

loses In deceased! Onco he failed la
business, but thanked heaven ho had
his health. Another time ho failed
in health, but thanked heaven ho had
his business. Then, Just before ho en
tered hero, ho fallod In health and
business simultaneously and said:
" 'Oh, well, what good is tho ono
without tho other?" " Washington
