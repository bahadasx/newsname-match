Geneva, Dee. 28—A dispatch to
the Tribune from Vienna says
"Chancellor von Bethmann llol
weg is expected in Vienna shortly
with the full conditions under
which the Central Powers will ac
cept peace. After discussing the
terms with Baron von Burian the
Austrian Foreign Minister, the
conditions will be officially an
nounced to the allies, Germany
suggesting that the first confer
ence be held at The Hague."
Paris, Dec. 30.—The Austrian
destroyer I.itta was blown up by
a mine and the destroyer Triglav
sunk in a naval action with an al
lied squadron in the Adriatic off
Durazzo, the ministry of marine
announced today.
"An Austrian squadron left Cat
tero to bombard Durazzo and en
countered an allied squadron that
gave battle," said the official com
munique. "The Austrian destroyer
Litta was blown up by a mine and
the destroyer Tiiglav was sunk.
The other enemy ships fied."
The destroyer Triglav was built

w as 266 feet long. She was one of
the newest Austrian destroyers,

ried a crew of about 90 men.
