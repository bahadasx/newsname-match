' Nothing has ever given the resi
dents bf Pioche and Lincoln county
such a prfjund' s'aoqk as did the
news last Tuesday morning- that
Jake Johnson was dead. Many were
Iota Jto believe that the old familiar
land marie had departed this life.
Nev'rUfeless it was rea; his laoc
on ear'th was finished and he had
beyi MLed to his reward.
On Christmas flay he met hid
friends in (the usual way; yet co a
few! with wnom ha haa close assoJ
elation for many years he coniplaln
eu' f not feeling well; Suniia.y ne
appeared to he in good spirits; but
Aioncjay evening he iealled to. see
J. A. Nesbitt sh-afcly afcer the movie
show. After talking with Mr. Nesbitt
for awhile he said: "Jim, T am all
in. If I. am not.' around by 8 o'clock
ia tne morning .send down to the
iijusa and get the keys to the jail
ai. !uav some cue feea ins vr.sun
e.U" Nesbitt' could see that some
thing worried Jake, but talked cheer
uim ana toid nan lo g
hv-ne ajid get u wjod s.eep; thai
he would f -Ml all nht In the morn
ing. Jim was tne last man he spoke
ts up town: Just before 9 o'clock
in thei morning he was found dean
In 'bed by C. VV. Uar.lson and Johu
aJwmis who called to get the kejS
to the jail. Mrs. Johnson had been
,up with her husband during the.
r.icM land had ta ked with hin:;
scarcely an hour before Ga-.rison anu
n..jig tame.
When she left him Jake thought
he could go t sleep but it wias thai
s.-eep which knows no awakening.
Apparently the end came quitely and
P3U.JciUly.
Jase Johnson came to Lincoln coun
ty many years ago and was a con
spicuous figure around the mines as
a taamstJ-'. He fiist entered offic
ial life by accepting the appointment
of ueputy. when H. E. Freuden
thal was sheriff of Lincoln County
wjhich then comprised all of what,
is now Linlcoln and Clark counties.
At the conclusion of Mr. Freuden
thal's term of office Jake John3cn
was .elqOted sheriff and succeeded
himself three more terms. The
fifth time he ran he w,as defeated by
Phil K Smith, who appointed him
as h!s deput?. Johnson retained ths
deputyship under SherlffO. H.
Smith; filled the unexpired tjrm of
tnel later as sheriff and when DaiJ
J. Ronnow was elected was again ap
dpolnted deputy and served in that
icaoacity up tp the time of nis deam.
Whll Jake Johnson had his faults,
as every man has, he posessed many
sterling qua.ities. He was 1 fearless
and faithful in the performance cf
uujy. His is-.ends were many and
his enemies few. He will bo missed;
particular y a.ound th i court rcom
where he had been a conspicuous fig
ure Ifor all the years of his official
a&i eer.
The funeral wtas conducted from
the Union Sunday School buildin?
Thursday afternoon nnder the direc
tion of. Jlev. Smith cf the Episcopal
Mission.' During the services, at
the request of members of the fam
ily, the! Mormon hymn, "Oh, My
Father" was sung by the choir. This
hymn was a favorite of the; deceased.
Judge Harsey delivered an eloquent
eulogistic address.
Interment took place In the I. O.
O. F. cemetry. 1
The Record joins with the friends
of the bereaved family in extending
heartfelt sympathy. 1
COURT PAYS RESPECT
TO JAKE
JOHNSON
When the district court was call
ed Tuesday afternoon, after Henry
L?e had been duly appoindte admin
istrator of the estate of Jamesi
Mathews, deceased, and Father Dan
iel Slattery had been authorized to
solemnize marriages In this county,
Juj-e Horsey took occasion to me
tlon the fact tlhat no more would he
'be! able, to hear the voice of thfj
faithful under-sheriff. Jake Johnson,
as he pronounced the,' words "Hear
ye, hear ye." Jake had been call
ed to the Great Beyond, and the
Judge believed that it would be only
a small token of the hlsh esteem in
whicbi the departed officer of the
cipurt had been held, to make a few
remarks in connection with his
loyalty, fearlessness, honesty and
integrity. , !
The Judge then delivered a par
tlcularly eloquent eulogy . in the
course of which he dwelt upon Mr.
Johnson s onerous duties while a
defcroty sht'riff and later on asi
sheriff, when Lincoln and Clark coun
ties were one; when th pay vnit
rediculously small, but the demands
of the offUa greai. He spoke oC
. his association and co-operation with
Mr. Johnson wnen he himself wa
district attorney, and his associations
Called
To The Other Side
with him since that time as an offic
er of the court, during all of which
period he had found Mr. Johnson
characterled by marked ablll7
and fidelity in his particular line of
duty; by which hei had secu.-ed and
held' the respect and gratitude of
his fellow citizens. If he had an
enemy, It was himself; but, in the,
words of the (court, "I have yet to
meet the man who Is perfect that
man I cannot expect to meet, un
less lt( should be in the life here
after." '
Tia court then called upon the1
members of the bar present, to ex
press their sympathy, and District
Attorney Wm. E. Orr and A. L. Scott
responded. At tha conclusion cf
their remarks, court was declared
adjourned out of respect to the mem-'
ory cf its departed officer, Jake John
son, until after his funeral.
3PECULATION AS TO
JOHNSON'S SUCCESSOR
Inhere is considerable speculation
going the rounds as to who will suc
ceed, tha late Jake Johnson as dep
uty sheriff and jailor at Pioche
It Is. likely that Sheriff Ronnow will
not announce an appointment until
the meeting of county commission
ejs here next week.
As C. P. Ch:istensen cf Caliente is
Mr. Ronnow's deputy at Caliente
the impression prevails that he will
be given the Pioche appointment as
it carries $25 per month more salary
than he, is now getting as deputy in
the railroad town and in point of
sarvlca is entitled to ill It is saiu1
,oo, that Mr. Chr'istensen would like
to be) advanced ' to the chief deputy-,
ship. He arrived in town Wednes
day morning and, at the request o
Sheriff Ronnow. has been performing
those duties which formerly devolv
ed upon Mr. Johnson.

ten cars or 500 tons per day.

Notwlthstandlng the inclemettcy of
tha weather this week, work hasi
been going on with the excavations
for the new Consolidated Nevada
Utah mill and it is expected that,
the working force at the site of tha
plant will be materially Increased to
day. Practically all of the equipment!
and material for the plant has been
ordered. The company has arrang
ed for the 100-horse power gasoline
engine formerly in use at the prop4
eitles of the Providence Mines &
Commercial comnanv. At the nresfent
time! this engine is In use at thT
Prince mine, but is to be moved tot

than otherwise would be the) case.
As stated In last1 week's issue of

POLITICAL GOSSIP
Word comes :.om Caliente that CP
Chrlstensen. at present, deputy sher-" l4
iff at that point, will baaj&9didate
for election to the office of sheriff
of Lincoln county next fall. It is 'f.
also reported from reliable authority ai
lihat Joe Holllnger of Eagle Valley
will be a candidate; while friends
of Ed Deck are urging him to try I: ,
for the Democratic nomination. Deck v.
was a candidate for the nomination'
In 1914 and' was defeated in th
primaries by nine votes by Dan Ron
aow. This makes four men mention
ed for sheriff, R. R. Orr being tihe
first in the field for the Republican,
nomination. '
Caliente will have anther candi
date. W. A. Denton, son of former
Senator J. A. Denton, has announc
ed that he will go before, the county
convention as a candidate for coun
ty clerk on th Democratic ticket.
There seems to be a demand anion-
Democrats for Dam Ronnow to ac
cept the Democratic nomination for
assessor. He has made a good rec-
oril they say, and that It would be
mistake to displace him. It is be
lieved Dan will make the run.l
Torn Osborne is spoken of as the
probable nominee of the Republi
cans for district attorney.
ICuiJ Bladd of Caliente has many
friends who want him to run for,
county recorder. He was a candidate
last year against C. W. Garrison, but
was defeated. The argument Is put '
forth that he,, is better known in tha
county now, which would be a big
factor In his behalf.
