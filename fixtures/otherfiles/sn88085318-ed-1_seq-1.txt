OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
An eastern exchange remarks
that 1916 will witness three
eclipses—of the sun, of the moon,
and of the G. 0. P.
One of the joyous features of
New Year's day in England is the
knowledge that in paying the
heavy war tax, the people are still
paying it to England—and not to
the Kaiser.
As if to prove the old predic
tions of the G. 0. P. that a demo
cratic reign would devastate this
country's commercial interests,
the Association of Western Rail
ways has issued a circular letter
to all shippers of the west, urg
ing them to load and unload all
cars as quickly as possible, to al
ways load to full capacity, and
to expedite shipping, as there is
a great shortage of cars, and the
tonnage required to be moved is
so great that sufficient cars can
not be secured.
Despite rumors and interviews
and forebodings of delay, word
from the department of the in
terior assures us that the Colville
reservation will be opened this
summer. Secretary Lane has an
nounced that the reservation will
be opened, Indian Commissioner
Cato Sells now agrees that this
will be done, and a letter from
Congressman Dill to the Exam
iner states that he does not look
for any further trouble or delay
—which is the most assuring of
all. since Mr. Dill is the man who
is politically able to get the re
sult desired.
Mr. Sells still desires to make
a reservation out of the timber
country. Dill is opposed to
further closing the lands of his
district, and as he is on the In
dian committee, and the public
lands committee, it is probable
that Mr. Sells will not get very
far with his desire.
Under the old plan of manage
ment, some commissioner or gov
ernment clerk or high school
graduate in department service
could determine the course of
events for this western country,
and all the congressmen we sent
were not able to get close enough
to the higher-up officials to get
any relief. Dill put a new angle
on things by going direct to the
higher officials, and finding in
Secretary Lane a man who un
derstands western conditions, and
with President Wilson favorable
to the lone democratic congress
man from the northwest, we get
results where none have appeared
in years.
NEW LIQUOR LAW.
While the citizen who lays away
a supply of liquors in his cellar
before Jan. 1, will be free from
molestation under the search and
seisure provisions of the state
law, according to Louis B. Ilorton,
superintendent of the anti-saloon
league, one "wet" party which
gets too loud will be likely to lead
to sudden confiscation of the host's
stores.
"We do not want to be hard
on the man who wants to keep his
own supply for personal consump
tion,'' Mr. Ilorton declared, "but
the situation is plainly one which
puts the law on trial
"The citizen who puts his
liquors quietly away in his cellar
and consumes them in the ordin
ary fashion will not be in danger,
but the man who has a drunken
carousal, a noisy gathering or
two, or anything else that will
help create the impression and at
titude that prohibition does not
make any difference and things
are just the same, will be hauled
into court and his place cleaned
out. It won't make any differ
ence who he is.
"We shall He here to see that
prohibition is enforced, especially
during the next six months, be
cause if it isn't enforced it will
be repealed. If business condi-

. —By order of D. R. Ise.
tions are not better, if drunken
ness is not Jess, prohibition will
not be permanent. We intend
that it shall be. Private drinking
parties can become just as great
an evil as the open saloon if they
are left inchecked. We don't in
tend that they shall be.
"This law won't any more en
force itself than will the law
against murder. It has never
been the league's policy to follow
the vMD.cv-.ncnt of the law, but
we do intend to follow the en
forcement of this one."
George D. Conger, superinten
dent of the league in western
Washington, declared in Seattle
recently that prohibition would
result in increased business, espe
cially for all amusement theaters,
and joined Ml. Ilorton's state
ment that private stocks quietly
consumed would not draw prose
cution for their owners.
"We will not participate in any
crusade of a fanatical nature," he
said. "Unless there is proof of
deliberate violation of the law
during its disposal to others, we
will take no part in search-war
rant actions."—Spokesman-Re

Two measures affecting elec
tions and politics generally which
the last legislature passed are to
<jo into effect today, while a third,
which would have made some rad
ical difference in the conduct of
party conventions during the 1916
campaign, was nipped by the ref
erendum, and held off for a vote of
the people.
The most important of the ef
fective laws is the four-year regis
tration measure, championed by
\V\ If. Whitney, a republican
leader in Seattle. This makes
registration compulsory with resi
dents of districts outside of the
limits of incorporated cities and
towns, who have hitherto been
t > vote without registering.
\ voter who does register, votes
at every general election and does
not change his residence, under
the new law needs only to register
ia advance of each presidential
election. After that his name will

registering being needed only
when lie moves or fails to vote;.
Fn the country the county com
missioners iniiHt appoint for each
precinct a registration official,
who will get five cents a name for
every one registered. City regis
tration will remain in the hands
of the p-esent officials.

AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
(News letter from C. C. Dill,
congressman, sth district of Wash
ington.)
Congress organized before
Christmas and that is about all
it did. Organization attracts but
little attention from the country
as a whole, but it is in realty ex
tremely important.
Somebody has said. "Let me
write the songs of a nation and I
care not who makes its laws."
In the above connection this might
-w«ll be paraphrased to read, "Let
me form the committees of con
gress and I care not who writes
the bills or makes the speeches.''
This is largely true too, because
every bill introduced into con
gress is immediataely referred to
the proper committee. In the
committee room it is either re
ported favorably, amended, or
killed.
How then were the committees
of this congress appointed?
In theory, by the membership
of each house. In practice, by a
few men to whom has been dele
gated the power to make com
mittee assignments. All the dem
ocrats of the house were assigned
by the 14 democratic members of
the Ways and Means Committee,
and all the republicans by the re
publican leader, James B. Mann.
In the senate, the new senators
were assigned to committees by
a steering committee of nine mem
bers, chosen for the purpose by
each party. The one progressive
in the house who entered the dem
ocratic caucus was assigned by
the democrats, while the remain
ing seven progressives were as
signed by the republicans. The
democrats enlarged the committee
on labor to take care of the lone
socialist member.
Of course every committee is
under democratic control by a
sufficiently large majority to en
able it to report favorably on any
party measure. Only a few of
the committees have begun work,
but the nature of most of the
legislation which will be passed
by this congress, was largely de
termined when the committees
were formed. It is probable that
in bills dealing with the most
talked of questions such as pre
paredness and rural credits and
WHter power, some important
changes will be made on the; floor
of the house or senate, but that is
not true of most of the bills which
will come of committee rooms for
passage. That is why I was espe
cially insistent that I be placed on
the committee on Indian Affairs
and the committee on Public
Lands.
