Austria has subscribed to the prin-
ciple that no ships will be sunk until i
resistance is offered or they flee, with-
I out persons aboard being brought to
safety. This is considered a far-reaching
and satisfactory assurance. The
German ambassador conferred with

characterized Austria's statements in

editions contain no editorial comment

Gazette speaks of the Austrian note
as the cold-blooded narrative, appar-i

says further "that a man could act as

that his government can forward his

to another government as a paliation
of his conduct this, indeed, is a sharp
reminder to us of the nature of the
