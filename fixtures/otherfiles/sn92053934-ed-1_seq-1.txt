That Amount.
Des Moines, Jan. 1. The state of
Iowa today entered the "dry column"
when the doors of mors than 500 sa
loons In its various cities and towns
were closed under satutory prohibi
tion, because of the so-called mulct
law repeal which went into effect at
midnight last night. At the same time
the 15 breweries of the state went out
of business.
As the result of the mulct law re
peal becoming effective the county,
city and federal governments will sus
tain a loss of $765,650, which hereto
fore had been received annually from
tno saloons in the form of license tax.
1,1 ltlls amount the cities win lose
$602,400, counties $150,600 and the
federal government $12,550, according
t( slate officials here. There were 502
saloons operating in Iowa up to last
night.
Developments which might lead to
a test of the mulct law repeal in the
courts of the state were not expected
to materialize before Monday because
of the fact that today and tomorrow
are holidays. Statements reaching the
attorney general s office during the
week were to the effect that saloon-
I keepers in Davenport and Keokuk had
planned to re-open their places ot
business on Monday with a view to
furnishing the desired test cases. At
torney General Cosson was to go to
Davenport today for the purpose of
investigating conditions there and tak
ing whatever steps might be necessary
to prosecute the state's side of the
promised test cases.
The growing hostility toward the
liquor business which has been mani
fest in the general assemblies of Iowa
for a number of years, reached its
culmination in the Thirty-sixth general
issembly last spring in the passage
of a number of acts desiirned to whol
the state were authorized to issue
search warrants for the seizing of 11

According to the new state laws,

SMS DISABLED
CRAFT LOCATED
Newport, R. I., Jan. 1. A message
from an unidentified sioamer picked
up by the radio station here early to
day, stated that shes had taken the dis
abbsdjsteamer .TJw.asaJoijikt in low -and
was proceeding to New York. Because
of weather conditions, the name of the
vessel and her position could not be
learned.
The message said that the Thessa
lonikl was short of "steaming water,"
which indicated serious engine trouble.
The weather along the coast was thiclt
and the radio station had great diffi
culty in reading the message. The
coast guard cutter Seneca had report
ed during the night that she was still
trying to locate the Thessalonikl but
had been unable to get in touch with
her.
The steamer Florizel has been
searching for the disabled vessel since
early yesterday but it was not known
here early today whether she was the
ship which reported that she had
reached the Thessaloniki.
The radio station continued its ef
forts to get further advices.

DEATH TOLL IS HEAVY
Most of the Passengers and
Crew of Ill-Fated Vessel
Are Reported Lost.
London, Jan. 1, (10:42 a. m.)
The British liner Persia was sunk
Thursday and most of the passen
gers and crew were lost.
Robert Mc'elly, American con-.
snl at Aden was a passenger. - -
A Lloyds dispatch says that
most of the passengers and men of
the Persia were lost. ' -
Four boats got clear before the
Persia sank.
In addition to Mr. McN'elly two other
Americans are known tn havo hooh
passengers on the Persia when she left
London. Charles H. Grant was on his' promlse of reparation for loss of
way to Bombay. Edward Rose, a school I American lives, despite the absence of
boy was on the way from Denver to'proof as to just how they came to
Gibraltar. Rose probably landed at
Gibraltar and was not on board the
boat at the time she was sunk.
160 Passengers On Ship.
The Peninsular and Oriental line
estimates that 160 or 161 passengers
sailed froni London on the Persia. A
number of these landed at Gibraltar,
Marseilles or Malta. No official fig
ures are available.
, In addition. to tlie. passengers- who-
sailed from London, a large number
embarked at Marseilles. The total
booked at tb .se points was 231. Of
these 87 were women and 25 children.
Lord Montagu was on the passenger
list.
The Persia was sunk in the eastern
Mediterranean off the island of Crete.
The message to Lloyds says the Per
sia was on her way from London to
Bombay. She was sunk at 1 o'clock
on Thursday afternoon.
News Troubles Washington.
Washington, Jan. 1. Official dis
patches from London today said the
liner Persia was torpedoed and sunk
"while approaching Alexandria" and
that "nearly all perished."
Officials who were not away for the
holiday viewed the news with some
anxiety, fearing the sinking of the
British liner might complicate the al
ready delicate submarine situation.
Robert McNelly was making his first
trip to a consular post for the United
States government, having been ap
pointed Oct, 18 last, and assigned to
Aden. His home is at Monroe, North
Carolina and he was a member of the
North Carolina legislature from 1908
to 1910. He is 32 years old.
The dispatch came from Consul Gen
eral Skinner at London and probably
was based on the British admiralty
report. It follows:
"P. and O. liner Persia reported
sunk, submarined while approaching
Alexandria. Robert N. McNelly, Ameri
can consul, Aden, going to post, left
London as passenger. Nearly all on
board perished."
Left Bombay 'ov. 14.
The Persia was a steamer of 7,974
tons gross. She was owned by the Pen
insular and Oriental Steam Navigation
company of London. She sailed from
Bombay, Nov. 14, for London and was
last reported as leaving Gibraltar on
Dec. 2. :
Robert N. McNally was appointed as
consul at Aden, Arabia, in October,
1914. He was a native of North Car
plinav .
Boute Throngh Snb Zone.
The Persia was one of several ves
sels recently sunk by submarines in
the eastern Mediterranean, through
which her course to the Suez canal
would take here from Malta. On Dec.
24 the French line Ville de la Ciotat
was sent to the bottom off the Island
of Crete by a submarine which, ac
cording to unofficial British advices,
flew the Austrian flag.
Sailing Date Unknown.
No advices have been received In
New Y'ork as to the date of which the
Persia sailed from London. She de
parted some time in advances of her
advertised date of sailing, which was
Jan. 15. The voyage from London to
Malta ordinarily requires nine days.
The Persia was built in 1960 at
Greenock." Sbe has been in the Bom
bay service since that time.
On account of the danger from sub
marines to vessels which pass through
the Suez canal and the Mediterranean
this route has been abandoned by the

OFFICIALS NOW
TURN ATTENTION
TO FINAL REPLY
Washington, Jan.-1. With the tens
ion between the United : States and
Austria growing out of the destruction
of the liner Ancona which had threat
ened a severance of diplomatic rela
tions between the two' countries, brok
en by Austria's favorable response to
the American demands, administration
officials today turned their attention
to the preparation of another note to
the Vienna government.
President Wilson at Hot Springs,
Va., is studying the Austrian reply,
the official " text of which had been
translated to him by special messen
ger immediately after its receipt yes
terday from Ambassador Penfield at
Vienna. The-situation over the An
cona incident is now believed to have
cleared up to such an extent as not to
necessitate the president's return to
Washington before the. middle of next
week. It ..is expected, however, that
he will confer with Secretary Lansing
over the long distance phone regarding
the forthcoming note after he has
carefully considered the Austrian re
ply. r ,
The new note will acknowledge Aus
tria's concessions, and also probably
will cover, the points left by Austria
for further discussion.,; These relate
principally to questions of fact which
affect Austria's responsibility for what
happened, before the submarine com
mander torpedoed the Ancona, the 1m-
) Prtance of .which is lessened by the
their death.
The principal American demands in
the Anacona case punishment of the
submarine commander and assurances
regarding the future conduct of sub
marine warfare on merchant vessels,
have been met in Austria's reply.
underwriters to three or four times
the normal figure.
Lord Charles Montagu, who hooked
passage on the Persia is a London
stock broker. He was born in 1860 and
served with the Y'eomanry cavalry.
Complicates Matters.
Destruction of the British liner Per
sia with possible loss of American
lives, throws relations between the
United States and the Teutonic pow
ers into a new danger.
Coming almost at the hour when a
satisfactory adjustment of the deli
cate situation was at hand by Austria's
acceptance of the cardinal points of
the American demands in the Ancona
case, this new element threatens to
complicate affairs with Austria as
thoroughly as the destruction of the
Arabic, following so closely the Lusi
tania exchanges, brought on a renew
ed crisis with Germany.
From such Incomplete Information
as was at hand today the two situa
tions are regarded as almost parallel.
It was generally presumed in official
circles that as was the crisis with
Germany, the Austrian admiralty and
the Vienna foreign office are working
at cross purposes..
It was regarded as a strong possi
bility that while the foreign office is
ready to accede to the contentions of
the United States the admiralty, bent
on the success of its submarine poller
has not yet been brought into line.
Sub 'ot Instructed 1 v
i There Is however, the added possi
bility that the submarine which sunk
the Persia, being far from home, had
not been instructed in the new policy
of the Austrian government.
The destruction of the Persia, cou
pled with the recent sinking of the
Japanese liner Yasaka Maru and the
French liner Ville de la Ciotat, lends
strength in official quarters to both
these possibilities.
All the agencies of the American
government have been set in motion
to gather facts on the newest dis
aster, and the fact that Secretary
Lansing, and other officials today de
clined to comment in the absence of
complete information does not alter
the crucial aspect which this latest
