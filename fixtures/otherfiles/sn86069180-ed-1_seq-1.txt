MERCHANTS PROTEST STRONGLY
Ono predominating feature from
an American standpoint in the pres
ent European war Is the unfairness
of the great majority of the press of
the country in discussing conten
tions arising with the different con
tenders engaged. Any news antag
onistic to Germany is featured, while
any news unfavorable to the others,
and England especially, is published
In an obscure part of the paper with
doubting headlines "as an introduc
tion. Onjy recently six German sub
jects were removed from American
ships In West India waters by a
French cruisers with no reason given
save that they were Germans. This
is In direct "violation of the prin
ciples which the United States has
always stood for, and in accordance
with which it released the Confed
erate Commissioners Mason and
Blldell, who were taken from a
British vessel by a Federal cruiser
during the civil war. Secretary of
State Lansing cabled to the Ameri
can Ambassador a protest agalnBt
the high-handed seizure, but to date
the daily papers above mentioned
are not emphasizing that protest.
During the different stages of our
protest to Germany and Austria this
same press went into hysterics at
tempting to arouse sentiment
against those two countries.
Now take England,' for example,
in regard to the tying up of our ex
port and import trade. This is an
Injustice to our merchants and busi
ness men and a blow to the country
in general, but the pro-English press
in its mad attacks on the Kaiser
"ana-militarism Is too busy to take
cognizance of this outrage. Apropos
of this a writer in Leslie's Weekly
says:
Two glaring instances may be
cited, although there are many oth
ers on record. In the Birkfeldt filter
case the facts briefly stated are as
follows: The clay which is used in
the production of these filters is
found only in Germany. The filter
Is the only one known that Is wholly
satisfactory for the filtration of anti
toxins and for that purpose It is cm
ployed in medical research work, in
laboratories, In hospitals and by phy
sicians. An American firm of im
porters ordered a supply of theso
Biters prior to March 1, 1915, and
filed an application for their release
from Rotterdam, complying exactly
with thfe requirements of the- British
Government. The caso hung fire for
months, being delayed on one pre
test or another. In the interval
there came a letter-from an English
manufacurer offering to supply the
American firm with niters, for scien
tific use, and claiming superiority
for his article over the Birkfeldt ono.
This offer was followed by others
from different British manufacturers,
showing that Information about the
order for the Birkfeldt filter had
"leaked" and that the British manu
facturers wero endeavoring to make
use of it to introduce their goods
Into this market.
Another case Is that of an order
for $1,000 worth of glass scientific
instruments for research work at the
Rockefeller Institute. Theso goods,
after much effort, wero Teleased.
But the British Embassy added to
tho letter authorizing their liberation
substantially this statement "Sim
ilar goods may be bought as cheaply
in England and it is confidently ex
pected that future orders for them
will bo placed with British manufac
turers, which will avoid such delays
as applicant has erperienced." This
was signed bj the British Ambas
sador. These and similar Instances show
that tho 'nformatlon obtained from
American importers is not hold In
confident b the British authorities,
but in some way gets to manu
facturers and exporters, who use it
to further their own trade. Not only
has England practically killed the
business of our Importers from Ger
many and Austria but she has also
stopped all exports from tho United
States to either of these belligerents.
As a consequence neutral lines of
steamers plying to Europe, rather
than have their vessels held up,
searched and cargoes confiscated, re
fuse to accept in this country any
goods intended for enemies of Groat
Britain, and will not carry goods
that are not certlfiod by tho British
Consuls in America.
While Great Britain is suggesting
to American merchants that they
should buy from British, sources in
stead of from Germany or Austria,
she is also restricting exports from
the United States to neutral coun
tries to an extent that suggests that
sho is endeavoring to force Importers
In neutral European countries to or
der American goods from British
dealers, who in turn order them from
America, and make a wax profit on
them. This has been charged re
peatedly, and there 1b confirmation
of this charge in the rapid recovery
of the British re-export trade, which
v
fell away to almost nothing in tho
early days of tho war. From tho be
ginning the British attempted to
J make the national motto "Business
as usual." Even now It seems that,
while they have found that nothing
can be as usual during war, they are
straining themselves and their ethics
to keep the mercantile machine in
operation.
Tho truth is that Great Britain,
through tho strength of her navy
and the extent of her mercantile
marine, has a firm grasp on tho trado
of the world and means to keep it.
Her superiority In sea trado is espe
cially effective at this time, when
the war has removed through In
ternment, destruction or com
mandeering more than one-quarter of
the world's sea-going tonnage from
peaceful commerce. It would seem
that this advantage should satisfy
her and that she should bo above
resorting to small tricks to further
her commercial interests.
INTO ETERNAL REST.
Christmas morning God called to
her heavenly reward Sister Mary
Bonaventura. for over fifty years a
member of the Ursulino order and
for the greater part of that time a
teacher in the parochial schools of
this city. Sister Mary died from
the effects of a paralytic stroke she
suffered eleven days before while
making some fancy work as a pres
ent for another Sister. The stroke
occurred just as the aged nun was
finishing the needlework in tlte
presence of other Sisters, whom sho
had called to her room to see the
piece. For a week sho had prayed
that she might die the day tho
Christ Child was born. By a strange
coincidence it also was the day on
which sho had planned to give tho
fancy work to her colleague. Sister
Bonaventura was born in Cincinnati
seventy years ago. Her worldly
name was Miss Catherine Ricdenger
and she was educated in the schools
of the Ursulino Sisters. Fifty-one
years ago she made her religious
profession as a member of the
Louisvillo branch of tho Ursulino
Sisters, whoso mother house Is at
805 East Chestnut street. After re
ceiving holy communion, as she had
been praying that sho might be able
to do, sho passed away just before
noon with her companions in the
religious profession gathered about
the bedside at the mother house on
East Chestnut street. Tho funoral
was held Monday morning from the
convent chapel, and was attended
by relatives and friends from Cin
cinnati and this city.

decided that an organization to han
dle tho supreme convention of the

was stated that this was ono of the
most enthusiastic meetings held In

Point to - Even Greater
Distress.
OUTLOOK APPEARS MOST GRAVE
After conducting relief work for
several months in' Mexico, in re
sponse to an appeal from tho people
of that country, the American Red
Cross has recently withdrawn at
the roquest of Gen. Carranza. This
request came just at a time when
increased relief funds wero available
from the American public, including
a special appropriation from the
Rockefeller foundation. This re
quest came with assurance from tho
Mexican Government that adequate
plans for the relief of suffering wero
boing carried out and that tho Red
Cross was no longer needed. In the
middle of October, when the Red
Cross agent, Charles J. O'Connor,
left Mexico City, however, he felt
thot tho situation was, serious. He
had found that the official record of
burials In ono cemetery in the early
part of August gave starvation as
the cause of 8 per cent, of the
deaths. How the lack of food with
tho help of typhus has swelled the
death rate may be gathered from tho
deaths In tho Federal district. .In
early Ootober the daily number of
deaths was about 300 In a population
of about 700,000. Tho normal num
ber used to bo eighty-one, or a death
rate of about forty. The death rate
In early October was thus in thfc
neighborhood of 150 to 1C0, or ten
times that of Now York City.
Conservative estimates place tho
number of people living on charity
in some form a's at least 100,000,
and probably as high as 200,000.
Money of tho Constitutionalist Gov
ernment was worth.only a, small-part
of its face value, $15,000 being equal
to about $1,000 of United States
currency. A small loaf of bread
sold for $1, a larger olaf for $2, and
a cake of soap for $1. Yet wages
were paid on substantially tho old
values a laborer receiving about
$1 a day. Industry was paralyzed
and even where Jobs could bo had
It was not surprising that men re
fused to work at such a wage. Tho
foresight of Americans and other
foreigners had led them to buy large
supplies of corn and beans last
January. These they used for their
families and employes, selling small
quantities to the latter at a low
price. But for this forehanded
action many office clerks, store sales
men and factory operatives would
have starved. Some employers kept
their employes on their pay rolls at
much sacrifice.
When the Red Cross agent went
from Vera Cruz to Mexico City it
was some weeks before supplies
could be brought in because of the
fighting lines around tho city. For
tho early Red Cross relief $18,000
was available. With a largo part of
this money a supply of "chick pea"
was purchased. This vegetable Is
not eaten very much In Mexico, but
Is exported to Spain, whore It Is
known as garbanzza. With this sup
ply, which the owner had not been
able to export, and with somo meat
and vegetables, a soup was prepared
for distribution through eight sta
tions In various parts of tho city and
four In tho suburbs. About 30,000
liters of soup wero distributed dally
to 15,000 families.
From all groups In tho community
the Red Cross received splendid co
operation. As many as 1,000 volun
teer Investigators from clubs,
churches, tho foreign colonies and
various sorts of organizations ren
dered efficient service. The applica
tions of about 27,000 families were
approved and about 14,000 applica
tions wcrp ponding. It Is estimated
that probably 150,000 people needed
relief. Such a number could have
been kept alive for from $30,000
to $40,000 a month. Cordial rela
tions were early established with the
International Charity Committee, or
ganized by foreign residents rcpre
sentlpg seventeen nationalities. The
method of this committee was to sell
food at low cost, but it had difficulty
In obtaining supplies. It was asked
by the Constitutionalist Government
to discontinue tho work about tho
time tho request was mado to tho
Rod Cross.
Tho relief work of tho Mexican
Government was well planned, but It
was not adequately supported. It
provided, among other things, for
the salo of food at low prices from
Government stores. For lack of sup
plies theso sometimes closed, how
ever, within a few days after they
opened or had for salo only part of
tho articles advertised. Moreover
tho poor often did not have the
money to buy oven at the low price.
At tho time of tho request to with
draw, tho Red Cross, after a period
of uncertainty as to whether funds
would be supplied by the American
people, was planning a, renewal of its
work on a largo scale. Tho with
drawal necessitated the abandonment
pf the soup stations, except in a few
cases where neighborhood commit
tees took: them over, The poor crops
of this year point to even greater
distress and starvajtloti in the months
ahead, and the normal planting was
not done owing to'ttho fear of farm
ers that the soldiers would take
everything they cotild and that there
would bo difficulty in selling pro
duce: The outlook appears to be
extremely grave. r

Roman Question an Important
Prolilcm Wllich Europe
I
Must Solve.
1-
Matter of Independence of the
Holy Sec Can Scarcely Be
Evaded.
SOLUTION WILL BENEFIT WORLB
Not the least of the important
problems which Europe must en
deavor to solve at tho conclusion of
the present conflict is the vital and
Imperative Roman question. The
matter of the Independence of the
Holy See can scarcely bo evaded.
Whether they will or not, tho con
ference of tho powers will almost
certainly havo to concern them
selves with this unsettled problem,
the DroDer solution of which will
not only mean benefit for the
church but the welfare or Europe
as well. A number of continental
law experts, especially Fillppo Crls
opltl In Italy, havo shown of late
how untenable the break-down of
tho law of guarantees has mado tho
present situation. Tito present
Pontiff, because of the many press
ing necessities of tho time, has
wisely refrained from pushing for
ward this matter until tho proper
moment will arrlv(e for its consid
eration. At the same time he has
not departed one lota from the his
toric position of his predecessors. In
fact it is most interesting to note
how harmoniously his views accord
with those of tho 'beloved Plus and
how this policy " In turn coincides
with the unmistakable position of
Leo XIII.
A-jrflcejitUntervjw In Uiq r Vienna
Relchspost, the great Catholic pa
per of Austria, with one of tho
prominent Cardinals who haa
worked in the Roman Curia under
tho late Pontiff, gives us an inter
esting insight into the attitude of
Pius X. on the question. It shows
us, too, in a surprising manner how
keenly the great church reformer
understood tho situation in Europe.
As Patriarch of Venico, tho then
Cardinal Sarto, in the course of
several festivities, had occasion to
come Into contact with members of
the Italian royal family, which fact
at the time of his elevation to tho
Pontificate gave rise to tho rumor
that the Pope would seek closer re
lations with tho Quirlnal. Time
proved how absolutely mistaken this
idea had been, for though Pius did
not Insist upon an immediate con
clusion of the irritating situation,
ho did not fail to let it be known
as to his views on the matter.
"Pius X.", as his former assistant
in the Curia tells the Relchspost,
"was far removed from minimizing
tho Roman question In tho midst
of tho religious labors of his Pon
tificate. Much to tho contrary, ho
concerned himself very Intensely
with tho question of. tho complete
Independence of the Holy See. As
if he had had a presentiment of tho
war troubles of tho ensuing years,
tho Pope ever greatly feared that
tho law of guarantees would in tho
decisive moment show Itself inap
propriate and worthless. At tho
same time, Pius X. was well awaro
of tho fact that tho 'how' of tho
solution of tho Roman question was
veiled in great darkness. The Pope's
hope of a solution did not rest on
theoretical propositions nor on
diplomatic deliberations on Interna
tional contracts. Plus X. declared
that in splto of the present uncer
tainty the solution of the Roman
question would come automatically
as a work of Divine Providence, In
a wav that would render Insignifi
cant all previous attempts at a solu
tion." Thus is revealdd tho singular
foresight of tho Pope who was
sneeringly declared to bo of tho
poorest of diplomats. It stands
forth, in striking contrast to the ruin
and chaos which tho great states
men of Europe havo brought upon
themselves. That it forms the basis
of the present Papal policy Is in
deed encouraging. In his expressions
on the situation last June, the Papal
Secretary of State, Cardinal Gaspari.
practically re-echoed tho thoughts of
Plus X. Tho Pope, ho told us,
"thinks first of tho miseries of tho
peoples of Europe and then of him
self." In his role of poace-maker
tho Pope could not in tho very be
ginning outline a definite pro
gramme In regard to the solution of
tho question without unduly an
ticipating tho course or events and
tho designs of Dlvlno Providence.
Nat at all has he thought of the
Indoflnlto postponement of the mat-
tor. In due time can wo hope to
see the Papal attitude firmly an
nounced, and wo can also to some
degree bellevo that that attitude
will be the final ono adopted by the
Powers of Europe. C. B. of C. V.

JOHN J. BARRY WHARFMASTER
The prospective nominees for

tlio Democratic and Republican par
ties are in a tangle. The old-lino

the Roosevelt boom Which was

sprung by Wall street at tho Gary
dinner, and unless the other leading
candidates for the Republican nom
ination, Borah, Cummins and Fair
banks, combine their interests,
Teddy will steal away with tho
nomination In the coming conven-
tloruat- Chicago- . .- t .
The Bull Moose strength which
has floated back into tho Republi
can tanks is openly espousing tho
Rough Rider's cause, and with this
as an asset it is most probable that
he Is tho strongest man from an in
dividual standpoint, and just as
stated above, if the same is not
realized by the different contenders
Roosevelt is assured of success. Tho
Chicago Tribune describes tho situa
tion as "flabbergasted" in tho Re
publican ranks, and at this distance
the term is fairly applied. The only
solution Is for a caucus of tho anti
Roosevelt leaders which will enablo
them to unite on their strongest
candidate.
Tho Kentucky Irish American last
week in roviewlng the situation
from a Democratic standpoint stated
that President Wilson was not as
strong as ho was a year ago, and
this opinion has been commented
upon pretty freely, many being of
tho Opinion that it is not too lato
to chooso another standard-bearer,
while others say tho time for mak
ing a chango has passed and that
the Democratic party will nave to
sink or swim with Wilson as tho
nominee. The writer can hardly
agree with the Evening Post, which
In replying to a statement or tho
Fatherland, said "that the German
Americans do not vote as a unit and
have not in tho past." It is hardly
fair in summing this up to cite past
elections, as they can not be ac
cepted as a criterion. There has
never been a uko case, so to speaK,
the German-Americans believing
that they have been wronged as a
people .by the President during tho
European war controversy, and it
can bo taken for granted that they
will voto moro as a unit than at any
other time In their history. Thon
again tho Wilson policy in Moxieu
has been an unpopular one. '' rec
ognition of Carranza being a griev
ous mistake, and that this Is true is
seen in tho attitude of Roosevelt,
who, always ready to take tho pop
ular side of an Issue, has already
widely advertised his disapproval of
tho administration's Mexican policy.
But summing It all up, and unless
there Is a miraculous change in the
opinions of the leaders, Wilson will
again be tho nominee of tho Demo
crats, and in all probability Roose
velt will carry the Republican stand
ard. This will divide tho German
American vote, as both candidates
will be unfavorable from their
point of viow and tho is3uo then bo
fore tho American people will bo
"war or peace," with the latter an
odds-on favorite, insuring Wilson's
election in November.
Roosovolt's position was aptly
stated by the late Honoy-Boy Evans,
the minstrel man, in which ho told
his audience "that if Roosevelt was
President the war would done bo
over," and after a pause bo would
add "over hero." From a Kentucky
standpoint with the Democratic
party in power in State and Gov
ernment offices Wilson would bo
given a big majority, while right
hero in the Fifth district Congress
man Sherley, who in all probability
will be tho nominee for re-olectlon,
! would sweep tho district. But in
tho event Wilson is given the nom
ination and is opposed by somo old
line Republican who steers clear of
the war question and advocates
"back to prosperity" the Democrats
will have to hump themselves and
the Congressional nominee will have
a time to wln as four years ago
when an .unknown on the Bull
'ssssssHf MmnmW
Moose ticket came near carrying
this district because of the big vote
then given Teddy.
As forecasted in these columns,
Mayor Buschemeyer appointed John
J. Barry as Wharfmaster to succeeu
Frank Dugan, Circuit Clerk-elect,
and this appointment is pleasing to
overy man in the local Democratic
ranks, and especially the ward and
precinct workers, who realize and
appreciate tho splendid work in past
elections of the Fourth and Fmn
ward leader. It Is truly a reward
of merit and the Mayor's appoint
ment Is ratified by a unanimous
vote of tho "boys In the trenches."
Tho position pays $2,400 a year.

lisher of tho Irish World, aro tho
signatures to a lengthy call sent out
to Irish organizauJns in the United
States to attend a national conven

the call explains the object of tho
convention: "An atrocious war of
Intimidation is now progressing in
Great Britain nnd Ireland with all
the old fury and all tho ancient
cruelty. The slanders and sneers
of tho English are revived and flung
in tho faces of the helpless people,
and the Intolerance and bigotry

being flaunted insultingly." Repre
sentatives aro asked from divisions
of the A. O. H clubs of tho Clan-na-Gael,
'branches of the United
Irish League, Irish historical socie
ties, Irish National Foresters, etc.
The call says "there is more need
now for a congress of the race than

THREE SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED
Legislation will not solve the
moving picture problem on the edu
cational side. It will simply help
in tho solution of one-third of tho
Droblem. The moving picture
problem consists of three parts:
First, keeping out from exhibition
all immoral pictures and pictures
which incite to crime; second, keep
ing from children of an Impression
able age pictures haunful to them
by forming wrong ideals but not
particularly harmful to adults;
third, preventing the excessive uso
of tho moving picture as a type of
amusement for growing children.
Legislation providing for local
boards of censorship will help solve
tho first part of the problem by in
suring National Board cut-outs by
making cut-outs in feature films not
handled by National Board, and by
carrying out local Ideas on tho
moral values of tho pictures.
Tho conditions of tho moving pic
ture business must bo remembered.
Tho attendance of moving plcturo
shows is a big thing for the chil
dren, but tho attendance of children
is a small Item in moving plcturo
business. Investigation in several
cities has shown that week in and
week out tho attendance of children
under fourteen jears of ago is only
about 20 per cent, out of a total at
tendance of all classes of moving
picture houses. It is of course
higher in a so-called neighborhood
picture house than In a down-town
picture house. Now wo can not ex
pect moving plcturo men to run
their business for tho benefit of
omtfif th j.Jhelratrons although,
the attendance of that one-fifth,
since they aro children, may bo thq,
most Important part to society,
owing to the influence on char
acter. The problem Is to prevent
children from seeing pictures which
aro mushy or which present wrong
Ideals of action.
There aro three solutions of thl3
problem. First, children's days may
bo arranged in moving plcturo
shows possibly on Friday after
noons and evenings, if children aro
permitted to attend in tho evonlngj
Tho programmes may bo picked out
by somo ono selected by the school
board. Moving plcturo men are gen
erally ready to co-operato in this,
just as an advertising plan. Tho
tc&dency of such special days Is to
bunch tho attendance of tho chil
dren on tho days when theso pro
grammes come. It will not of courso
keep children away at other times.
Its advantage is that it can bo ear
ring nlt wIMlnllf n pnnaMnrnhla naf
of special installation of moving
picture apparatus In school build-
ings.
A second method Is to prepare
and havo published In tho papers
a white list of films appearing each
day. By falling to mention bad
films no advertisement Is given to
them. Tho shortcomings of this
method Is that good films may bo
mixed in with bad ones.
A third solution Is by tho intro
duction of moving plcturo apparatus
Into schools and churches with spe
cial programmes of pictures selected
with caro for their Interest jmd
wholesomeness. This gives com
plete control of the programme. It
would tend to draw children away
from moving plcturo housost - al
though It would not prevont their
attending regular houses and thou
sands would go every week as bo
fore. It would meet moro opposl-1
tion from tho proprietor of tho
small moving picture houses, who
could not afford to lose any consid
erable portion of even one-fifth of
their patronage. The managers of
the big houses frequently co-operato
In enforcing laws keeping children
out after certain hours and might
co-operato In such competitive film
exhibitions, for tho simple reason
that tho attendance of children is
not a largo item.
A third educational difficulty and
a very important ono in tho use of
moving pictures with . children is ,
that it leads to an excessive uso of
tho passive forms of recreation
Character is not built chiefly by sit
ting and watching things. CharaiA
ter Is a bundle of habits and is
foimed by doing things. Just as
instruction is not tho wholo of edu
cation, so the passive forms of rec
reation should not bo a predominant
part in child life. Tho solution of
this is tho building up of an ade
quate recreation system, which will
furnish other forms of more active
recreation which will more gen-
