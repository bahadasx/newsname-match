He le resolved that the Western

Wo believe that the two mlllfon Ne
Krtjes capuble of hearing arms should
bo given an opportunity in all our
states and territories to obtain that
military training both as offcers and
privates that Is absolutely necessary
In n well organized government; and
to this end. we earnestly suggest that
the various states ub well as the gov
ernment put nslde their prejudices
towurd tho Negro nnd assist In train
ing and molding this tremendous force
Into a splendid defensive machine.
The Negro tins demonstrated Ills
bravery as well as loyalty upon many

"Muskogee has reiison for sincere
and heartfelt self-congiatulailon to
day. That mob violence und rare
prejudice were not permitted to break
loose In unreleased fury as a result
of the killing of Policeman Neal and
the capture of his murderers is almost
a miracle. It was a serious mistake
to lodge the prisoners in the county
Jail, and almost cremlunl neglect to
permit a small crowd to rongregati
about the ja.l during Sunday after
noon when a few officers by vlgoious
action could havo dlpers d the
ch)Wd. Thobe arc nil matters, how ov
er, of liIndslKht When Judge di

uation he called out the mate mall tie,
and Commissioner I'alteisou ordered
out all tho police restive This dls-
filay of force wont a long way to curb
ng the cruwd. frobubly most credit
for preventing a nioM unfortunate sit
nation Is due v SColonel Mbrton
Rutherford and W H. Twine. At 10
o'clock Sunday night several hun
dred armed negroes were congregat
ed north of the jail, and about a
thousand WIiIUm wire gathered In the
streets south of the jail It only need
ed a thoughtless shot to let loose the
tury. Mayor Miller sent for Twine,
ho responded Instantly, and under
the mayor's instructions succeeded in
getting the negroes to quietly leave
the vicinity of the JaU. About this
tlm Colonel Rutherford 1dressed
tho crowd and then led the movement
'to drive the crowd back from the Jail
Adj. Gen. lanton, one of the level
headid men of the state, took charge
of the troops This was a master
stroke which made the crowd ridicu
lous In its owu eyes. The sheriff's
office deserves credit for the rather
bold, nnd aggieishe manner in which
the prisoners wern taken from tho
Jail and sp.iiti d out of tho city.
Muskogee Is to be congratulated thnt
the majesty of the law rather than
violence of the mob predominated In
ending the fiasco."
