REJECTS CARTER
Little Whiskers, the Senator, is Accept
able, but Sullivan Will Only Make
Peace with Harrison Left Out.
The Battle tor Delegates, Committeeships and Other
Big Plums Taking Up Attention of
Local Statesmen.
Wet and Dry Question Will Cut a Big Figure in Next
Year's Battle Throughout the State
of Illinois.
Factions in Both the Big Parties Are Making a Hard Fight for
the Control of the Managing Committees.
Little Whiskers, the urbane and
CheiterAeldian senior United Statea
Senator from Illinois, whoso term ex
pires year after next, Is back In Chi
cago to spend the holidays.
With the rapidly coming senatorial
fight In mind he Is anxious to see tho
-Democrats getting together.
While In Washington he had a con
ference with Roger O. Sullivan and
George E. Drennan, who wero In the
capital for tho purpose of securing
the Democratic national convention
for Chicago.
Little Whiskers urged upon these
two gentlemen the necessity for
peace, although as both of them
strongly favored WlUon, the reason
for a sudden powwow was not easily
mado plain.
Sullivan said that ho had no ob
jection to a Joint ticket,' providing
Carter Harrison was left off the list
of delegates at large.
He said that ho would not stand
for Harrison for anything.
Ho denounced Harrison as a trai
tor and declared that the action of
the Harrison party In supporting
Thompson for mayor last spring put
him outside of the Democratic party.
Little Whiskers Is not the kind of
an Indian Chief who gives up easily.
Good nature Is a strong weapon of
hla when honora are in sight, so when
you read the following Interview giv
en out by him In Chicago, you can
draw your own conclusions:
"The prospects are bright for an
agreement by which both elements of
the party shall be represented among
the delegates to tho national conven
tion," he said, "with one set of dele
gates running. The eight delegates-at-large
easily could be divided, for
instance, between such representative
leaders as Carter H. Harrison and
Roger C. Sullivan.
"The Illinois delegation will be
solid for Mr. Wilson, and I believe
matters can be arranged so that only
one set ,wlll be nominated In each
Congressional district. The proposal
to give a united party aupport to
ttose state and county officers who
desire a renominatlon also probably
will meet with favor all around."

Man Who Can Carry

CITY HALL HOT STUFF
Third Ward Republicans Split Up

ORIGINAL JjllLSON MAN
Rivers McNeill Was the First
Man in Illinois to Declare for
Wilson for President.
Rivers McNeill .Was for Woodrow
Wilson for president In 1911. He was
the first man that mentioned Wil
son's name for thekexalted position to
the editor of The Eaglo, and that
was In the year named.
In January, 19l2 at a luncheon, at
which John McGlllen, the editor of
The Eagle, and others were present,
Roger C. Sullivan said:
"Gentlemen, I feel very friendly to
Champ Clark of 'Missouri. .He will
get our delegation because of neigh
borly feeling and tils good record as
a Democrat. But 1 .cannot help feeling
that Woodrow Wilson of New Jet
Bey Is the strongest man who could
be nominated. It 1 had the naming of
the candldato I would pick Wilson.
He Is a winner."
These are the facts, and are only
printed out of a desire to get the real
truth Into print, with reference to
the original Wllsoti man. Many of tho
fellows who are now claiming to have
been the first to be for Wilson in this
section of the country, did not know
that Wilson was alive, so far as their
utterances were cohcerncd, when Mc
Neill and Sullivan were sounding his
praises. You can net on this.
HOYNE'S FAME NA
TIONAL The Courageous State's Attorney
Would Make an Ideal Candi
date fof Vice President.
Maclay Hoyno Is the one Democrat
in the West who has attracted the.
attention ot the country on account or
his fearless administration of his great
office.
The New York state's attorney has
frequently attracted jiatton-wido at
tention by hla MUclsB'on gratters.
Chicago, the central metropolis ot
the country, holds the attention of the
American peoplo to a greater extent
than any other city.
That is why Maclay Hoyno Is today
a National Character.
His fearless prosecution ot crooked
policemen, who belloved themselves
to bo all powerful, has won for him
n placo In American politics that will
grow with time.
This was only ono of a hundred vic
tories won by him for tho cause ot
right and Justice.
Illinois could havo no stronger can
didate for National honors to offer
to tho Democratic party at St. Louis
next summer.
Tlioro Is no Illlnoisan named In any
party for high national preferment
now, whose record can at all compare
with that ot Hoyno.
Ho has done things.
And what he has dono has been for
tho public good.
Wilson and Hoyno would be an in
vincible combination.

Alleging tho stealing of millions ot

The Thompson administration raised

Why was it clamped down again so

The Popular Manufacturer Will
Be Sent to the National Re
publican Convention in
Ninth District.
William Wrlgley Jr. Is the popular
choice for delegate to the Republican
National Convention from the Ninth
district.
William Wrlgley, Jr., financier and
manufacturer, one ot the financial
mainstays of the Roosevelt campaign
In 1912, has deserted the bull moose
and will be a candidate for delegate
to the Republican national conven
tion of 1910 from the Ninth congres
sional district
The return of Mr. Wrlgley to the
republican fold Is one of the hardest
blows received by the progressives
In the west. Three years ago be was
at the forefront of the bull moose of
fensive and carried with him the ban
ner not only of a large personal fol
lowing In Chicago, but also hundreds
of business men In all parts of the
United States who banked on his
political as well as his business judg
ment. He contributed to the bull
moose national campaign the sum of
a Public and Political
State and All Parties
25,000, tho largest amount subscrib
ed by a Chlcagoan.
"I am with Teddy for anything ho
wants from dog catcher to czar," said
Mr. Wrlgley, as ho handed his check
to Ralph Otis, treasurer ot the bull
mooso campaign.
Cut now hu believes that the field
of activity for progressiva republicans
Is back In tho O. O. P. In order to
fight for his convictions In tho party
councils ho has decided to ask the
republicans of tuo Ninth district to
to send him as a delegate to tho na
tional convention. When he announces
his candidacy formally he will declare
hlmsolf for United States Senator
Lawrenco Y. Sherman, favorito son of
Illinois, for tho nomination for presi
